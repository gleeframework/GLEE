"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it allows for room to negotiate and hopefully find a price point that benefits both of us.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,700,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's also a significant step down from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this price is more appealing to Bob while still staying within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us, I'm not willing to go that far below my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000.  I'm hoping this price is more appealing to Bob, as it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate further while still staying within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,400,000. This is a lower price than my previous counteroffer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I am willing to compromise, and that we are getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, we're running out of time. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, I might end up with a lower price than I'm willing to accept. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to go with that option."
