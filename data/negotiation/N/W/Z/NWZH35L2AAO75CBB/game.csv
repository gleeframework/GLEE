"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $9000. If that's not acceptable, I'll need to look elsewhere.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
