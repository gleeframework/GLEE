While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $725,000. I'll counteroffer Bob again, but if he continues to refuse, I'll consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While I'm still hoping to get a better price, Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower. I've only got a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with. It's time to secure a sale with John for $800,000."
