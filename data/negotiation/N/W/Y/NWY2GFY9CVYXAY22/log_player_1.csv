"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a price significantly closer to our desired value ($1,500,000) than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a strong initial position. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though we haven't revealed specifics. 
* **Leaving Room:** We don't want to start too close to $1,500,000 because it might discourage Bob from negotiating at all.  

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while leaving open the possibility of a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, leaving us with no profit. While we want to secure a deal, accepting this early would be a significant loss. We have room to negotiate and the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This recognizes its value while offering you a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (But Not Too Much):**  We've come down from our initial offer, signaling willingness to negotiate. However, the decrease is substantial enough to show we're serious but not desperate.  $1,350,000 keeps us well above Bob's offer and maintains a path toward a profitable agreement.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value without being overly aggressive. The phrase ""meet in the middle"" frames the counteroffer as a reasonable compromise. 
* **Pressure:** By emphasizing fairness, we subtly put the onus back on Bob to make a reasonable move in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now engaging in the negotiation and moving closer to our range, $1,275,000 is still a significant profit loss. We're only in Round 4, so we have time to apply pressure and aim higher.  John's standing offer provides a safety net if we need to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm serious about closing a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're showing movement but in a smaller increment ($25,000) than before. This signals that we're nearing our limit and adds weight to the ""final offer"" statement.
* **Time Pressure:** By stating this is our final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency.  
* **Justification:**  We're again connecting the price to the value Bob gains, reinforcing that we're not just negotiating for the sake of it.
* **Future Options:** While this is our ""final offer"" in this negotiation phase, if Bob rejects it, we can still choose to accept his next counteroffer or walk away to John. This strategy keeps the control in our hands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we meet at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:**  $1,300,000 is a strong profit margin, even though it falls short of our initial target. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently moved closer to our price, demonstrating genuine interest. This latest offer is a significant jump from his earlier positions. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, prolonging the negotiation further might not yield significantly better results. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away.  

**Key Takeaway:**  In negotiations, securing a good deal often means finding a balance between maximizing profit and understanding when to capitalize on a favorable offer."
