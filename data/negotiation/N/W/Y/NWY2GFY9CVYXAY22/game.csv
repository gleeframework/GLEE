"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This recognizes its value while offering you a fair deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm serious about closing a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
