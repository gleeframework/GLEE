"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me, and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
