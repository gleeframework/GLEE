Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I think $125 is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While we could try to push Alice closer to $120, there's a risk she won't go any lower. Accepting at $125 is a good deal, saving $15 from her initial offer and only $5 more than John's price."
