Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By offering $9,500, I'm leaving room for Bob to counter with a lower price, while still making a profit.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm aware that John is willing to buy for $10,000, so I can always fall back on him if Bob doesn't agree to a price that works for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $8,000 for this product. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $10,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it's not completely unreasonable. There's room for negotiation, and I can try to meet him halfway.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000, so I can afford to be firm with Bob.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go down to $8,500, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still allow me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintaining profit:** $9,000 is still above my minimum price of $10,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Clear communication:** I'm explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $10,000.
* **I'm confident in my position:** I know that John is willing to buy for $10,000, so I don't need to rush into accepting a lower offer. 
* **Further negotiation possible:** While Bob's offer is closer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more.  How about we settle on $9,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that both of us can be happy with."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer but still lower than my previous counteroffer. This shows continued willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above minimum:** $9,250 is still above my minimum price of $10,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Final push:** I'm making this a final push to reach a deal with Bob before moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. However, I am still committed to staying within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $8,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** Bob's offer of $8,900 is still below my minimum price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of going back and forth:** I've already made several concessions, and it's unlikely that Bob will budge much further.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  John is a sure sale at $10,000, which is a much better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000 to ensure I get the best possible price."
