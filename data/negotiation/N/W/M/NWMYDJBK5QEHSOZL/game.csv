"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize you see the value in this product,  $1,800,000 undervalues its true potential and the returns you stand to gain. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
