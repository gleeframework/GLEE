"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm testing the waters with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate from there.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not satisfied with that. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll try to find a middle ground in my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. $17,500 is a good compromise that's still higher than my minimum while showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is a good deal considering we only have 6 rounds left.  It's better than John's offer of $15,000 and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate."
