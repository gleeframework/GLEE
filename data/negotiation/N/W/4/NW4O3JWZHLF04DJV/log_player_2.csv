{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate. Alice's offer is significantly lower than the fallback price of $1,500,000, so there's room for a better deal. We have 10 rounds, so we can afford to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing we're serious about getting a better deal.  We're starting with a lower price point to give Alice some room to counter and hopefully find a middle ground."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

We're increasing our counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal. We're aiming for a price that's closer to our desired price range but still leaves room for potential concessions from Alice."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is getting closer to our desired price, we're still within range to potentially secure a better deal. We've already rejected Alice's previous offers, demonstrating our commitment to negotiating a lower price. Continuing to negotiate gives us the best chance of saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our offer again, showing that we're willing to meet Alice halfway.  $800,000 represents a good compromise point, significantly lower than Alice's last offer while still being a reasonable price. With only a few rounds left, we need to find a solution that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to our last counteroffer. With only three rounds remaining, it's likely we won't get a significantly lower price.  Accepting this offer allows us to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a much higher price."
