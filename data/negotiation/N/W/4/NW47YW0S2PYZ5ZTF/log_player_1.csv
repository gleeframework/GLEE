Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($12,000) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $11,999 feels significantly lower than $12,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a sale."
