"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. It shows you're serious about this product. To be frank, $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but the value this product brings is substantial. How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
