# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $12000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
