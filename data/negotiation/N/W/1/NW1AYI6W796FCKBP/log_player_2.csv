"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You want to save as much money as possible, and $140 is still too expensive. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$135 is still more than you want to pay, but you are getting closer to a deal. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to come down in price.  $135 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
