"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value may be different for you. Let's start at $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering $85, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within my budget.
* **Reasoning:** I acknowledge Alice's offer but highlight that it's still too high for me. This sets the tone for negotiation and shows willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness:**  The offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find a middle ground. How about $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $95 is still above my budget of $80. It is in my best interest to continue negotiating for a lower price. I still have a good chance of getting a better deal from Alice or purchasing from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $90. It's a fair compromise and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Change:**  I'm offering a smaller increment of $5 this time, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Fairness:**  $90 is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer of $85 and Alice's offer of $95.
* **Positive Tone:** I reiterate appreciation for Alice's flexibility and express hope for a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your latest offer, how about we meet in the middle at $87 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer of $87 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still determined to get the best possible deal.  I'm confident that I can either:

* **Negotiate further with Alice:**  A small counteroffer from me might push her closer to my ideal price.
* **Buy from John:** If negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80. 

By rejecting this offer, I keep the negotiation alive and have a chance to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget. How about $85? It's just a small adjustment, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Adjustment:**  I'm offering a small increase from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Finality:**  I'm emphasizing the potential for finalizing the deal, making it more appealing for Alice to accept.
* **Maintaining Budget:**  $85 remains within my budget, making this a safe and reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try $86. It's a slight increase from your last offer, but it also respects your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $86 is very close to my budget and only $6 above John's offer.  I've already negotiated significantly, and at this point, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will just take more time and might not result in a much lower price.  It's time to accept the deal and move on."
