"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to start high, at $11,000. This is above Bob's value, but I need to leave room for negotiation. I also know John is willing to pay $10,000, so this gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my target price.  While $10,000 from John is tempting, I'll see if I can get closer to that with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's value and closer to my desired price. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if I can get much higher.  I'm also aware that John is a reliable buyer and I can always go to him if this deal falls through.  For now, I'll accept Bob's offer."
