# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth starting the negotiation process and seeing if we can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering what I'm looking for and  what I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a good compromise that allows both of us to make a deal. Let's work together to finalize this."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. My next offer is $10,200 for the product. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still higher than my target price. I've had 5 rounds of negotiations and it seems unlikely that Alice will come down to my desired price.  It's time to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
