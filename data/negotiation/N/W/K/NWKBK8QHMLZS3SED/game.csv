"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering what I'm looking for and  what I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. My next offer is $11,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a good compromise that allows both of us to make a deal. Let's work together to finalize this.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. My next offer is $10,200 for the product. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",10200.0,Alice,5,
