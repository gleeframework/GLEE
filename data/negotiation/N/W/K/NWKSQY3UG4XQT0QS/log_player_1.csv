Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is higher than your minimum price of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $100, so there's potential for him to counter-offer and for you to negotiate a price closer to his value.
* **It's a strong initial offer:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value, but are open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is a decent offer, it's still below your desired profit margin. You can likely get closer to your goal by counter-offering. You can also consider the fact that John is willing to pay $80 - if you can't get a higher offer from Bob, you have a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? It's the highest I can go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87 is closer to your desired price point, it's still a bit low, and you want to see if you can get closer to $90. Also, remember that John is a backup option who is willing to pay $80. You have the advantage of a backup offer, which gives you more leverage to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $87 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88.50.  It's a fair compromise and the best I can do right now.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 88.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. Would you be willing to meet me at $86? It's the absolute highest I can go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $86 is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still not ideal. At this point, you've already negotiated several rounds and you have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay $80.  There's a good chance you could continue negotiating with Bob, but it's becoming increasingly time-consuming and it's uncertain if you'll be able to reach a price that truly meets your expectations.  Selling to John ensures you get a guaranteed $80, which is still a profitable sale, and allows you to move on to other opportunities."
