Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can move forward from there."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $2,250,000 (1.5 times its value to both of you) aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is phrased to invite a counter-offer from Bob, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a price that works for both parties. 

By starting high and being prepared to negotiate, you maximize your chances of getting the best possible price from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
