Alice's starting price is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $100?  That's fair to both of us, and it's a great deal for you on a fantastic product.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in further negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
