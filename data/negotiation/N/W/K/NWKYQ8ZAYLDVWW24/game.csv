"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This reflects the unique benefits this product offers and leaves us both with a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $975,000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above the $1,000,000 mark. Let's settle at $1,025,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
