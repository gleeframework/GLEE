"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. I'm asking for $1500000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1400000 is a good offer, it's slightly below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $1450000? This would still be a significant investment for you, but it also allows me to make a fair profit. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're able to find common ground. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I propose a price of $1425000. This offers a bit more flexibility while still ensuring a fair transaction for both parties.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
