{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's worth exploring negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price, knowing that I have a fallback option with John. This sets a clear boundary and hopefully encourages Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is a significant discount from my original price.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there's still room for us to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm serious about reaching a deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12250?  I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $12,250 is still over my comfort zone. I'm going to counteroffer once more before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  My absolute maximum is $11,750.  This would allow us to both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my budget but making a slight concession to show I'm still open to negotiation. I'm hoping this small adjustment will be enough for Alice to accept and avoid having to purchase from John."
