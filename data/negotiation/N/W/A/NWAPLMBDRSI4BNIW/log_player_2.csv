"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $12,000 is still significantly higher than our ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it starts the negotiation process and leaves us room to work our way up."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to our ideal price, we're still not there yet. We're still in early rounds of the negotiation, so let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,000 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

We are moving closer to a possible agreement, but we still have some room to negotiate.  This counteroffer shows Alice we are serious but still aiming for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're working with a tight budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could push Alice further, $8,500 is close enough to our $8,000 limit. It's not worth the risk of losing the deal by pushing too hard, especially since John is offering the same price."
