"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I will reject Bob's offer of $80. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, my product is worth significantly more to me. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which still leaves me a fair profit. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob. There's a good chance I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $95 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. I've already come down significantly from my initial price, and this is my final offer before I have to consider selling to another buyer.  Let me know if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with this offer yet. I want to see if I can push for a bit more before considering John's offer.  I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $100 still falls short of what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is truly my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 105}
