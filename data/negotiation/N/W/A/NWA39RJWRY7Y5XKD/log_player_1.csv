"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I have 9 rounds left and there's potential to negotiate a better price or sell to John for my full desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair price considering the value I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $12,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $12,200 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price. We are already 4 rounds in, and there's no guarantee that Bob will be willing to pay any more. However, I still have 6 more rounds left to get a better offer or to secure the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $12,200 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,300, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile deal."", ""product_price"": 12300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your last offer, and I'd like to make one more attempt at a compromise. My counteroffer is now $12,100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,300. We are already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and there is no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further. Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $15,000. It's better to secure the deal with John now than to risk a potentially lower price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
