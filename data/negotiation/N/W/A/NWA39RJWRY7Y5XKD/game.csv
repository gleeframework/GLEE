"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair price considering the value I'm offering.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $12,200 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,300, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile deal.",12300.0,Alice,5,
