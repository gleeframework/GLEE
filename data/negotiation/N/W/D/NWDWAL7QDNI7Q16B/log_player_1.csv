Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hopeful Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $90 is a good deal considering Bob's counteroffer. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price or a sale to John for only $80."
