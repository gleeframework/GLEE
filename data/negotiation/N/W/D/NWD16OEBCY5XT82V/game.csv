"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $140 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $155. It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know if you're interested.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $155 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $150?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
