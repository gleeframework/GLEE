"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the details you've shared about the product. While I see its potential, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to offer $100 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm seeking.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Bob,2,
