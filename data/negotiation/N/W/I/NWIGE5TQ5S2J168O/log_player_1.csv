"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum of $100. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping this will show good faith and encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $105, Bob is now offering $95, which is only $5 below my minimum. With limited rounds left, it's better to accept his offer than risk losing the deal completely."
