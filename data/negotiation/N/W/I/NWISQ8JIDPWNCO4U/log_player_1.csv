**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's very price-sensitive and unlikely to meet my minimum of $80. Continuing the negotiation might result in a slightly higher offer from Bob, but the risk of him walking away increases with each round. John's guaranteed $80 offer is now the safer and more profitable option."
