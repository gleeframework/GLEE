"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $70 is significantly lower than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That's a very fair offer.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we try $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $77.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I could be persuaded to accept $82. This is my final offer.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with $82. I was thinking more along the lines of $79. Can you meet me at that price?,79.0,Bob,6,
