``` 

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this offer right away. This will give me room to negotiate and still get a price higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is better than my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $92 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference -  how about $93.50?  It's a fair compromise and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 93.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price, as John is willing to pay $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I understand you're trying to save money, but $91 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence! However, $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It's getting late in the negotiation, and while I'd like to get more than $90,  I don't think Bob is going to go any higher.  John is a guaranteed sale at $100, so I'm going to sell to him."
