Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  $125 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential concessions.
* **Being Friendly:**  A friendly tone can help establish a positive rapport and encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is better than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I might be able to get closer to my desired price.
* **Not Rushing:**  Selling to John guarantees $150, but I want to explore if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Strategically:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **High Enough:** $115 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone can keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $105. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on a guaranteed sale to John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures a profit of $150, which is the best outcome in this scenario."
