Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $12,000 is a decent starting point, allowing for potential concessions while still ensuring I earn more than Bob's value.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Note:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option, ensuring I can secure at least my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000, and even below my initial offer of $12,000.  
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob through further negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Fairness:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value Bob will still receive at this price.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. 

I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm being flexible to avoid losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $9,750 is still significantly below my desired price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $15,000, giving me the leverage to push for a higher price with Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  There's still a possibility that I can convince Bob to go higher.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $9,750 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference one last time and settle at $10,125.  I'm confident you'll find this a great deal for such a valuable product.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a final attempt to reach a compromise by splitting the difference again. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to sway him to accept.
* **Call to Action:** I'm using a strong call to action to encourage Bob to finalize the deal. 

While I'm still below my ideal price, I'm willing to make a small concession to secure a deal with Bob. However, if this is rejected, I'll move forward with selling to John for $15,000."
