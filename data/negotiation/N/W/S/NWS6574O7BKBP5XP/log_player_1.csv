{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive, hoping to build a rapport and encourage him to accept my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to sell the product, $120 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum price, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept it because it's only $20 less than my minimum, and it's possible that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away and I'll be left with only the $150 offer from John."
