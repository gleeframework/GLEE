"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a significant offer, the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down a bit further and propose a price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
