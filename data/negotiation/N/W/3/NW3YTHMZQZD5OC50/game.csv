"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  $120 is a bit out of my budget, but I'm definitely interested. How about $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product! After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go to $100. This would allow us to finalize the deal and you'd still get a fair price. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not ready to give up yet! I'm willing to meet you at $105, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
