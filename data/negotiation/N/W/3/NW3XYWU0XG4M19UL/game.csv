"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle, how about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could you consider $9,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to close this deal. How about $10,500? This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
