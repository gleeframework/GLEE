"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
