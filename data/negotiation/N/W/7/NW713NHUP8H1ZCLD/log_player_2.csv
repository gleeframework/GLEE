"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, going $4,000 below Alice's initial price. 
* This demonstrates Bob's seriousness in purchasing the product but also his firm stance on the price. 
* This counteroffer sets a clear starting point for negotiation and allows for potential concessions in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's budget of $12,000.
* It is in Bob's best interest to continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price.  
* While Jhon is a reliable option, Bob still has time to potentially get a better deal from Alice.  
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a new counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that this product will be a great investment for me."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is increasing his offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* $12,500 is a good midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's current price.
* This offer is still within Bob's budget, allowing for some room for negotiation.
*  By stating it's his final offer, Bob puts pressure on Alice to make a decision."
