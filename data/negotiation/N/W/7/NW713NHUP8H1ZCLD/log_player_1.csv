"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that this product will be a great investment for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $12,500 is significantly better than selling to John for $10,000. It's also a good compromise, considering I've already lowered my price from my initial asking price."
