"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of your product, that price point seems a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. It's still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $720,000?",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $720,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000. It's getting closer to my target, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to sell and I'm motivated to buy. How about we split the difference and call it $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! Splitting the difference is a good idea. However, I was thinking of a price of $780,000. It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",780000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to meet you at $770,000.  This is a very fair offer.  What do you say?",770000.0,Bob,8,
