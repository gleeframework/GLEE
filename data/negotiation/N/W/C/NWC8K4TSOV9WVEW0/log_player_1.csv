Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'll start with a price that's a bit higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $170}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, so I'll reject it. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": $130}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send the counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $130}

This is a bit higher than Bob's original offer, but still lower than my original price. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
