Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below what the product is worth to me. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm proposing $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach an agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise,  $1,325,000 still falls short of what I believe is fair.  I'm willing to go down to $1,340,000. This is a very close to your offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to push the price as high as possible, but at $1,340,000, we're getting a decent discount. Holding out for a slightly lower price might backfire, as Alice seems firm, and we risk her withdrawing the offer completely.  It's better to secure the deal now and avoid the risk of paying John's full price."
