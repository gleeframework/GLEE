Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and highlights the potential benefit for Bob.
* **The alternative buyer, John** is a safety net. This means I can afford to be more aggressive with Bob, as I have a guaranteed sale for $1,000,000 if Bob declines."
