,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is way too low for me. I could maybe meet you halfway though. How about $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $90 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $70? That would work much better for me.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is cutting it too close to what I can do. Let's make this final offer: $85, and we have a deal. This is my best price.",85.0,Alice,5,
