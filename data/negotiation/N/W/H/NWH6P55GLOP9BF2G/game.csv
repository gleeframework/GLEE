,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering you a deal at $105. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to go up to $95. If you're open to that, I think we can make a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a deal at $102.50. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
