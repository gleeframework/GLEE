Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $30 markup (20% increase) is a reasonable starting point. It provides room for negotiation while still being a significant gain if Bob accepts. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob's interest."
