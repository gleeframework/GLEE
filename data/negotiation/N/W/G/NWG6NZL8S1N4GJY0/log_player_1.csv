Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $120 gives Alice a strong fallback position. This allows her to be more confident in aiming for a higher price with Bob."
