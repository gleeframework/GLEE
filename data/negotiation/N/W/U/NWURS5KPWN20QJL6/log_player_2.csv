"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still too high.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,225,000. However, I need to be upfront, this is my final offer. I'm confident the value this product brings will far exceed this price.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still a bit higher than what Bob wants to pay.  Bob is not desperate and has the option to buy from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a final counteroffer before making the decision to buy from John."
