"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
