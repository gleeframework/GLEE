"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I can offer you a compromise at $1,050,000. This is still a good value for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
