"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and it's worth $15,000 to someone like you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm a bit flexible, but I'd like to get a good deal.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from it.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $13,250 is the best price for this product. I'd like to make another offer of $12,750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I can't go as low as $12,750, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another offer of $12,900. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",12900.0,Bob,6,
