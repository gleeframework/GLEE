Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 13250}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another offer of $12,900. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly very close to his maximum price and pushing him further risks him walking away. Accepting $12,900 is a good deal and better than the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
