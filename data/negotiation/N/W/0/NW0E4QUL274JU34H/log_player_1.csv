{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you! My asking price is $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate and still get a profit higher than my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to hopefully build rapport with Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts, inviting him to engage in the negotiation. 

This initial offer is a good starting point. I'll be ready to adjust based on Bob's response and continue to maximize my profit!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still have room to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price. 

I'm not in a rush to sell. John is a backup option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This gives you a good deal, and it still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm making a counteroffer at $110. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum and allows for a potential profit of $30.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer, emphasizing the value Bob gets at this price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm again asking for Bob's feedback, encouraging him to continue the negotiation. 

This counter-offer is a calculated move to try and secure a deal that's mutually beneficial. I'll be ready to adjust further if needed, but I'm confident this offer will be enticing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. However, I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal. 

* **Negotiation Space:** Even though $90 is only $10 above my minimum, there's still some room for me to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob is truly interested in the product and will be willing to come up a little more.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $80 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm not yet ready to give up on Bob. I believe there's still a chance I can get a slightly better price.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $90 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a final compromise by lowering my price to $95. This is a good balance between what I want and what Bob is offering.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a good deal for both of us. 
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm showing enthusiasm to encourage Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal.

This counteroffer is my final attempt to get a price closer to my desired outcome. If Bob rejects this, I'll accept his previous offer of $90 or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While it's not ideal, it's still a decent profit.  

* **Time Factor:**  This negotiation has gone on for a few rounds. It's likely that continuing to negotiate further won't lead to a significantly better price. 
* **Risk of Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer and try to counter-offer, there's a risk he'll walk away, leaving me with only the $80 offer from John.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing a sale altogether."
