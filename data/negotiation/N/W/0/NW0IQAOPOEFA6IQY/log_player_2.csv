"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the details. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's also interested in purchasing it for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save money, and John is willing to sell the product for the same price as Alice, you are indifferent between buying from either of them. However, the prompt specifies that you will buy from John if you reject Alice's offer. Therefore, the optimal decision is to ""BuyFromJhon""."
