"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $80.  Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $80, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a compromise at $105. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",105.0,Alice,5,
