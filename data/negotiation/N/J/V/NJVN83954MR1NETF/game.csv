"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to find some middle ground. How about $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, but you're not quite there yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'll meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is important to you, and I'm willing to be flexible, but $8,000 is just a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,500?  It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal today.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I've already made concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000. I'm willing to hold firm on this price, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at $8,000, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Alice,7,
