Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we know Bob values the product at $8,000 and we have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, starting with a higher offer makes sense. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than Bob's perceived value by mentioning ""its value"".
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and ends with an open question, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he's interested.

**Strategy:**

Ideally, Bob accepts the $12,000 offer, netting a higher profit. If he rejects it, we can always fall back to John's offer, ensuring we get our minimum desired price."
