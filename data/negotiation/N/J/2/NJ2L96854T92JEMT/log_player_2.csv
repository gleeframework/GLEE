"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price. To start, I'm asking for $1,000,000. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to start significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give ourselves room to negotiate upward. 
* **But Not Too Low:**  Offering something too low (like $500,000) could be insulting and stall negotiations. 
* **Aiming for Under Budget:** My goal is to get the product well under my $1,200,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a little lower than I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still gives you a significant benefit, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice moved a bit on her price, $950,000 is still too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and rounds left.  Let's keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me.  To be honest, though, I need to be closer to $800,000 to make this work.  How about $875,000?"", ""product_price"": 875000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, but not by much. This signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning my target price range, I'm giving Alice a reason to take my offer seriously. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to land somewhere between our current positions, encouraging a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $912,500.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  While Alice is suggesting a ""middle ground,""  $912,500 is still a significant markup from her $800,000 value. We have time and rounds to see if she'll come down further. 
* **Holding Firm:** By continuing to reject offers in this range, we're signaling to Alice that we're serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $890,000. I feel this is a fair offer, considering the value this product brings to my business."", ""product_price"": 890000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  We're increasing our offer again, but by a smaller increment than before. This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but are approaching our limit. 
* **Justification:** By tying the product's value to our business needs, we're subtly reminding Alice of its worth and potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer aims to see how much further Alice is willing to drop her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a very fair price, considering the significant value this product brings to your business.  Let's finalize this deal, and we can both move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $900,000 is significantly below my $1,200,000 maximum budget.
* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and I'm satisfied with this price.
* **Time Factor:**  We're over halfway through the rounds. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation stalling and having to settle for John's higher price."
