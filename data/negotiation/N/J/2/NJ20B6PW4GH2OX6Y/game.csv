"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice.  $900,000 is a bit steep for me, but I'm interested.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $800,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is already a compromise on my part, considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
