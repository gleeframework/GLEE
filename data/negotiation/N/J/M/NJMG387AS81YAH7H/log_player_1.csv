Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000 is a good starting point.** It's above your minimum price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** This helps set a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **It's important to establish your value early on.** By mentioning the product is ""worth a lot to you,"" you subtly imply that it's worth more than the initial offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500 is closer to your minimum but still not ideal.**  While you could accept it, there's still some room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer.** This shows Bob you're serious about getting a better price and keeps the negotiation going.

You'll likely want to make a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still higher than your minimum, such as $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,500 is a reasonable compromise.** It's a halfway point between your previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that you're willing to negotiate.
* **The message emphasizes the value of the product.** This helps justify your price and reminds Bob of the benefits of acquiring it.
* **It's important to be assertive but polite.** This helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway!"
