Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150, but let me know if you'd like to discuss the price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's profitable for you. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying ""let me know if you'd like to discuss the price,"" I signal that I'm open to negotiation, which might make Bob more comfortable making a counter-offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize that the product would be ""perfect"" for Bob, subtly suggesting it's worth the higher price.

While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright, there's also a chance he'll counter-offer, giving me the opportunity to potentially sell above my minimum price of $100. If he rejects the offer, I haven't lost anything, as I can still sell to John for $100."
