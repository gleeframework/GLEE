,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value I'm expecting it to bring.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm still not convinced that it's enough to cover the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1800000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $1600000 is a fair price, reflecting both the product's value and my budget constraints.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is a compromise, but I'm hoping we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1650000 for the product. This price is fair and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",1650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1650000 is enough to cover the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $1700000 was already my last offer, but I'm now willing to go slightly lower to $1680000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1680000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1680000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value I'm expecting from this product.  Let's meet in the middle, at $1660000. It's a good compromise for both of us.",1660000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1660000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $1675000. This is my absolute last offer, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1675000.0,Alice,9,
