"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I believe it's a very fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than your ideal price and you have room to negotiate.  You should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to meet in the middle of your ideal price and Alice's starting price. By being polite and expressing continued interest, you increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $130 is a fair initial offer, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to your desired price point. While you could try to negotiate further, $120 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice withdrawing the offer or you spending more time haggling for a potentially small gain."
