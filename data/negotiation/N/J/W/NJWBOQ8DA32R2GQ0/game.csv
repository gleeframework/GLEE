"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer given the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair offer that's closer to my budget and gives you a good deal considering your initial asking price. Let's try to make this work.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate you getting closer to my price.  $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $925,000, but this is my final offer.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",925000.0,Alice,5,
