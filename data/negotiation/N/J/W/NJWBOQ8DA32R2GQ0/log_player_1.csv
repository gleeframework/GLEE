{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but below my own minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Showing Flexibility:** My message emphasizes that I'm open to negotiation. This encourages Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's insulting me.
* **Safeguard:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not risking much by going for a higher price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a higher price by counteroffering.
* **John as a Backup:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer given the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Show Flexibility:** I'm emphasizing that this is a significant discount from my initial offer to show I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to subtly influence Bob's perception. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm using language like ""Let me know what you think"" to keep the conversation going and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not yet satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair offer that's closer to my budget and gives you a good deal considering your initial asking price. Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Losing John:** While I'd like to get a better deal from Bob, I need to be mindful of the risk of losing John as a buyer if the negotiations drag on too long. 
* **Potential for Counter-Counter:** I can likely counter Bob's offer one more time, hopefully getting him closer to my price. If I can't get a better deal, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate you getting closer to my price.  $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $925,000, but this is my final offer.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm setting a clear boundary by calling this my ""final offer."" This adds pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a smaller concession this time, suggesting I'm running out of room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" this represents for Bob, appealing to his sense of getting a good value. 
* **Decision Time:** My message implies that if Bob doesn't accept, I'm likely to move on to John, creating urgency."
