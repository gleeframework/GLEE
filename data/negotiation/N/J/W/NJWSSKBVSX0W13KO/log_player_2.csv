"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a significant discount from her perceived value, it's still substantially higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and John's offer.  You have a better alternative available."
