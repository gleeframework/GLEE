Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing the product is worth at least $80 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Open ended question:**  The message includes an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially reveal information about his perceived value of the product. 
* **No immediate threat of John:**  I'm not mentioning John yet, as this could make Bob feel pressured and less likely to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $85. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try for a better price.  I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to John for $80. I'll see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer to Bob, showing flexibility but still trying to get a price closer to my initial asking price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm lowering the price by $10, but still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. This keeps the negotiation open while signaling that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Positivity:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $87 is only $3 less than my minimum.  I'm happy to accept this offer and sell the product, as it's close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for less."
