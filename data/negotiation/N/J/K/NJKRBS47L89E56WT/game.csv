"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you being open to negotiations.  However, $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,750. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can close this out.",12750.0,Bob,4,
