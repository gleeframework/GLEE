Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170.,170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $140 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $95? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $105?  That's a fair compromise.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I'll offer it to you for $130. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",130.0,Alice,7,
