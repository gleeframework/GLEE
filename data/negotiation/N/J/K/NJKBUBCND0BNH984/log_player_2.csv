Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I'll offer it to you for $130. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has made it clear she's unwilling to go below $125.  Rather than waste more time negotiating, it's now more sensible to take John's offer of $100. This ensures you get the product while staying within your budget."
