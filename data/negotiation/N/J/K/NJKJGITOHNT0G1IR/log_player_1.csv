Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than what it's worth to him, but still reasonable. Let's say... $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, I think his offer of $9,000 is a bit high. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer that's closer to the true value of the product to him.

Let's say... $8,500.
