Round 5

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

At this point, Alice has met your alternative option of buying from John. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and there's no point in risking losing the deal for a potentially insignificant discount."
