(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it's still lower than the value I place on the product. Since I want to earn as much as I can, I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer.
