I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $1,000,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I have 9 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob has been stubborn and we're getting very close to my minimum price.  At this point, it's clear that I'm not going to get a better offer from Bob, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000.  It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
