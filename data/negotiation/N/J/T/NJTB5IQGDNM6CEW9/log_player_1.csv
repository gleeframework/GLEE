"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While I could sell to John now for $1,000,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my target of $1,150,000 or more.  I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident the product's value to you warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I can't go lower than that. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,050,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is better than selling to John for $1,000,000. There are only 6 rounds remaining, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer."
