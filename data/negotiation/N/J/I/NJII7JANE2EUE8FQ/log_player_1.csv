Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product because she has a guaranteed sale at that price from John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't want to pay more.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave Bob with a small incentive to buy. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,550,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its potential."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Why This Might Work**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price above Bob's valuation sets a strong anchor. While he may initially hesitate, it creates the perception of the product's high value.
* **Slight Margin:** The $50,000 markup is significant, but not outrageous enough to deter Bob completely, especially if he perceives the product as valuable.
* **Confident Tone:**  Phrases like ""fair price"" and ""confident"" project value and might nudge Bob towards accepting.

**Important Notes**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading Alice to sell at her bottom line to John. However, the potential for an extra $50,000 is a calculated risk worth taking.
* **Negotiation:** This offer assumes a one-shot negotiation. In reality, there could be back-and-forth between Alice and Bob."
