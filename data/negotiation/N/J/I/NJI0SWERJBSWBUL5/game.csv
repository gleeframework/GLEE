"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something truly special, and I believe it could be a game-changer for you. My initial price is $1500000.

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is there any flexibility on your end to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1200000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to come down to $1350000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you think of a compromise?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. I'm prepared to make one final concession. I'm willing to drop the price to $1300000. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1300000, so I'm offering $1250000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
