"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a decent price, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a reasonable starting point,  offering a price that is a significant reduction from Alice's offer while still being a potentially acceptable price for her given the product's value to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000.  That's still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,750 for the product. This is my best offer, and it represents a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer further demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while staying within your budget. It's a small but significant step closer to your target price, and it leaves room for Alice to accept while still achieving a decent sale price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'll come down to $10,900. This is a good price for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still over your maximum of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal or if you should go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there. I'm ready to pay $10,800 for the product. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's only $100 over your target price of $10,000, showing you're serious about the deal. It also gives Alice a chance to accept, making a small profit and closing the deal.  

Since this is the 6th round, we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation. It's a good time to make a final offer and see if Alice is willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but it's still a bit lower than I'd like.  I'm willing to go down to $10,850, but that's my absolute final price.  Let's make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting very close to your target price, it's still $850 over your budget.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  You have a guaranteed deal with John at $10,000, which is within your budget.  It's time to take the safer option and buy from John."
