"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's still a great price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can make this work.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see you're getting closer to my asking price.  While $140 is still a little low, I'm willing to compromise further.  How about we settle on $145?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without losing out.",145.0,Alice,5,
