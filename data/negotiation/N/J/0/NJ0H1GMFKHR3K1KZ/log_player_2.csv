{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $900,000 saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* Even though you could potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice, the information provided doesn't suggest that option. 
* The prompt focuses on the immediate decision between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John."
