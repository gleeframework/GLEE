{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately closing the deal. It also establishes a clear starting point and allows Bob to see your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet the price at $1,150,000. I would like to propose a final offer of $1,125,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $1,125,000 is still below my minimum, it's getting closer. Considering the risk of Bob walking away entirely and the certainty of selling to John for $1,500,000, it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
