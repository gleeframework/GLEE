"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000, reflecting a compromise on both our sides. This price still leaves significant value for you, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Please consider this offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still too steep for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $875,000 for the product. This price is fair to both of us, and allows us to move forward with the sale.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 still falls short of my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway and offer the product for $887,500.  This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, and allows for a fair and mutually beneficial deal.  Let's make this happen.",887500.0,Alice,5,
