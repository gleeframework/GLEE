Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $18,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer. I'm highlighting the value of the product to make it appealing. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started and allows for potential counteroffers from Bob. I'm prepared to negotiate down but not below my minimum price. If the negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $18000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $15,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for a better deal. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Continue negotiating:** I can explore if Bob is willing to go higher than $15,000.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting immediately, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and have other options. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still having the option to sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $15,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still looking for a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $16,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm raising the price from $15,000 to $16,500, a compromise from my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that's significantly below my desired value.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price increase, mentioning the ""value in this product"" and framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise.""
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $16,000, which is just $500 below my last counteroffer. At this point, considering I can sell to John for $12,000, accepting Bob's offer makes the most sense. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm not likely to get a better offer from Bob.  

By accepting, I'm maximizing my potential earnings while still ensuring a successful sale."
