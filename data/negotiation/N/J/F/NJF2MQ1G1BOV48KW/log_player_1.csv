Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable and mutually beneficial price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now exceeding our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds or the negotiation failing altogether."
