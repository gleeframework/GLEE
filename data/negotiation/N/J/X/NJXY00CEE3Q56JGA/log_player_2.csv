"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price of $950,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its true value to you is $1,000,000.  I'm confident you'll find this offer compelling, but if you decline, I've already secured a buyer willing to pay $800,000. Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is cheaper than John's price of $1,000,000.
* **You still save money:** Even though you're paying more than Alice's valuation of $800,000, you are still getting the product for less than your own valuation of $1,000,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
