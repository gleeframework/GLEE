Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,225,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,225,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. Let's try $1,275,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, to $1,200,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but I'm also getting closer to considering selling to John if I can't close a deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $1,200,000 is a good offer, and I'm getting closer to accepting. How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000?  This feels like a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this now!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to $1,220,000. I'm confident we can make a deal at this price and both benefit from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm running out of time and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  Selling to John ensures I get at least my minimum goal and I don't risk losing the sale completely."
