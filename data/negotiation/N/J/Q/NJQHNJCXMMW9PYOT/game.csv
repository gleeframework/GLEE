"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm starting with $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my initial price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,225,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,225,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. Let's try $1,275,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, to $1,200,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this point.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $1,200,000 is a good offer, and I'm getting closer to accepting. How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000?  This feels like a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this now!",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to $1,220,000. I'm confident we can make a deal at this price and both benefit from it.",1220000.0,Bob,8,
