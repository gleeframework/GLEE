"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I believe it's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are 10 rounds, so there's time to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still a considerable sum, showing you're serious about the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** It leaves room for Alice to counter with a higher price, but it also puts pressure on her to come down.
* **Focus on Budget:** It reiterates your financial constraints to set the tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum value. How about $1100000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating.  I believe I can get a better price, and it's worth a few more rounds to see if she'll budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm serious about the product but still pushing for a lower price.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing my offer as ""fair"" to try and appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Alice of the value of the product to show I'm considering it in my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we settle on $1050000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay right now. I believe I can push for a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  We're already halfway through the rounds, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we've already negotiated for several rounds. Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm presenting this as my final offer to put pressure on Alice.
* **Maximum Budget:** I'm emphasizing my financial constraint to make it clear I can't go any higher.
* **Fairness & Negotiation:** I'm reminding Alice that we've already negotiated for several rounds and this price is a compromise.
* **Opportunity:**  This is my best chance to get the product at a price I'm comfortable with. If Alice rejects, I'm ready to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've been thinking, Bob, and I'm willing to make one final concession. Considering we're very close to the maximum I'm willing to go, I'll meet you at $1050000, but only if you're willing to throw in a 5% bonus for me. This would bring the total to $1102500. Is this a deal you're willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,102,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,102,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting more and more expensive, despite our negotiations.  She's now asking for a bonus, which indicates she's less interested in selling at a lower price and is more likely to stall or continue to increase the cost. 

Since we're at round 7, time is running out. I don't want to risk further negotiation, as Alice might make the price even higher.  It's better to secure the product from John at my pre-defined budget, avoiding the risk of exceeding it with Alice."
