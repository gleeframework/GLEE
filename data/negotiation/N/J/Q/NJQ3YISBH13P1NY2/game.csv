"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects the true value and potential it holds.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,300,000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's still within my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  To be candid, $1,200,000 is below what I can consider. Let's settle this right now â€“ I'm prepared to make a significant move to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your position. ",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. It's a significant increase from my last offer and shows my good faith in wanting to reach a deal. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
