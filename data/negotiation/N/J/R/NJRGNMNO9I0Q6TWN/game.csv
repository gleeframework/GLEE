"Alice, your initial price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product is worth significantly more than that.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
