{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to open up the conversation and gauge Bob's interest. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  A $175 sale is significantly better than selling to John for $150.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  I can adjust my price based on Bob's response.
* **Avoid a stalemate:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can still negotiate further or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $100.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, his message shows he's genuinely interested in the product. This indicates there's room for further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:**  While John's offer is safe, I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Show I'm serious about getting a fair price:** This demonstrates my commitment to negotiating.
* **Maintain leverage:** I can now make a counteroffer that reflects a more acceptable price for me. 
* **Explore a potential deal:** There's still a chance to reach an agreement with Bob that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $135.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to where I need to be.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I'm emphasizing that $135 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the value of the product.
* **Keeping the Conversation Open:**  I'm using a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially accept my offer.

This strategy:

* **Increases the chances of a deal:**  A counteroffer shows flexibility and encourages further negotiation.
* **Maintains a reasonable profit margin:** $135 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoids potentially losing the sale:**  By continuing to negotiate, I can avoid selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result:**  While Bob is willing to negotiate, he's not showing a willingness to come closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer guarantees a safe and acceptable profit:** Selling to John for $150 ensures I meet my minimum price requirement and avoids further negotiation.

By choosing to sell to John, I:

* **Minimize risk:** I can secure a sale at a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might not lead to a better outcome.
* **Save time and effort:**  Selling to John allows me to move on to other opportunities."
