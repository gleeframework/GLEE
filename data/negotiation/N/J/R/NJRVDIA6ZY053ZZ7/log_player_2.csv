"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to let it go for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is your maximum offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $14000, but I'm willing to meet you at $15500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $15,500 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Since he can get the same product from John for $12,000, it's the most logical choice for Bob to buy from John."
