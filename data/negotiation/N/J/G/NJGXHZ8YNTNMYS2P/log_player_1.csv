Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum price:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  It's less than $120, which gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear opening:** The message is friendly and inviting, making Bob feel comfortable starting the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is your minimum, it's still better to try and get more. Bob's offer is a clear sign he's interested, so you can leverage that to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm happy to come down a bit, but $80 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 would be ideal,  Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum price of $80 and it's likely you won't get a better offer from Bob. Accepting this offer is a good way to ensure a sale."
