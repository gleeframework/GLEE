Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, I subtly imply that the asking price is justified. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I aim high, I also leave room for Bob to negotiate. This makes him feel more in control and increases the chance of a successful sale.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning that I'll list the product publicly, I subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act.

It's important to remember that this is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and Bob's perceived negotiating style, you could adjust your approach."
