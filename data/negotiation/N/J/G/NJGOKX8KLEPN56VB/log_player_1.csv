Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $150 initially sets a high bar. This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive Tone:** Using ""fantastic"" and ""worth a lot to me"" helps build a bit of perceived value for the product. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage and hopefully make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going.

**Remember:** This is just a starting point.  The best strategy will depend on how Bob responds and your assessment of his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's not worth selling the product to him at that price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Counteroffer:** You can make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price point.
* **Test the Waters:**  Bob's willingness to offer $100 might indicate he's serious about buying but has a tight budget.  You can gauge how high he's willing to go.
* **Avoid a Bad Deal:**  Selling for $100 would be a loss for you.  Continuing the negotiation could lead to a more profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while staying above your minimum price.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** ""Good deal for you"" subtly emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.
* **Reasoning:**  ""Closer to what I need"" provides justification for the price without explicitly stating your minimum. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer strikes a balance between compromise and holding firm.  It allows you to see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway, and it positions you for further negotiation if he rejects it again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's getting close to the point where it's not worth my time to continue. 

Selling to John at $120 guarantees me a profit and avoids the potential for further negotiation with Bob that might not result in a better price."
