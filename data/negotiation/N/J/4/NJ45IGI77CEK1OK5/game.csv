"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I know it holds great value for you as well.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price.  While $900,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's try to find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product for me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
