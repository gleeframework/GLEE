"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $900,000.  This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum goal of $800,000.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum goal of $800,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum goal.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob keeps lowering the price. While I'm getting impatient, $725,000 is still too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum price point with this offer. If Bob rejects this, I'm getting ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had enough. Bob is not negotiating in good faith and is just trying to get a bargain.  I'm going to take John's offer of $800,000, which is my minimum, and move on."
