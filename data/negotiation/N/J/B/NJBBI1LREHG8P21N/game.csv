"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while my ideal price is above your initial valuation, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. To start, I propose a price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am still looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is below the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? This reflects my willingness to be flexible while acknowledging the value this brings to the table.",1110000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I sense we're getting closer. While $1,080,000 is still below my desired outcome, I'm prepared to bridge the gap significantly.  How about $1,100,000?  This is a very competitive offer considering its worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, my previous offer of $1,100,000 is already quite aggressive given the value this product offers. I'm willing to stand by that price for now, but need to see some movement on your end to justify continuing our discussions.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
