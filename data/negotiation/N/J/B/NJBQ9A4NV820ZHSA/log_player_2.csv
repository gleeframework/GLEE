"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'll find extremely valuable. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($800,000).  
* **You have room to negotiate.**  Since you have a backup option with John, you can try to get a better price from Alice. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate.** By rejecting, you show Alice that you're serious about getting a better deal, potentially leading to a counter-offer closer to your ideal price."
