``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiating, I won't accept such a low price right away. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product highly valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, which would be $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that's significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident you won't regret this purchase.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
