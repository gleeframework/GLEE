"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the product's value to entice Bob.
* **First Offer:** This first offer shows I'm serious about making a deal with Bob, but also sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  I still have room to negotiate with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** By continuing to negotiate, I may be able to secure a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Splitting the Difference:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still securing a price above my minimum threshold. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I really think $1,250,000 is still too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go to $1,150,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I still have 6 rounds left, so there's time to continue negotiating with Bob.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob seems willing to negotiate, so there's a chance he may raise his offer further. 
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always choose to sell to John for $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $1,150,000 is still too low. I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair compromise that leaves us both satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising Again:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer ($1,250,000) and his offer ($1,150,000).
* **Fair Compromise:** I emphasize that this offer is a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, but getting closer to a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle anytime soon. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to pay more than that. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has clearly stated his final offer, and it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in round 6, and I have limited time remaining to close a deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is well above what I would get from Bob's final offer.  
* **Risk of Losing More:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate, I risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all.

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
