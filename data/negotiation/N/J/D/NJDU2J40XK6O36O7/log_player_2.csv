"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $10,000, which is still more than Bob wants to pay.
* **John's Offer:** $12,000, which is Bob's upper limit.

**Strategy:**  Reject Alice's offer and see if she's willing to come down in price. There are still 9 rounds left, so Bob has time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Maximize savings while still securing a deal.
* **Alice's Offer:** $10,000, which is above Bob's desired price point. 
* **John's Offer:**  $12,000, a constant reminder that Bob can walk away.

**Strategy:**  A counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,500, which is closer to Bob's desired price point and within his budget.
* **John's Offer:** $12,000, which is a much higher price.

**Strategy:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this round. Bob saves $500 compared to buying from John, and it's likely Alice won't go lower given her previous counteroffer. This strategy prioritizes securing a deal at a reasonable price rather than potentially risking losing a deal by continuing to haggle."
