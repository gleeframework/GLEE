"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I really think that's a fair price for both of us.,105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
