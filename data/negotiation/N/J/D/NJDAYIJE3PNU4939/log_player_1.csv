{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $80, giving him some room to negotiate, but still leaves a significant profit margin for me.  I've chosen a price that is close to my minimum desired price point, which allows me to gauge his interest without immediately resorting to my backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I really think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
