"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8500 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  This would still give you a good deal and allow me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
