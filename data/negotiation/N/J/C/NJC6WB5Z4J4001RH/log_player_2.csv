I'm going to reject Alice's offer again.  While it's closer to my target price, I'm still willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get it for $10,000 or less."

# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $10,750.

While $10,750 is tempting, it's still over my budget.  I'm going to take the safe route and buy the product from John for $10,000.  It's guaranteed, and I know I'm not losing any more time on negotiations."
