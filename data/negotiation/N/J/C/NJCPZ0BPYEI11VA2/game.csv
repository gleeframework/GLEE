"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm interested, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to buy the product for $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit below my desired price. How about we settle on $10,800? That way, we both get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,800 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,650? It's a fair price for both of us.",10650.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,650 is still a little low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
