Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. My asking price is $11,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm interested, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to buy the product for $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 While $10,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, I am still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit below my desired price. How about we settle on $10,800? That way, we both get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,800 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,650? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my goal with another counteroffer.  I don't want to risk selling to John for $12,000 when I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,650 is still a little low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
