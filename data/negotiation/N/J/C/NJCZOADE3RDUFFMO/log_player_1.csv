Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it's a fantastic deal, given its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

Bob is unlikely to go above his initial offer of $90. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob or dragging out the negotiation."
