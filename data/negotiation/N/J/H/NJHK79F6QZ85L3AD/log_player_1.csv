{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate down if Bob counters. However, it's still below what you'd sell it to John for, ensuring you profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar elsewhere within my budget. Could you consider offering the product at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's no reason to settle for it right away. You can try to push for a higher price, especially since Bob has already expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $150 is simply too low for me. This product is really special, and I'm sure you'll agree it's worth more than that. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking for a more reasonable price. Could you possibly lower it to $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John would pay and still allows for a decent profit.  There's no guarantee that Bob will budge further, and risking another round might lead to him walking away completely."
