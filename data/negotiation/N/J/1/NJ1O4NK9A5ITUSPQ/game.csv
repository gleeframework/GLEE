"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  It's a fair price considering our previous negotiations and my budget.  Let's see if we can finally strike a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
