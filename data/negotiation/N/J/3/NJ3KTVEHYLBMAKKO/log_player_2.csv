(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

It's always good to try and get a better price, and $1,100,000 is still a significant saving.  Let's see if we can negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

Let's start by offering Alice $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from her original offer, but it still allows for some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a good price. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject any lower offer and we'll have to buy from John at a higher price.  It's time to accept and secure the product."
