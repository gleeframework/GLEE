"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,250,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects the value while working within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
