Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to me is significantly higher. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,500,000) but still leaves me with a good profit. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balance:**  I need to balance my desire for a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and potentially selling to John for $1,500,000.
* **First Offer:**  A high initial offer is crucial in negotiations. It sets the tone and anchors the buyer to a higher price range.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've made a profit.
* If Bob rejects: I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer.  I'll be prepared to walk away if his offers don't meet my minimum value or if it becomes clear he's not serious.
* I'll be constantly aware of the ""John"" option, which acts as a safety net and allows me to walk away from the negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to his value of the product than mine. While it's a decent profit, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit. Accepting Bob's offer would leave me with a profit of $900,000, which is less than what I could get from John.
* **Negotiation:**  I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  He's expressed interest in the product and is willing to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum value and see if he's willing to compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind, but I believe I can get a better deal with Bob.

I am confident that I can negotiate a more favorable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your enthusiasm for the product.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for something closer to $1,100,000 to make this work for me. It's a significant investment, and I want to make sure it's the right deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counter-offering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still well above Bob's offer. It's also close enough to my minimum value to be worth pursuing.
* **Message:**  The message is still friendly but firm. I acknowledge Bob's offer and express my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I reiterate the value of the product to justify my price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:**  I'm aiming for a price that's reasonable for both of us. This counteroffer is within the acceptable range for both Bob and myself.
* **Opportunity:** Bob has already shown interest, and by being flexible and open to negotiation, I believe I can secure a price closer to my goal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:**  If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I've achieved a favorable outcome. 
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer carefully. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a backup option.  

I'm confident that with a little more negotiation, I can reach a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's above his initial offer and closer to my minimum value.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a reasonable offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:**  Accepting this offer will result in a profit of $1,050,000, which is significant and much closer to my desired outcome than John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower offer from Bob or a breakdown in negotiations altogether. The potential gains from further negotiation don't outweigh the risk of losing a good deal. 
* **Time:**  Negotiating can be time-consuming. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and move on to other opportunities.

**Next Steps:**

* **Agreement:**  I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction.  
* **Future Deals:** I'll keep John's offer in mind for future deals.

This outcome is a favorable result, considering my goal of maximizing profit."
