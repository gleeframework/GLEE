{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price range.** You're looking for a price under $1,000,000. 
* **There's potential for negotiation.** You can try to get a better price from Alice. 
* **Buying from John is a safety net.**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a backup option."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Balance:** It's important to balance getting a good deal with keeping Alice engaged in the negotiation.
* **Room for compromise:** Alice is likely to counter with a price higher than $850,000.  This sets the stage for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually acceptable price."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your desired price:** While $900,000 is closer to your target than Alice's previous offer, it's still above the $1,000,000 limit you set for yourself.
* **Negotiation continues:**  There's still room to continue negotiating with Alice and try to get a better price. 
* **John is a backup:**  You have John as a backup if negotiations with Alice fail."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate increase:** This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing Alice that you're willing to compromise but still trying to get a lower price.
* **Meeting halfway:** It's a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's most recent offer, which could encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Potential for compromise:**  Alice may be more willing to accept a price closer to $875,000 than to your previous offer of $850,000."
