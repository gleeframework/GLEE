Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum value. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price with a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $105, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to sell for $105 and avoid further negotiation, I'm still holding out hope that I can get closer to my desired price.  It's worth risking another round to see if I can push Bob a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $105 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $110 for this product.  Let's compromise and meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $105. I'm willing to make a final offer: $104.50. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $104.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $104.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting frustrating to negotiate with Bob, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I'd love to get a slightly better price, I'm not confident that Bob will budge anymore. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and with limited rounds left, it's the safest choice."
