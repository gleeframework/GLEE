"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This would give us both a fair deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your initial offer is a bit lower than I had in mind, I'm willing to come down a bit to find a mutually agreeable price. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow us to move forward.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I respect that. Let's try to wrap this up quickly.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
