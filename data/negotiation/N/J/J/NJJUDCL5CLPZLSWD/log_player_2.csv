Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,350,000?  This price still represents a great value for you, and I believe we can finalize this deal.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially negotiate further, the price is now within his budget and  he runs the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer or him needing to buy from John."
