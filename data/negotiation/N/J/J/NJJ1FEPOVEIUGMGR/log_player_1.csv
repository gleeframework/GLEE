Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and using positive language to encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer is a starting point. If Bob rejects, I'll use his counteroffer to gauge his willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* I'll keep John's offer in mind, as it represents my minimum acceptable price.  
* I'll aim to reach a price as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible while ensuring Bob is still willing to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob is clearly interested in the product. 
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John at $15,000 guarantees a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll consider his willingness to pay and try to find a middle ground.
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net. 
* The goal is to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open."
