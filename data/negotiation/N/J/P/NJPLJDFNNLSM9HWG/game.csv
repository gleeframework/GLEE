"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $90 for it, but I can't go any higher.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $95. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. ",95.0,Bob,4,
