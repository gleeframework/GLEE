"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,150,000. It's a great opportunity for you to get something worth $1,200,000 to you at a significant discount.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount you're providing. I would like to counter with an offer of $1100000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal.  Selling to John would be a last resort if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you, and gets us closer to a deal. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to counter with an offer of $1110000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,110,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  It's a good sign that Bob is getting closer, but I have 6 more rounds to continue negotiations.  Selling to John at this point would be premature, as there's still room for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the sense we're both committed to making this happen. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,115,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1115000}
