"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming for the highest possible price. Starting significantly above Bob's perceived value gives us room for negotiation while anchoring the price high in his mind. 
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence about the product's value is crucial in negotiations. 
* **Leaving Room:** While we want a high price, we don't want to discourage Bob completely. This initial offer leaves significant room for negotiation and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given my budget constraints and the product's value to me, I'm offering $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price, reflecting both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While his counteroffer is a slight increase from his perceived value, we have ample room for negotiation and time before considering selling to John. Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product and the potential return on investment it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  We're making a substantial decrease from our initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but not drastically. This keeps the price well above Bob's offer, aiming for a middle ground closer to our target.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's value and potential ROI to justify the high price and shift Bob's focus from his perceived value.
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  While compromising, we're maintaining a firm stance that Bob's offer is unacceptable. Our language (""significant compromise"") underscores this while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,950,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's continue to work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is increasing, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price and our fallback option of selling to John. We're not yet in a time-sensitive situation, so we'll continue negotiating to explore if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To show my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,700,000. I believe this reflects a fair balance between its value and our respective positions."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** Acknowledging Bob's movement creates a positive atmosphere and encourages further negotiation.
* **Strategic Reduction:**  We're lowering our price by a significant amount ($250,000) to signal flexibility while still staying well above Bob's offers and our guaranteed sale price. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting our willingness to close the deal and reiterating a sense of fairness can make this price more appealing to Bob.
* **Time Consideration:**  As we're approaching the halfway point in the rounds,  applying a bit more pressure with a substantial reduction might encourage Bob to move closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably spend. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000.  This price represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum, Above John:** Bob's offer is getting closer to our guaranteed price with John ($1,500,000), but it's still under our desired minimum.  
* **Strategic Holdout:**  We're getting a sense of Bob's upper limit, and it's likely that accepting at this point won't yield a significantly better offer from him.
* **Time Remaining:** We still have time to negotiate and try to push Bob closer to our target price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but we need to find a price point that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a substantial compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Pressure:**  We're stating this is our final offer to create urgency and encourage Bob to make a serious decision. 
* **Slightly Above John:** This price is just above our guaranteed sale price to John, leaving a small margin for potential profit if Bob agrees.
* **Firm but Fair:** We're acknowledging Bob's perspective but standing firm on a price that protects our interests.  
* **Time Limit Implicit:**  By not explicitly mentioning further negotiation, we're subtly implying a time constraint, pushing Bob towards a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort, but $1,550,000 remains out of my budget. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm offering $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it.  We both know the product is valuable, and I believe this price reflects a fair balance between our respective needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadlock Likely:**  Both we and Bob have presented our ""final offers."" It's highly unlikely Bob will significantly increase his price, and we're unwilling to go below our last offer.
* **John as Guarantee:**  We have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000. This price is better than Bob's ""final offer.""
* **Time Optimization:**  While we have rounds left, prolonging the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better outcome than our existing option with John. Selling to John allows us to secure the best price without further risk or delay."
