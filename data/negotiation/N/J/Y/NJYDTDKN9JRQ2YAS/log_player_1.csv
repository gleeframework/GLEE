Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you're interested in, for $145. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($150) without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $145 is my starting point,  there's a chance Bob might negotiate for a slightly lower price. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down a little, selling at $145 is significantly better than my alternative option of selling to John for $120."
