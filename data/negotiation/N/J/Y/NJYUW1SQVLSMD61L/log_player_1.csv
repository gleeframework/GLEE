Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I believe I can still get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still keeping it above my minimum. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate while also showing that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum and I don't think I can get a better price from him. While I would prefer to sell it for more, I can guarantee myself $10,000 by selling to John."
