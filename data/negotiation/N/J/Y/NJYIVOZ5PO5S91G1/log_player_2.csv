"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,250, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment. How about we do $8,375? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a bit of a concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely we'll get Alice much lower than this, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing her away completely.  This price is a good compromise and saves a significant amount compared to John's offer."
