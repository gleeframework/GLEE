Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $1,250,000?  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,125,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not quite there. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob up to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,162,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make."", ""product_price"": 1162500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we need to find a compromise. Your last offer is a bit too high for me. I can do $1,143,750. This keeps us close to the middle ground and feels like a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,143,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,143,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,143,750.  It's a bit below my ideal price, but it's a good deal considering the time we've spent negotiating and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
