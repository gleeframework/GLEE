"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $9,000 is over your budget and it's worth trying to get closer to your target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $8,500 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,750.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, $8,750 is still above my target of $8,000. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get the price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,625?  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8625}
