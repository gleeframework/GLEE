"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $8,500 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,750.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,625?  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",8625.0,Bob,4,
