"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your position, but $6,000 is quite low for the value this product offers. Could we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $7,500.  Would you consider $10,000? This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
