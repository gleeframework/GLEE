Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $120. It's a fantastic deal!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, providing a positive spin like ""fantastic deal"" can pique Bob's interest and make him consider the offer more seriously. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both my minimum price ($80) and his own perceived value of the product ($80). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's clear we have room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price and open the door for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is quite low. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've significantly lowered my asking price from $120 to $95, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:**  By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair solution that considers both our positions.  
* **Profitable:** This price point is still well above my minimum ($80) and allows me to make a decent profit.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to engage in more reasonable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate, his offer of $75 is still below my absolute minimum of $80.  At this point, the potential gains from continuing the negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the risk of him not reaching my minimum price. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $80, which meets my needs. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure a sure sale."
