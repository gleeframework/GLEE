"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120:** This is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $150 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the value proposition of the deal for Bob. 

I'm aiming for a quick agreement, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:**  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target. 
* **Reasoning:** I have 10 rounds, and I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob.  Selling to John for $150 is always an option, but I want to explore all possibilities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$105:**  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging his offer while emphasizing the value for him and the need for a price closer to my own.  

This round is about finding a middle ground while maintaining a sense of fairness and continuing the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:** While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I have 6 rounds left and believe I can potentially get a better deal. 
* **Reasoning:** Selling to John is always an option, but I'm determined to see if I can reach a more favorable agreement with Bob.  The gap is closing, and I want to continue exploring options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to drop the price to $100.  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100:**  This offer is a direct midpoint between my last offer ($105) and Bob's latest offer ($95). It signals my willingness to meet halfway and find a solution.
* **Message:**  I'm using the phrase ""split the difference"" to emphasize the fairness and compromise in my offer. I'm also reiterating the benefit of closing the deal for both of us. 

I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if he rejects it, I'll need to reconsider my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $92 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:**  The negotiation has reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm starting to run out of time. With only four rounds left, it's not guaranteed that we can reach an agreement.  To ensure I get at least my minimum desired price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John. 
* **Reasoning:** While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, the risk of getting a lower price or not reaching an agreement in the remaining rounds is too high.  It's better to guarantee a sale at $150, which is a satisfactory outcome for me."
