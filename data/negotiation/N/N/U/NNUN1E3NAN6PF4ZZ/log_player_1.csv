Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price point for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower starting point ($11,500) leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** The offer is still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($10,000), ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates a slightly lower price."
