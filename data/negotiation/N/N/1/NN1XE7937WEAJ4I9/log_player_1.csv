{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's something you'll find valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It also sets the tone that I'm confident in the value of the product.  However, I'm keeping the offer below the price John is willing to pay, giving me some wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is at my minimum, I don't want to settle immediately.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher, since I know I can get $12,000 from John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $12,000 just yet. The product is truly worth more, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12500, and I believe this is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good deal. It's above my minimum of $12,000 and  getting closer to my initial asking price. I'm happy to take this deal and move on."
