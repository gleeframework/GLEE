"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's something you'll find valuable. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $12000 just yet. The product is truly worth more, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12500, and I believe this is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,4,
