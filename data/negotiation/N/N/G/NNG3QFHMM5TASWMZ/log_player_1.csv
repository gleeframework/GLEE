Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum of $80.  Let's see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering with $110. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $100 is a reasonable offer.  It's still above my minimum and better than selling to John. I'll accept Bob's offer."
