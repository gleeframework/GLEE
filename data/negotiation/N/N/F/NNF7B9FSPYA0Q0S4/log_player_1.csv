Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances the value of the product with my budget constraints.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can push a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000. I believe this is the maximum I can afford and still get a good return on investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly trying to negotiate the best possible price, but his latest offer is still a substantial gain over John's $800,000. It's always tempting to try for more, but there's a risk Bob will walk away entirely. Accepting $1,175,000 secures a significant profit and avoids dragging out the negotiation further."
