"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $13,500. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as his interest in the product suggests there's room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $10,800? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is closer to my minimum, I believe we can still reach a more favorable price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target with further negotiation, as Bob has clearly shown interest. Selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on this deal with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $11,200? This price is closer to your last offer and still allows me to get a fair value for the product.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation, and I'm ready to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  How about $11,000? I feel this is a very fair price and shows how serious I am about buying this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $11,000, which is only $1,000 below my minimum.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer, as it's a good outcome considering the limited rounds left. While selling to John for $12,000 is still an option, it's likely that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a lower price."
