Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit high for me. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price than $85, and I have a few more rounds to work with.  If Bob doesn't come up a bit, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $90 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Let's split the difference - how about $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer for $87.50.  It's still a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $80."
