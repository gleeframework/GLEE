{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm getting closer to her desired price. However, it's still within my budget and leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable offer and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If she rejects, I'll be forced to consider my backup option with John."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

This is my final offer. I'm increasing my offer to $1,100,000, which is still significantly lower than Alice's current offer, but it shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.  It's a gamble, but I believe it's a fair price considering the limited time remaining. If Alice rejects, I'll have to purchase from John, but at least I'll know I tried my best to negotiate a good deal."
