"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about we consider a price of $1,100,000 for the product? This would still be a significant saving for me compared to other offers I've received.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,125,000 is still a bit too far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try $1,150,000. It's a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to move forward. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
