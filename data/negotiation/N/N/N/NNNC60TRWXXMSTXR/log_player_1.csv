Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $9000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
The product is worth $8,000 to me, and Bob is offering $7,500, so I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $8250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8000, my maximum limit. If you can accept that, we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob is offering my minimum price, and I'm not sure I can get more from him.  It's time to close the deal and move on."
