{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the price to make it seem more justifiable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language that indicates I'm open to negotiation (""Let me know your thoughts"").

This initial offer is a starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price, even if it means potentially missing out on a sale to him. I'll proceed to the next round and counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Considering the value of the product and its potential, I'm prepared to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to  get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Low Offer:** I'm making it clear that Bob's offer is unacceptable, but I'm still open to negotiation.
* **Midpoint Approach:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between our two initial offers, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value again to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using phrases like ""great deal"" to make the counteroffer seem appealing.

This counteroffer is more realistic while still protecting my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle of your last offer and my previous offer, at $950000? I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I'm willing to accept.  I'm not ready to sell at a loss. I'll continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  I believe I can still convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential it offers.  It's a compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Persistence:** I'm reiterating my position that Bob's offer is too low, but still showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum, showing I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and potential to justify the price.
* **Mutual Satisfaction:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario, emphasizing that it's a compromise that will make both of us happy. 

This counteroffer is a step towards a potential deal, but I'm prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to come up in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1100000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It seems that further negotiation with Bob won't lead to a price I'm comfortable with. To avoid losing out completely, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get my desired price and avoid taking a significant loss."
