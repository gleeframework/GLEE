"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Considering the value of the product and its potential, I'm prepared to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $1300000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to  get closer to my desired price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle of your last offer and my previous offer, at $950000? I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential it offers.  It's a compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1100000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",900000.0,Bob,6,
