"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
