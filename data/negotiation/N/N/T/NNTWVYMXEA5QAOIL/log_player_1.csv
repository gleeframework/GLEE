``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is within my minimum acceptable range but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm trying to build rapport with Bob and create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to me, implying it's worth more than I'm offering. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a win-win situation where I can get a good price, but Bob also feels he got a fair deal. I'm not going to give it away for $1,000,000, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
