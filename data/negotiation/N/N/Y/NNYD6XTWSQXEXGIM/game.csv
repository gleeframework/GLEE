"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $7,000.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make another adjustment, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm thinking of $8,500. This is my best compromise so far, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
