``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. It shows that you are willing to compromise while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While Bob's offer is below your minimum valuation, it's worth exploring if you can meet in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $115? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
