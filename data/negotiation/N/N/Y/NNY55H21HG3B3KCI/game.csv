"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'd be willing to offer $900,000 for it, given its worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering its worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
