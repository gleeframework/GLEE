Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of significant value to you. I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob, while still securing a price significantly higher than your fallback option (John's $10,000 offer).
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message implies the product's worth without being overly aggressive.  This approach aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a fair deal even if he doesn't negotiate down."
