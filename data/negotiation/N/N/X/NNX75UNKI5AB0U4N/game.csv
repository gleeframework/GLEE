"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
