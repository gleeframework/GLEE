Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's valuation and my minimum allows room for negotiation. It anchors the discussion around a higher number.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how eager he is to purchase and provide insight into his negotiation strategy. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have John willing to buy at $800,000 provides a strong fallback position, allowing me to be bolder in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated valuation. This suggests he's aiming for a very low price, hoping I'll undervalue the product.  I'll reject this low offer and counter to steer the negotiation closer to a more reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer, signaling flexibility, but I'm staying well above both my $800,000 floor and his potential $800,000 valuation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge if Bob is willing to negotiate in a more realistic price range. If he remains too low, I'll consider John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground. How about $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now negotiating in a more realistic range, his offer of $650,000 is still below my guaranteed $800,000 from John. I believe I can get Bob closer to my target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $850,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Advantageous:** I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between his last offer ($650,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,000,000).  This makes me appear flexible but keeps the price well above my guaranteed $800,000. 
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer aims to quickly move towards a deal. If Bob isn't receptive to this offer, I might consider John's offer to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $700,000 is closer to my target, it's still below John's guaranteed $800,000. At this point, the potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is minimal compared to the risk of him walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This is my final offer: $750,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear this is my last offer to signal the end of negotiations.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $750,000 is a compromise that is still above my guaranteed offer from John but might be enticing enough for Bob to close the deal.
* **Time for Decision:** This counteroffer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court, pushing for a final decision and avoiding prolonged back-and-forth."
