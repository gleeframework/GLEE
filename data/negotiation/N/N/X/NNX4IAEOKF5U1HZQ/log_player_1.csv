Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer ($100) because I want to maximize my profit.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** By saying ""open to negotiation"", I signal to Bob that I'm willing to compromise, which might encourage him to make a counteroffer.
* **Avoid being too aggressive:** If I start with an extremely high price, Bob might be immediately turned off and walk away. 
* **Show enthusiasm:** Expressing that I think Bob would ""really love"" the product helps build rapport and could make him more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. However, my budget allows me to spend no more than $80 on this product. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I could get from John ($100). It's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'd love to get closer to your offer,  $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  This would give me a better return on the product, and still save you $10 compared to my original offer."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's budget:** Showing understanding of Bob's limitations helps keep the negotiation positive.
* **Offer a compromise:**  $90 is a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of agreement.
* **Highlight the benefits for Bob:**  Mentioning the $10 saving compared to my original offer adds value to my counteroffer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Keeping the message friendly helps avoid any potential tension or negativity."
