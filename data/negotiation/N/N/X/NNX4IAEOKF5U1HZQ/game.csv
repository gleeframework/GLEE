"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. However, my budget allows me to spend no more than $80 on this product. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'd love to get closer to your offer,  $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  This would give me a better return on the product, and still save you $10 compared to my original offer.",90.0,Alice,3,
