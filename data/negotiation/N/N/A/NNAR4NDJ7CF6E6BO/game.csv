I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could meet you at $1,125,000.  This offer represents a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,125,000 is a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
