Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $10,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go below $11,000.  Since you can buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses in the negotiation with Alice and go with the guaranteed lower price."
