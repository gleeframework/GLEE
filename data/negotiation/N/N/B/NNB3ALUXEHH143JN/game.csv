"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we settle at $10,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
