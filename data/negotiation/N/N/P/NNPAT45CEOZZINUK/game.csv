"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you highlighting the product's unique features. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate the gesture, $12000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to go up to $9000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
