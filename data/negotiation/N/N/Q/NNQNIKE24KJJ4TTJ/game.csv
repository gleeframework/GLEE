"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
