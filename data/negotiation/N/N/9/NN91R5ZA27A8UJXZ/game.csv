"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.  Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
