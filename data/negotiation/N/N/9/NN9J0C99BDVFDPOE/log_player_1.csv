Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,300,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without overpaying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is consistently staying close to his initial offer. Accepting $1,350,000 ensures a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or me having to settle for John's offer in later rounds."
