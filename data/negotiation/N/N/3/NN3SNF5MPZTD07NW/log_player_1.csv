Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's attractive to both of us. It's higher than my minimum, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  It also avoids unnecessarily starting with a high price that could scare Bob off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get closer to $10,000. It's worth pushing for a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800. This is only slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but also that I still believe the product is worth a bit more. It keeps the negotiation moving while putting some pressure on Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my counteroffer and still significantly higher than selling to John. At this point, further negotiation risks losing the deal altogether.  $9,600 is a good outcome and minimizes the risk."
