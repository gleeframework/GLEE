"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. My asking price is $180.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $180, knowing it's above Bob's value but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a positive impression and encourage him to negotiate. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm aware that I can always drop the price in later rounds, so leaving room for a compromise is important."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I have multiple rounds to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I'm not yet desperate enough to sell at a loss. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $160?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's in between my minimum ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $120, hopefully making him reconsider. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** $160 is still a fair price for me, but I can go lower if needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $140.  This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident we can find a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might be forced to sell to John at $150.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to start securing a deal.  This offer is a good compromise."
