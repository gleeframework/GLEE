"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. My asking price is $180.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $180 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $120 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first, but he should always have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $160?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $160 is closer to his budget, it's still above his $120 limit, and he knows he can get the product for that price from John. He can counteroffer again, but should be prepared to buy from John if Alice won't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $140.  This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident we can find a deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
