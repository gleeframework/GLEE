Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly above her minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice leverage. She's not desperate to sell below that price."
