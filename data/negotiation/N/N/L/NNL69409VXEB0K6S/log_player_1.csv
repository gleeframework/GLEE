Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob values the product at $120, it's best to start with an offer above that to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for Bob to feel good about the deal:** Offering it at $135 allows Bob to potentially negotiate down a little and feel like he got a good price, even if it's slightly above his initial valuation.
* **Maximizing profit while ensuring a sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price of $150."
