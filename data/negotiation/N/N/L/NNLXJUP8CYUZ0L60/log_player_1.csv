Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to move closer to your number. How about we settle at $925,000?  This reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my number, but I'm still a bit far from where I'd like to be. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can you meet me at $875,000 or lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly very interested and sees the value.  While his offer is getting close to my fallback, I still have room to negotiate and I'm aiming to get as close to $900,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I respect that. Let's make this simple: I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal given the product's true value."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** By now, we've established a clear pattern of back-and-forth. Bob is unlikely to go above $900,000, and I'm better off securing that price than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer. This firm but fair final offer might be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has become entrenched at a price significantly lower than my target and even my fallback. His ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to budge. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $800,000 rather than risking further negotiation for a smaller potential gain."
