"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product.",1125000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,875,000. This price reflects the true value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
