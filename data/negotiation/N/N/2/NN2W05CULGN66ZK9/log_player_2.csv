"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you! I'm offering you a unique product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget and you know John will sell it for less.  It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
