"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible. While I do like the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you really want this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $9,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? That would be a fair price for both of us. ",8250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
