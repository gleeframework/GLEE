Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,000,000, getting Bob to pay close to that amount maximizes our potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) and positions it as a premium deal while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
