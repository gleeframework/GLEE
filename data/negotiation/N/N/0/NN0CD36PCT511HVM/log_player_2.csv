"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Since you are willing to pay $15,000, and Alice is offering the same price, there is no benefit to negotiating.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at your maximum price."
