{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a lower offer than Alice's, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. He sets a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This allows for room for further negotiation while also showing Bob's seriousness in closing the deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Bob has 7 rounds remaining, and he can potentially get a better deal. It's worth exploring further negotiation to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's offer of $15,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, or he may not be able to secure a lower price in the remaining rounds. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without jeopardizing the deal."
