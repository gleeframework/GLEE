Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not worth it to me right now. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree.  $975,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down just a bit more, but I'm sticking to $1,025,000.  If this isn't acceptable, I'm going to have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
