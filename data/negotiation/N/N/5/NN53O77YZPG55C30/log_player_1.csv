"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate. But I'll also be keeping an eye on John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profitable deal.  $1,200,000 is a good compromise, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway.  I'll continue to evaluate John's offer as a backup, but I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll be keeping a close eye on John's offer. I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can still secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm willing to come down further, but $1,100,000 is still a reasonable price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize this as a fair compromise and accept my offer.  However, I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup plan.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000, so if Bob rejects this offer, I may need to move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$950,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have 4 rounds left and I don't want to rush into a deal that's not quite ideal. I'm going to make another counteroffer, but I'll also be more seriously considering selling to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to secure a better price.  $1,050,000 is a fair compromise, and I believe Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway. I only have 3 rounds left, so I'm starting to feel the pressure. If Bob rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John, but I'm still holding out hope for a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky one.  While I'd love to get more, Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  With only two rounds left, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. It's time to accept and move on."
