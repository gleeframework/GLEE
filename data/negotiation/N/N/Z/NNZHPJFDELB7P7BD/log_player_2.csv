Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to know you're serious about the deal. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can make a deal happen.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $12,250.  That's a very fair offer considering John is offering me the same product for $12,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12250}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I've already compromised a lot to get to this point. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which is a $1,000 value. I'm still firm at $13,000, but I think the extras make it a much better deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While the extras are a nice touch, they don't change the fact that I can get the product for $12,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
