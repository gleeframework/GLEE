Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $10,000 to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm still a ways off from being comfortable with that price. How about we try $11,500?  That's a significant step from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $12,250.  That's a very fair offer considering John is offering me the same product for $12,000. What do you say?

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I've already compromised a lot to get to this point. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which is a $1,000 value. I'm still firm at $13,000, but I think the extras make it a much better deal for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
