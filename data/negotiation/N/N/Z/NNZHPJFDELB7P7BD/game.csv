"I'm excited to offer you this great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $10,000 to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000, but I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm still a ways off from being comfortable with that price. How about we try $11,500?  That's a significant step from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to know you're serious about the deal. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can make a deal happen.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $12,250.  That's a very fair offer considering John is offering me the same product for $12,000. What do you say?",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I've already compromised a lot to get to this point. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which is a $1,000 value. I'm still firm at $13,000, but I think the extras make it a much better deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,7,
