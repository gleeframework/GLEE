"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I think $20,000 is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? This way, we both feel like we're getting a fair deal.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,500 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $16,250? It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",16250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're driving a hard bargain! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this - let's do $16,800 and call it a deal? That's my final offer.",16800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $16,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  If we can agree on $16,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,6,
