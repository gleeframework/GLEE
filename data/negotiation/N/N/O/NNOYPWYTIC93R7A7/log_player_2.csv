"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I think $20,000 is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? This way, we both feel like we're getting a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. He's willing to negotiate further and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,500 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $16,250? It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 16250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're driving a hard bargain! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this - let's do $16,800 and call it a deal? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget of $15,000.  He has the option to buy from John at his target price, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $16,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  If we can agree on $16,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
