{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a reason for Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $120, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counter with a lower price, but one that's still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $130 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to go lower, so I'll sell the product to John for $150."
