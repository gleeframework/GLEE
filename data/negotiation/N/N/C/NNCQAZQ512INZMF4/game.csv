"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping we can find a compromise closer to $10,000. How about $9,500? This would still give you a good deal and would be more beneficial for me.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to go too far above my budget. What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,4,
