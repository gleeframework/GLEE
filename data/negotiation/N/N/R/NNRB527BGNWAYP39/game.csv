"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to consider my minimum price. I can do $11,500, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference between our previous offers and settle on $10,250? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $10,250 is still a bit lower than my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. I can tell this product means a lot to you, and I respect your need to make a fair profit. Let's settle this right now - how about $10,500? That's my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I can do $11,250, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's meet in the middle once more, but this is my final compromise.",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand this is important to both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $10,875.  This is my absolute best offer, and I think it's more than fair.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",10875.0,Bob,8,
