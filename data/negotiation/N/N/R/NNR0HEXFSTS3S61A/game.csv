"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,750 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference one more time? I'm willing to go down to $10,125. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's my final offer. I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",9900.0,Bob,6,
