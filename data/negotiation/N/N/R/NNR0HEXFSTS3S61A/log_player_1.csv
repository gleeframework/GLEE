Round 2

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,750 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference one more time? I'm willing to go down to $10,125. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's my final offer. I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,900 is a good deal for me, especially considering the limited number of rounds remaining.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
