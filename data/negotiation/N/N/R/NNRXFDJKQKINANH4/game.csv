"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but $9000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $10500. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try $9500. It's a good compromise and I'm sure we can both walk away happy.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $9500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $11000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm offering the product to you for $10750. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!",10750.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $10250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10250.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to a deal, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $10250. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $11250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!",11250.0,Alice,9,
