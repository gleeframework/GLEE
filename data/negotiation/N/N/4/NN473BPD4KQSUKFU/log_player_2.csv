"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: 

* **Your Value:** You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $140.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $150.

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum price ($150) and lower than John's price ($150), it is the most advantageous option for you."
