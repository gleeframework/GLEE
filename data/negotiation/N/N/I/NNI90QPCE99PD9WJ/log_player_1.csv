Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options.
