"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's in your best interest to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $750,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $925,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I'm looking to get for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit. I need to continue negotiating to lower the price further. Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives me another chance to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $950,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my budget. While I've made some progress in negotiation, I'm starting to run out of time and negotiation space. It's becoming increasingly clear that we might not reach an agreement within my desired price range.  At this point, buying from John for $800,000 is the most sensible option to ensure I get the product within my budget and avoid further negotiation."
