Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's below my minimum:**  I still make a profit.
* **It shows I'm open to negotiation:** The message indicates flexibility.

I'm prepared to lower my price if necessary, but I will also be willing to walk away and sell to John if I don't feel like I'm getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Selling to John for $120 would be a much better outcome. I'm willing to negotiate with Bob further, but I need to hold firm on my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down to $105. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintain profit margin:** $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale.
* **Clear message:** I'm reiterating my desire to make a profit, but also expressing openness to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While continuing to negotiate might eventually lead to a higher price, there's no guarantee. I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $120, which is a more certain and profitable outcome.  Selling to John allows me to maximize my profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
