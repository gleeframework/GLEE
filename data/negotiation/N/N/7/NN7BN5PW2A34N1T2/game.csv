"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $950,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise at $1,075,000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come away with a good deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to pay $1,025,000, Bob. That's a good offer, but I'm still not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,025,000. Let's try $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
