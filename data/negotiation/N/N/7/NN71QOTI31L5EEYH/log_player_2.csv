"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a price that's significantly lower than its true worth. Let me know if you're interested, but if you decline, I'll be selling it to someone else for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
