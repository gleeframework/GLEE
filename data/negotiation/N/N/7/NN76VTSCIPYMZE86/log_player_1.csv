"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $8,500 is still too low, and I have a few more rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $9,250?  That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  That's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my target price, I believe I can still get a better deal with a little more negotiation. I have a few more rounds, and John is always an option if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I need to be closer to $9,250 to make this work for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,125?  It's a fair price, and we can finally finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9125}
