Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm looking to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a high-quality item. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I should accept his offer.
