To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm aiming for. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $2,100,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to find common ground."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,800,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it would bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay a significant amount. While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's still potential to secure a better deal with Bob.  We're not desperate yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,800,000 is getting closer, but it's still a tough pill to swallow considering what this product is worth.  Let's settle this right now. How about $1,950,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to apply some pressure and signal that we're nearing the end of our negotiating window.  A firm but fair offer of $1,950,000 keeps the pressure on Bob while still offering a price significantly above his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it would bring to my business. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to finalize a deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure and is nearing his maximum budget. Accepting his offer of $1,850,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of pushing Bob away completely in further rounds."
