Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe holds immense value, for $1,000,000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential returns will be substantial. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product, given its potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob before I sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the potential benefits. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which represents a fair compromise. This offer is still significantly higher than my initial counter, demonstrating my commitment to making this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $800,000 is my minimum acceptable value for the product, and it's clear that Bob is willing to pay that much.  There's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer in future rounds, and it's not worth risking losing the deal."
