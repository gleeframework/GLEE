"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,000 is still a bit lower than I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, considering the value this product brings to you. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product to you for $11,000.

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  We only have a few rounds left, so let's make this happen. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500.
