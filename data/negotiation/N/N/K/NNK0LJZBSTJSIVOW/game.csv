"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [product name] for a price of $1500000. This is a truly unique product with a lot of potential. I believe this price reflects its value, but I'm open to discussing it further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1500000 is quite a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to lower the price to $1100000.  This would allow me to still make a profit while remaining within a reasonable range for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This shows my genuine interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
