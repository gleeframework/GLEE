Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if possible:
    * Bob gets a $50,000 discount from my guaranteed sale price.
    * I make a $150,000 profit over Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters."
