"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible. You have a good chance of getting a lower price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a significant profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and significantly lower than John's price.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer again, and you might end up paying John's full price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you a good deal and saves you a considerable amount of money."
