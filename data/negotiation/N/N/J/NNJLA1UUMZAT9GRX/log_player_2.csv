"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so rejecting and counteroffering gives you more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $9000. Would you be interested in that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are still better off rejecting the offer and counteroffering.  You can likely get the price lower, and John is always a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $9000. How about we meet in the middle of $9000 and $8500, which would be $8750? Would you be willing to go up to that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is getting closer to your target, you still have some room to negotiate and you're better off trying to get the price down further. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so you have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm still firmly at $8,500.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still willing to compromise. I'm willing to go down to $8250. This is my final offer on this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,250 is close to your target, it's still not quite there. You can likely get the price down further, and you have the option to buy from John for $8,000 as a fallback.  You have 3 rounds left to get the price down further.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down to your price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I hear you're concerned about reaching a compromise. I'm also willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,125? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to go down to $8000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has finally offered the price you are willing to pay. While you could try one more round of negotiation, there's no guarantee that Alice will go lower, and you're already at your target price.  Accepting the offer saves time and ensures you get the product."
