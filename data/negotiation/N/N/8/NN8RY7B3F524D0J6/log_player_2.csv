"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This product offers significant returns, making it a worthwhile investment even at this price.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. You can reject and counteroffer again.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price than John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This would allow me to secure the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about we settle at $1,200,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. You've already rejected her previous counteroffer, and she's indicated this is her final offer.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept John's offer and get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks the possibility of her walking away, leaving you with nothing."
