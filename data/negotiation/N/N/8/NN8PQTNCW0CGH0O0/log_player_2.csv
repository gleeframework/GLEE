"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly before even considering accepting.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive starting point:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual limit ($80). This gives room for negotiation and attempts to bring Alice closer to my desired price range.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** This counter-offer will help me understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While Alice moved down a bit, $110 is still significantly more than I'm willing to pay. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There are still several rounds left, and Alice's willingness to counter suggests she might be flexible. 
 
I'll make another counteroffer, trying to slowly bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind. Could you do it for $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm increasing my offer, signaling I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum budget.
* **Testing the waters:** Offering $70 will show me if Alice is willing to go significantly lower than her last offer or if she's stuck in a higher range.
* **Simple and direct:** Keeping the message straightforward helps avoid unnecessary back and forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $95? That's a significant reduction on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not there yet:**  Alice is coming down, but $95 is still over my budget. 
* **Time to push:** We're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation. I need to make it clear that I'm serious about staying within my budget.

I'll counteroffer again, staying firm but leaving some room for a final compromise."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $80 is the absolute highest I can go.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm presenting my maximum budget at this point. It's important to be firm and clear about this limit.
* **Sense of urgency:**  By phrasing it as my ""absolute highest,"" I'm signaling that this is my final offer, encouraging Alice to make a decision. 
* **Leaving the ball in her court:** It's up to Alice now to decide if she's willing to sell at this price or risk losing the sale."
