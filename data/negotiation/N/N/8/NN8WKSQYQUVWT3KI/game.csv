"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can offer you a compromise at $120, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $120 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $100. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think a fair price for this product is $140. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",140.0,Alice,5,
