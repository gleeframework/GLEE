Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and for you, that value is easily $1,000,000.  I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. Given its potential, I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we have a guaranteed sale with John at that price. This allows us to be ambitious.
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, making the higher price seem reasonable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer gauges Bob's eagerness and potential for exceeding the $1,000,000 baseline.

**Strategy:**

If Bob rejects this initial offer, we can always negotiate downwards, knowing our fallback option with John secures our minimum desired price."
