"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's $12,000, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a lower price. She might be willing to come down further, especially since she values the product significantly less than your maximum budget."
