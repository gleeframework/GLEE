Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
