"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and Alice is offering it for $1,750,000. This is a significant markup.  Bob should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still too high for Bob. He should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his maximum, he can likely still do better by continuing to negotiate.  He's also only halfway through the rounds, so there's plenty of time to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still above my budget. I'm offering $1,450,000.  This is a fair price, and it's getting us closer to a deal. Let's try to find common ground and get this done."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm ready to come down to $1,525,000. This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  He's getting close to his maximum, but he should try to squeeze out a bit more. There are still a few rounds left, and he can likely get a better price with a bit more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. $1,525,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,475,000.  This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1475000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both close to finding a solution that works for us. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's reach an agreement and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  Even though Alice has come down to her minimum, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and this is his last chance to get the product for $1,000,000."
