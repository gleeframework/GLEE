"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product and the potential return on investment it offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring the price down to $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant opportunity.",1725000.0,Alice,5,
