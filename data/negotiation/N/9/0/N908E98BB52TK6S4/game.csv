,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $140? This would be a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $140. I'm willing to compromise at $155. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
