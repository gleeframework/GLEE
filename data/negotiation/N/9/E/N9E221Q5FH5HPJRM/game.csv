"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $107? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",107.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $107 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, so how about we split the difference at $106? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $106 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. How about we meet at $108? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really like the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
