"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I understand the value of the product, I'm working with a tight budget. Could we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
