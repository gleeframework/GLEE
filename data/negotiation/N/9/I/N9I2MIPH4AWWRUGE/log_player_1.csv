{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and negotiating."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've set the initial price at $10,000, knowing the product is worth at least $8,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've explicitly stated that I'm open to negotiation. This helps signal to Bob that I'm willing to compromise and might encourage him to make a counteroffer. 
* **Focus on Value:**  The message highlights the potential value of the product to Bob. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** The initial price is high, aiming for a good return.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  Bob's reaction will give me insight into his perceived value of the product.
* **Maintain Control:** I can either accept a counteroffer if it's reasonable or reject it and counter with a new offer, while always having the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7500.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While it's closer to my minimum than his initial offer, I'm not willing to settle for less than my floor price. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my Position:**  It shows Bob that I'm serious about my minimum value.
* **Negotiate Further:** It gives me the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a price that is mutually acceptable.
* **Secure a Better Deal:**  If Bob is truly interested, he may be willing to compromise further. 

This approach allows me to maximize the potential profit while still staying within my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $7,500 is a bit below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  I'm lowering my price from $10,000 to $8,500, which is a significant concession, but still above my minimum. This shows good faith and encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I remind Bob that I believe the product is worth more, but I'm willing to compromise for a fair deal. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends by inviting Bob to continue the conversation, leaving the door open for further negotiation. 

This approach balances my need to earn a reasonable amount while still being open to a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $8000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair deal considering:

* **Meeting My Minimum:** It ensures I receive my desired value for the product.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  A successful negotiation with Bob could lead to future business opportunities.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Accepting avoids the risk of further negotiations, potentially leading to lower offers or a breakdown in communication.

While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to squeeze out a few hundred dollars more, accepting this offer minimizes risk and ensures a prompt sale."
