"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still possible to negotiate lower.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,500.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $7500 is a bit below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $8500 to make this work.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  $8,500 is better than $10,000, but it's still within reach to get a better deal.  Rejecting and counteroffering again might lead to a more favorable price."
