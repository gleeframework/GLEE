"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Alice's offer is better, but Bob should still reject it and try to negotiate a lower price. There's room for a counteroffer that would save Bob more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so offering $850,000 is a good starting point. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still provides a profit margin for Alice. It's a reasonable counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000, but it's still not a good deal compared to buying from John. There is still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price, but he is still aiming for a better deal. Offering $900,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate but still pushing for a lower price than Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, and there's no guarantee she'll accept a lower counteroffer. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  This ensures he gets the product while minimizing risk and further negotiation.  While it's not the lowest price, it's a reasonable option that ensures a purchase within his budget."
