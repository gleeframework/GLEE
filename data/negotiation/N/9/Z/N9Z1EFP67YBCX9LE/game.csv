"Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to $1100000 to make this work for me. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1050000 is closer to what I need, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1075000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's make this deal happen.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
