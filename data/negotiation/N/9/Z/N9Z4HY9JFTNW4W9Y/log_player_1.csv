"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  This strategy allows me to see if Bob is truly interested and what his upper limit might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if we can bridge the gap.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a substantial profit. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while also indicating that I'm not desperate to sell for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my initial goal, especially since I'm aware John is willing to pay $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still aiming for a profit of $100,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, while also demonstrating that I'm confident in the value of my product.  We're getting closer, and I'm optimistic that Bob will see the value in closing this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation.  While I would love to get more than $1,000,000, I'm running out of time.  It's unlikely Bob will offer more, and John is offering the same amount.  It's time to close the deal and secure a guaranteed profit."
