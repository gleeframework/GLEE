I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a decent starting point, considering the product is worth at least $8,000 to me. It leaves room for negotiation, but I'm not giving it away for cheap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
