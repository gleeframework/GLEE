Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John offers $1,500,000, aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($800,000) might scare him off. We need to find a balance to maximize potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a higher price ($1,300,000) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
