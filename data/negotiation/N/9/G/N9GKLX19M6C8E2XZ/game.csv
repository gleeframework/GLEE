"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare find, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also remaining within my budget.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price that still leaves some room for both of us to make a profit, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to reach a certain price point. I'm willing to offer you $925,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll do one better and offer you the product for $925,000, but I'll throw in a small concession. I'll also include a 1-year warranty, which is a $20,000 value, absolutely free. This way, you'll get the product at the price you want, and you'll also get additional peace of mind. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,
