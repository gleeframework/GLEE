This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential middle ground where we can both walk away happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a compromise."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $11,500 is closer to my budget, I still believe we could find common ground. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

While $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll counteroffer one more time."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $11,250. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows me to cover my expenses.  Would you be willing to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
