Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Sweet Spot:** Your goal is to find a price Bob will accept that's still significantly higher than your minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it potentially goes to another buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** Aim high initially. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to him without revealing your absolute minimum price.
* **Urgency (Slight):** Mentioning other potential buyers can encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go. 
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill.

**Remember:** This is just an initial offer.  Be ready to adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
