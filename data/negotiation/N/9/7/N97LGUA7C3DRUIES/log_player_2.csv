Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting close to my minimum price, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you $81.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.5.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $81.50 is still above my ideal price, it's getting very close to my maximum budget of $150.  Alice has indicated this is her lowest price, so I'm willing to accept the offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more from John."
