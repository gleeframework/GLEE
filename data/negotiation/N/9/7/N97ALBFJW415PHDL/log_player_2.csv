"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $11,000 for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. There are 9 rounds remaining, giving him ample time to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I am proposing a price of $10,750 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offers and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price. While $10,750 is a good price, it's still above what Bob believes he can get.  He has 7 rounds remaining, giving him time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final offer of $10,650 for the product. This price is a reasonable compromise that reflects both our interests and the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily driving the price down. While he could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice is now very close to her minimum acceptable price.  Accepting the offer at $10,650 saves Bob $1,350 compared to buying from John, and is a good deal.  With 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing the deal is high."
