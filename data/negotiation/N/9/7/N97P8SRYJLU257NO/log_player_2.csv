"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $150 to me, and Alice is offering it for $95. While this is a good deal, I can likely get it for a lower price by negotiating.  It's worth exploring my options before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price slightly above Alice's value of $80, but significantly lower than her initial offer of $95. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good deal for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is closer to my maximum value of $150, but it's still not ideal.  I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. It's too soon to consider buying from John at $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer was $100, and I'm willing to move slightly closer to that price. However, I'm still trying to secure a price below $95, as I believe there's room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to my desired price, $105 is still too high. It's worth exploring a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a price closer to $90 or $95.  It's too soon to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer was $105, and I'm willing to meet her halfway at $95. This offer shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a price below $100. It's a good compromise that hopefully leads to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is too high. We've reached a point where the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult.  We're getting close to my maximum value, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal from Alice. It's time to move on and buy the product from John for $150, as this is a more certain outcome than continuing to negotiate."
