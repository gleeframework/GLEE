Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. Aiming high allows room for negotiation and the potential for a significantly higher profit. 
* **Justification for the price:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" without being too specific. This subtly suggests the product might be worth even more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a sense of desirability and urgency.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  How much she's willing to lower the price depends on her risk tolerance and how much she believes Bob is willing to pay."
