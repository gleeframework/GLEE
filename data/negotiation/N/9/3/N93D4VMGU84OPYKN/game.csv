"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to a price point you're comfortable with, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
