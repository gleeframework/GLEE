"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is too high for me. This product fits a very specific need, and my budget for it is limited. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but that price point is still outside my budget. To be completely transparent, I've got another offer for a similar product at $10,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I'm only prepared to go as high as $7,500.  Let me know if that works for you.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
