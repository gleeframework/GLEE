Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $11,500 gives Bob a significant discount while still earning Alice a profit of $1,500.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice is secure knowing she has John as a backup buyer at her minimum acceptable price."
