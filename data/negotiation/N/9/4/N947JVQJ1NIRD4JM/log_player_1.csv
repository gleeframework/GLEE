Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
