Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting with a higher offer ($15,000) allows you to potentially gain more profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value by mentioning ""listing it publicly."" This could make Bob perceive the offer as a special opportunity.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial $15,000, there's a good chance he'll counter-offer, giving you further room to negotiate down towards your minimum acceptable price."
