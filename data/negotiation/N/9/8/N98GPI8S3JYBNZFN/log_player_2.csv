"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  There is plenty of room for negotiation, so it's best to reject and provide a counteroffer closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer allows for negotiation room while signaling your target price range. By being upfront about your budget, you encourage Alice to propose more realistic prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is at least $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer has come down significantly, it's still above both your target price and John's offer. You have room to negotiate further, so rejecting and countering slightly below your maximum price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about $9,500?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer stays below your maximum budget while inching closer to Alice's proposed price. It signals a willingness to negotiate but maintains pressure for a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to your acceptable price, but it's still above John's offer. With several rounds left, you have leverage to push for a price closer to $10,000. By rejecting this offer, you signal your firm stance and increase the pressure on Alice to concede further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still very interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for me. To be honest, my absolute top price is $10,000. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal right now."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this stage, you've established a pattern of negotiation and are close to both your limit and a potentially acceptable price for Alice. By being transparent about your maximum budget, you create a sense of urgency and give Alice a clear choice: accept a price close to her desired range or risk losing the sale. This strategy aims to finalize the negotiation favorably without dragging it out further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made it clear that she's not willing to meet your price point. Her latest offer is even higher than her previous concession. It's unlikely she'll agree to anything close to $10,000. You've negotiated in good faith, and now it's time to cut your losses and take advantage of John's guaranteed offer."
