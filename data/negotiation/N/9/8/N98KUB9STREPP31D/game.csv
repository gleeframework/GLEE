"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a competitive price, Bob.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a very fair offer considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,3,
