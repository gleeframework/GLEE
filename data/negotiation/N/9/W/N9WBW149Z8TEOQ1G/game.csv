"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still a bit away from that number.  How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. This is my best and final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it carefully.",775000.0,Alice,5,
