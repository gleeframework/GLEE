Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,300,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?
