"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product for a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $800,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best and final offer in this range.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a profit, Alice. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my last offer before considering other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
