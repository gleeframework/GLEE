Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob is worthwhile.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a significant profit margin for me while still presenting a potential gain for Bob (saving $100,000 from his perceived value). 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning a limited-time offer and other interested parties, I aim to nudge Bob towards a quicker decision."
