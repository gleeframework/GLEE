"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($2,200,000) compared to your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's not even close to a reasonable starting point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While that offer is significantly below my initial asking price, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,500,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,500,000 is still too high.  While it's better than her original offer, it's still above your maximum budget.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option to secure the product within your financial constraints."
