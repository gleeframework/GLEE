"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to say if $10,000 is a good price, and I can potentially get a better deal. I'll reject and try to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm going to start with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $7,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, but I'm hoping she'll see the value in closing a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll reject and see if I can get her to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'll offer $8,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer, and hopefully shows her that I'm serious about a deal but still want a good price."
