"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $170. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $150. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? I think this is a fair compromise.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already lowered the price from $200 to $170, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $160. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with it.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make one more counteroffer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $155. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",155.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $155. I've already compromised a lot by going from $200 to $170 and then $160. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer you the product for $165. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.",165.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $155. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll make a counteroffer of $157.50. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",157.5,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $157.50. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer you the product for $162.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.",162.5,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $155. I've already compromised a lot, and I don't think I can go any higher. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll make a final counteroffer of $155, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",155.0,Bob,10,
