Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it's a good value for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. It's too far below my minimum value, and I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with that price. While it's getting closer, it's still below my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to meet halfway, and I appreciate that.  However,  $1,025,000 is still just a little too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $1,040,000. This price reflects the value of the product, while still leaving room for a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1040000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $1,040,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,030,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm concerned that further negotiation with Bob won't get me any closer to my desired price. To avoid risking a deal falling through entirely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
