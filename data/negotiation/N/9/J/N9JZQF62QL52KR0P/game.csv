"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it's a good value for me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to meet halfway, and I appreciate that.  However,  $1,025,000 is still just a little too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $1,040,000. This price reflects the value of the product, while still leaving room for a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1040000.0,Alice,5,
