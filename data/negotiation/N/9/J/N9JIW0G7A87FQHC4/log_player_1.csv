Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring I get a significant profit.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message aims to be confident and highlight the product's value without seeming overly aggressive or greedy.  This approach increases the chance of Bob accepting the offer.
 
**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, having John as a backup buyer guarantees I won't be forced to sell for less than $1,200,000."
