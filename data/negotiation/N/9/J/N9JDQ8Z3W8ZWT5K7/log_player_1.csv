Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $140, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum as possible, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $132.50. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $132.50 is a decent compromise.  It's above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
