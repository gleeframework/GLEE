``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It is above Bob's estimated value of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a clear expectation that you're aiming for a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product to me, but I would like to propose a lower price of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're able to offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,125,000. This still allows for some savings while recognizing the value of the product to me.

$1,125,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I would like to counter with a price of $1,130,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise for both of us.

I've reached my limit with Bob. We're not getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running the risk of spending too much time on this negotiation. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
