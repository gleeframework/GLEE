"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a truly unique and valuable product. I believe it holds significant potential for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 is simply not a realistic number for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,350,000?  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1200000. How about we meet in the middle at $1325000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up significantly from his initial offer, and we're now only $25,000 apart.  It's getting close to my minimum, and I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, we might not reach a deal before the 10 rounds are up.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and close the deal."
