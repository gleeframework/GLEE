"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering I'm only looking to spend up to $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $8,750, which is closer to my maximum. This offer is a good compromise and allows both of us to make a fair deal. Let's try to close this now, I'm confident we can find common ground.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,200. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,750. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. I'm willing to stick with this price, but if you're not open to it, I may need to explore other options.",8750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and offer it to you for $9,150. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9150.0,Alice,7,
