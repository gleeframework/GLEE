{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's quality, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than my preferred price, but it's getting closer.
* I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get even lower.
* It's possible I can convince Alice to go down further.
* I'll keep in mind that John is always an option at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000. It's my maximum budget for this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To facilitate a successful transaction, I am willing to consider $11000 as the final price for the product. This offers a fair compromise between our respective positions. I hope this proposal will meet your approval. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit.
* I've already made two counteroffers and Alice seems unwilling to budge below $11,000.
* With John offering the product at $10,000, it's a safer and more cost-effective option at this point.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially miss out on this guaranteed deal."
