Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its unique value proposition, I'm setting the price at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and encourage Bob to consider the potential return on his investment.
* **Exclusivity:** By mentioning Bob has the first chance, it creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if he doesn't buy.

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price from Bob while still keeping the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
