"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
