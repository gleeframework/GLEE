"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a strong offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in reaching a deal.  Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $980,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's true value.",980000.0,Alice,5,
