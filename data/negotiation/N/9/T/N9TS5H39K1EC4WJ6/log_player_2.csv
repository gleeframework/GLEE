# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and presents a strong investment opportunity.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I see the potential in this product, I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $2,000,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should continue to negotiate by rejecting and making a new counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my acceptable range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $800,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair transaction for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement with some further compromise."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a significant investment for you, I understand, but it reflects the true potential and return you'll gain. Let's close this deal - are you in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has reached his limit. Alice is still too high, and Bob can get a better deal from John.  There's no need to keep negotiating with Alice."
