Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While I want the best possible price, I'm starting slightly below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation but still ensures I'm above the product's worth to Bob.
* **Positive Framing:**  I focus on the benefits for Bob by highlighting the potential profit he can make. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be ready to respond to Bob's counteroffer if he rejects my initial offer. If his counteroffer isn't satisfactory, I'll make a counteroffer and be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't reach a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob expressed interest, which indicates a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to work with him.
* **Reiterate value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing the potential profit he can still make.
* **Open-ended:**  I end with an open-ended question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to respond to Bob's next move, whether it's another counteroffer or acceptance of my proposal.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll be ready to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920,000. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $920,000 is still below my desired price of $1,200,000, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a risk that Bob will continue to counteroffer at lower prices or walk away entirely if I reject this offer. 
* **Time is a factor:**  It's possible that John might become unavailable or change his mind.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and proceed with the sale. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise that allows me to secure a sale and avoid potential complications."
