"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks promising, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair middle ground that takes into account your concerns and the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours? I'd be willing to do $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far from where I'd like to be. Considering the value I believe the product holds, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,225,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
