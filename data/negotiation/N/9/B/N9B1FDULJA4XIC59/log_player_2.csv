Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair middle ground that takes into account your concerns and the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far from where I'd like to be. Considering the value I believe the product holds, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,225,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and while getting the product for $1,225,000 is a decent deal, getting it for $1,200,000 from John is the most financially sound choice."
