Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,000? This would still leave me with a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $12,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit low. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a higher price in the next round. I'm still confident that I can get a better deal, and I don't want to sell for less than my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not able to go lower than $13,500. This price reflects the true value of the product, and it's a fair compromise considering our previous offers. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to get a fair price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I have a few rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see you're getting closer to my desired price point.  However, $12,800 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm getting close to considering buying from John. I'm willing to meet you at $12,900, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'm close to an agreement with Bob, it's getting a bit risky to keep negotiating, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price. John is offering my minimum acceptable value, so it's the safest and most profitable option at this point."
