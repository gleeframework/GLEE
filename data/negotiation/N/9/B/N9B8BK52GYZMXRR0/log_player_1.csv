{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $170 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $170, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, mentioning its value and using positive language. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profits:** I'm starting high to see if I can get a better deal than John's offer.
* **Encourage negotiation:** The message is designed to open a conversation and encourage Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By mentioning John, I'm reminding Bob that I have another potential buyer, adding pressure to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $170 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to make a deal, accepting his offer would be a substantial loss.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:** I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate my willingness to walk away, which can encourage Bob to increase his offer.
* **Avoid a bad deal:** Accepting his offer would be a significant loss.  

I'll counter with a price higher than $100 but lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your offer. How about $125? It's a good compromise that reflects the value of the product while being within your budget. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering with $125, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and encourages further negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm framing $125 as a compromise, appealing to his desire for a good deal. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Move towards a compromise:** By lowering my price, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Maintain leverage:** The message is positive and encourages a response from Bob. It doesn't completely close the door on further negotiations.
* **Avoid a bad deal:** $125 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is still lower than my preferred price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Considering:

* **Potential for further negotiation:**  It's likely that Bob won't budge much further.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's no guarantee he'll counter again, and I might lose the deal entirely.
* **Time commitment:** Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort.

Accepting Bob's offer will secure a sale at a price that is still reasonably good. It's a calculated risk, but it balances my desire to maximize profit with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
