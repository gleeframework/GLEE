Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers, but I won't go below my minimum of $12,000.  I also have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $11,500. This is a compromise,  lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will get us closer to a deal, while still ensuring I get a decent price."

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's better to secure a sale than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether."
