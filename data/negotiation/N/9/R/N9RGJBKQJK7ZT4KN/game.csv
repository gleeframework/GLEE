"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still offers you a profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. It's not even close to covering my costs.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $900,000? This would still give you a healthy profit margin, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that number.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",800000.0,Alice,5,
