"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a fantastic opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision to purchase it from me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  Since you value the product at $800,000, you can potentially get it for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $700,000, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and $675,000 is a good compromise.  It's still below my valuation of $800,000, and significantly less than John's price of $800,000.  Accepting the offer saves me $125,000 compared to buying from John."
