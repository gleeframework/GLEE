"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $9500 for the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8500. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $8200? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8750? It's a bit closer to your target, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8750.0,Alice,5,
