# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential value.  Let me know what you think.
