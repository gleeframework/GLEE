"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to entice Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

**Strategy:** I want to gauge Bob's initial interest and potentially get him to make a counteroffer, allowing me to understand his valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still above $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I have 10 rounds and can potentially get a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:**  While $10,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm not desperate for a quick deal. I have the potential to get a better offer from Bob. 

**Strategy:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that is slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than his current offer. This will keep the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping for something closer to my initial offer.  How about $13,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a counter-offer that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Show Flexibility:** This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to get closer to my desired price while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to move closer to my price or if we'll need to continue bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a counter-offer that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer.

* **Highlighting Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $11750 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still a bit lower than my desired price, but it's only $1,000 less than my last counteroffer. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We are in round 8, and I only have 2 rounds left.  The risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially failing to reach a deal is increasing.
* **John's Offer:**  While $10,000 is a guaranteed sale, Bob's offer is better and only $1,000 less than what I initially offered.

**Strategy:** I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale and ensure I don't lose out on the opportunity to sell the product for a better price than John's offer. 

**Conclusion:** It's important to weigh the risk of continuing the negotiation against the potential gain. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's better to secure a good deal than to risk losing the sale entirely."
