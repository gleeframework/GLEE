"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm aiming to find a price that's fair to both of us, while still getting a good return on my investment.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider whether to lower the price slightly or try a different approach.  I also need to keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if I feel the negotiation isn't going anywhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value:** While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me to consider selling the product.
* **Negotiation space remains:**  There's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my ideal.
* **Potential for better deal:** By continuing the negotiation, I could potentially get closer to my target price of $14,000 or even higher. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If the negotiation fails to produce a satisfactory outcome, I can always sell to John for $15,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000.  I'll try to emphasize the value of the product and the benefits Bob will receive from owning it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This price reflects the product's value and still allows for some room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob of the benefits he'll receive from owning it.
* **Mutual satisfaction:** I highlight that this price allows for both of us to be happy with the deal.
* **Open-ended question:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his reaction.  If he rejects this offer, I might need to consider lowering my price further or potentially selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,200. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $13,200 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $13,500, which I set in the previous round to demonstrate my willingness to compromise.
* **Negotiation space remains:** There's still a small gap between our offers, and further negotiation might lead to a price closer to my target.
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's still a chance that Bob might be willing to increase his offer slightly. 
* **John remains a backup option:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with $13,400. I'll emphasize the value of the product and try to convince Bob that this is a fair price that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget.  How about we meet halfway again? I'm willing to come down to $13,400.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (again):**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $13,400, which is halfway between my previous offer ($13,500) and Bob's offer ($13,200). This shows my flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I reiterate that this price is fair for both of us, and it highlights the value of the product.
* **Positive tone and encouragement:** I use a positive tone and encourage Bob to finalize the deal.  I also express my eagerness to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response and be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his reaction.  If he rejects this offer, I might need to consider lowering my price further or potentially selling to John if the negotiation stalls. However, I'm hopeful that we can close the deal on this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,250. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $13,200. 
* **Limited negotiation space:**  The remaining negotiation space is very small.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will significantly increase the price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he'll walk away, and I might not be able to secure a better price in the remaining rounds.
* **Time pressure:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances."
