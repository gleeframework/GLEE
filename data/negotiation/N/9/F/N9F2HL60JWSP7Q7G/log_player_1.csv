Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($100), but it leaves room for negotiation if he's interested. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring a sale at your minimum acceptable price."
