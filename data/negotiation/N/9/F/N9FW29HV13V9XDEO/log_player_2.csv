"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than what you're willing to pay. You have room to negotiate and try to get a better price. Buying from John right now would be settling for your maximum price without attempting to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A strong counteroffer helps understand if Alice is open to negotiating or firm on a price close to her initial offer. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it gives us space to gradually increase our bid over subsequent rounds. 

Keep in mind, going too low might offend Alice, but it's a calculated risk to see how much we can save."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too far off for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This product is truly valuable, and I believe it's worth the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your target price. There's no point in further negotiation or buying from John since you've achieved the best possible outcome. Accepting now secures the product at your desired price."
