"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to make the offer more appealing. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started and see if Bob is willing to come up in price. I'm keeping my options open by not immediately going for the full $15,000 in case Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $8,000. Accepting this would result in a huge loss for me.
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:** I can still try to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price.  There are 8 rounds left, which provides ample opportunity.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While I prefer to get the best deal possible, selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum price. This option is a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our price expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,000? It's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price from $12,000 to $10,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob that $10,000 is still a good price for him, considering the product's value to him. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I end with a positive and open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially move the negotiation forward. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and gauge Bob's willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired range, but I'm also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate to get the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than his initial offer of $7,000 and is close to my last counteroffer of $10,000.
* **Time is a factor:** We're already in round 4, and time is ticking.  Each round we go through increases the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Potential for higher offers:**  While I prefer a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will come up higher in the following rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a decent price.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If negotiations continue to stall, I can still sell to John for $15,000. 

Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,000, as it's a good compromise and secures a sale without risking further delays or potential loss of the deal."
