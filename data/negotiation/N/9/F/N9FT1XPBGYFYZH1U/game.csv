"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This offer reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  I'm still thinking closer to $7,000 would be a fair deal.  What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see you're set on a lower price point, $7,000 is just too low for what this product offers. To be fair to both of us, I could consider $9,500.  This is my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I understand this is your final offer, but I can't quite meet that.  If you're willing to settle at $8,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,
