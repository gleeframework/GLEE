Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This offer reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  I'm still thinking closer to $7,000 would be a fair deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see you're set on a lower price point, $7,000 is just too low for what this product offers. To be fair to both of us, I could consider $9,500.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I understand this is your final offer, but I can't quite meet that.  If you're willing to settle at $8,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has met my reservation price of $8,000. While I could push for more or sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000,  accepting now ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
