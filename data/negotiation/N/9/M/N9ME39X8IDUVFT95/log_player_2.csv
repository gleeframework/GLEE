"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $120. 
* **You have room to negotiate.**  There are 10 rounds, and you can always buy from John for $150 if the deal falls through. 
* **A counteroffer is a good starting point.** This allows you to see if Alice is flexible and willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting lower:** This counteroffer is $15 lower than Alice's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **A reasonable starting point:** $105 is still above Alice's value of $100, giving her some room to make a profit. 
* **Setting a clear price:**  By offering a specific price, you avoid endless back and forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she has moved closer, $115 is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **You have time to negotiate.**  You have 7 rounds left, and there is still potential to find a price that works for both of you. 
* **Counteroffering again is the best strategy.**  You can try to push Alice closer to your target price of $105."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $115 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying close to your target:** This counteroffer is only $5 away from your target price of $105. 
* **Being reasonable:**  Splitting the difference shows a commitment to finding a solution.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  A friendly message keeps the negotiation productive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $112.50. That's the lowest I can go for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your price:**  $112.50 is only $7.50 away from your target of $105. 
* **You've made progress in negotiations:**  Alice has lowered her price significantly from the initial $120. 
* **The risk of continuing is high:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, you're approaching the point where it might be better to accept and avoid the risk of ending up with John's higher price. 

While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of failing and having to buy from John for $150 is too high at this point.  It's a reasonable compromise that saves you money compared to John's offer."
