"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $13,000 is better than John's price of $12,000, Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate. There's a good chance he can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum price of $12,000 as possible.  He starts with a counteroffer of $12,500, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $13,000.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal, and it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer and closer to her original price. However, Bob is still determined to get the best possible deal. He has 7 rounds left and believes he can still negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate but also trying to get a good deal.  He's raised his offer by $300 from the previous round, hoping that this small increase might be enough to persuade Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to her original asking price and is significantly higher than Bob's target of $12,000. With only 5 rounds remaining, the chances of negotiating a better deal are slim. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000 to ensure he gets the product at his desired price point.  He has already saved $1,000 compared to Alice's initial offer, and the risk of getting a worse deal with Alice is too high at this point."
