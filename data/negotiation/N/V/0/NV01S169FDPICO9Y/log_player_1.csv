``` 

While we could continue negotiating, accepting $1,850,000 is a strong outcome. Bob has consistently shown willingness to move closer to our price, and we're already significantly above his perceived value.  Continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal altogether, especially as we approach the halfway point."
