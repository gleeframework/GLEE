"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,000,000.  If we can't find common ground, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to see some movement on price for this deal to make sense for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I hope you'll reconsider. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving on the price.  While I had hoped for a higher number, I'm willing to accept your offer of $1,100,000 to close this deal. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
