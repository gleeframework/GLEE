Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage and potentially negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While it's tempting, I'm aiming to spend a little less.  How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still a good profit for me, exceeding my minimum of $80. It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection."
