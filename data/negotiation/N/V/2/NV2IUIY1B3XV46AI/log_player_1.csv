Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle at $14,000? That's a substantial compromise on my end.

While I could try to squeeze a bit more from Bob, there's a real chance he'll walk away.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation."
