"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a bold move, but it allows me to maximize potential profit. If Bob is truly interested, he may be willing to negotiate down from this point.  If he rejects, I'll reassess and make a more realistic counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I'm hoping to find a deal that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $920,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, it's a good price and we're getting closer to a deal.  It's better than selling to John for $800,000, and we have more rounds to potentially negotiate further."
