# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as the price John is selling for, there's no advantage to buying from Alice.  Both options cost the same. You might as well buy from John."
