{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to try to negotiate a better price.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, considering the value this product brings.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find it to be a profitable investment. Keep in mind I have another offer for $800000 on the table, so this is truly a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to bring the price down further. I'll try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have another offer, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a profitable investment for you as well."", ""product_price"": 800000}
