"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. It's important to be confident and show the value of the product from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $750000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my value. I'm also going to leverage the fact that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $800,000. This will give me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, considering the value this product brings.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find it to be a profitable investment. Keep in mind I have another offer for $800,000 on the table, so this is truly a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another offer, but $850000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a profitable investment for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great outcome! Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting this offer means I get my desired amount and I don't need to risk further negotiation.  There's no need to involve John at this point."
