"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $750000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, considering the value this product brings.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find it to be a profitable investment. Keep in mind I have another offer for $800000 on the table, so this is truly a competitive price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another offer, but $850000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a profitable investment for you as well.",800000.0,Bob,4,
