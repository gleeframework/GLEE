"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being a fair deal for me.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $625,000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm now offering it to you for $700,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you and my own interests.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $660,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm now offering it to you for $680,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",680000.0,Alice,7,
