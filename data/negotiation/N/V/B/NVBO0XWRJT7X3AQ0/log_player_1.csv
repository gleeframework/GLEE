{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I'd accept, but knowing Bob is interested, I'm hoping he'll negotiate down to a price that's still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $150. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value I'm offering.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $140. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $135 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still determined to get closer to my minimum value of $150 and I think I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $135 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $145, which is a fair compromise considering the value you're getting. Let's make this happen. "", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to the price I'm willing to pay, and I think we're getting close to a deal. How about we meet at $138? I'm willing to pay that, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $138
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm close to my minimum value with Bob's offer of $138, I don't want to risk going back and forth further and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John for $150.  John offers a guaranteed profit, so it's the safest and most profitable option for me right now."
