"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $12000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $13500. How about $12500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $14000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $14250? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",14250.0,Alice,7,

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $12000. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. If you're not willing to sell it to me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying it from John for $12000.",12000.0,Bob,8,
