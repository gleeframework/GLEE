"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price you proposed is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to  $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle on $925,000?  This reflects a substantial discount while acknowledging the product's worth.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $925,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while fitting within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $850,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a great value for a product of this caliber.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $850,000 is  a difficult price point for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000.  If that's not agreeable, I understand, but I do need to stay within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,6,
