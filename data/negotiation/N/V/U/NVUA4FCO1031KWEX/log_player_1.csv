"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price you proposed is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to  $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle on $925,000?  This reflects a substantial discount while acknowledging the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $925,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while fitting within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While Bob is moving closer to our range, we need to hold firm to signal the product's value. We are willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $850,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a great value for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  At this stage, we need to signal some flexibility but also firmness.  We're moving closer to Bob's price range but setting a firm limit with the ""final offer"" statement. This adds weight to the offer and potentially encourages Bob to accept.  We are still leaving room to accept a counteroffer slightly below $850,000 if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $850,000 is  a difficult price point for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000.  If that's not agreeable, I understand, but I do need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While slightly below our target, accepting Bob's offer of $800,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** $800,000 is still a significant profit margin. Holding out for more risks losing the sale entirely.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has consistently moved upwards in his offers, and his latest message suggests he's nearing his maximum budget.
* **Time Investment:**  Continuing negotiations prolongs the process and incurs opportunity costs. Accepting now allows us to focus on other potential deals. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's final offer, even with a concession on our part, can foster goodwill for future business. 

While selling to John guarantees our desired price, accepting Bob's offer represents a strong balance of profit, risk management, and potential for a positive ongoing business relationship."
