This offer allows for some negotiation space while still ensuring a profit for me. It's important to start strong but be open to negotiation, especially since John is a guaranteed buyer at the minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with him to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, as I'm not yet ready to sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident the product will be worth every penny to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,175,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from it.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm going to counter again and see if we can find a middle ground. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,175,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we settle at $1,190,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1190000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,180,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,180,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting close, it's still below my minimum. I've negotiated with him for a while, and it seems we're at an impasse.  It's time to move on and accept John's offer to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000.  I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale."
