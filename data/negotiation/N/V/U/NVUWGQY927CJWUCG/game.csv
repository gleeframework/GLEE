"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you be open to $8,500?  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,750 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,600.  Let's try to make this work.",8600.0,Bob,4,
