{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. It's also a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, making it appealing to Bob. This strategy aims to start the negotiation positively and potentially close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I could accept his offer and earn some profit, it's not a satisfactory outcome. I will counteroffer with a higher price to see if we can reach a more agreeable compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $6,000 is too far below my minimum.  Would you consider $8,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $8,000. It's a good compromise that's still fair considering the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 8000}
