"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, but also allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product and is still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is still above Bob's ideal price but represents a significant drop from the original $900,000.  At this point, it's a good compromise. Bob can potentially continue negotiating, but there is a risk of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further, leading him to pay John's full price of $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob saves $175,000 compared to buying from John."
