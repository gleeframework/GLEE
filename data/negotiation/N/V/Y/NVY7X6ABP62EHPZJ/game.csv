"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $900000 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750000. This reflects the value I see in the product, but also allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product and is still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
