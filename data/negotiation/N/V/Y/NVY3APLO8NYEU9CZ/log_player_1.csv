Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 as a starting point for further negotiation.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made.  However, $1,550,000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,400,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to go above his final offer of $1,400,000.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option to ensure Alice receives her desired value for the product.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a lower potential payout and carries the risk of him walking away."
