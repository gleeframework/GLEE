"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield a significant return on your investment.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 as a starting point for further negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the gap between our valuations is quite significant. I'm open to negotiation but need to see a number that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a substantial price reduction and a fair offer considering the potential this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but I need us to find a more realistic middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working to find a compromise.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to drop my price significantly to $1,700,000.  This is a large concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to adjust your price is encouraging.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,350,000.  I feel this offer respects the product's value while fitting within the parameters I need to work with.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.  It represents a significant discount and a real opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made.  However, $1,550,000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,400,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
