{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a bit lower than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  This strategy balances the need to get a good price with the desire to keep Bob engaged in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $12,000.  You'll make more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable, and I'm willing to work with you to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}
