"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but that's my maximum budget. Can you consider meeting me in the middle at $1650000?",1650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1650000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1700000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1650000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider meeting me at $1675000?",1675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1675000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1700000 and $1675000, which would be $1687500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1687500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1650000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1680000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",1680000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1680000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and meet you at $1690000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1690000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1690000 and $1650000, which would be $1670000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",1670000.0,Bob,8,
