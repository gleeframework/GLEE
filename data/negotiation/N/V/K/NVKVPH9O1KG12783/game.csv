"I can see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However,  $110 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we settle at $70? That seems like a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,,

"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $95. I'm getting close to my minimum price, so this is as low as I can go.",95.0,Alice,5,,
