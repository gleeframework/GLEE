,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $8500 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To try to meet somewhere in the middle, I propose we set the price for the product at $9500. This still allows for a good profit margin while remaining within your budget.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9500 is getting closer, it's still a bit higher than my ideal price point. I'm willing to go up to $9000 for the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome, I suggest we settle on a price of $9200 for the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
