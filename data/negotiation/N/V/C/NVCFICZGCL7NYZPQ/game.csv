"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a good compromise considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. How about $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more to make this work.  How about $10,750? That's a fair compromise, and it's still significantly less than the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,250 and $10,750. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
