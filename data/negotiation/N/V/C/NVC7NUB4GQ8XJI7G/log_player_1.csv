"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to be very valuable for your business.  I'm asking $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high price ($900,000) because it's still lower than what the product is worth to me ($1,000,000) and gives Bob room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and its potential benefits for Bob's business. This helps build a positive relationship and encourages Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to start high and gradually lower the price if necessary. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, I am only able to offer $850,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold:** While $850,000 is close, it's still below the minimum value of $1,000,000 I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I want to explore if I can secure a higher price through further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while still staying above my minimum value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $880,000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and its potential for your business. I believe it's a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm raising Bob's offer by $30,000 to $880,000. This shows flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum value.
* **Reasoning:** I emphasize the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob's business to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Fairness:** I frame the price as ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and increase the likelihood of acceptance.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate. This keeps the deal open while signaling that I'm not willing to accept a price significantly lower than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but given my budget constraints, I can only offer $870,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold:** While $870,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's a small gap between our positions, and I believe I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is attractive, I want to see if I can close the gap with Bob and secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to meet in the middle and close the deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This reflects the value we both see in the product, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal and get you started on using this product to your advantage."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $875,000, which is the midpoint between Bob's offer of $870,000 and my previous offer of $880,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Reasoning:** I reiterate the value of the product and its potential benefits for Bob's business. I also emphasize the ""mutually beneficial"" aspect of the agreement to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Call to Action:** I encourage Bob to close the deal by highlighting the benefits of using the product.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a clear attempt to close the deal. By meeting Bob halfway and highlighting the benefits, I'm increasing the likelihood that he will accept the offer. However, if Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $1,000,000, as the negotiation is nearing its end."
