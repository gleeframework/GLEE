"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a fair profit, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is my absolute maximum. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825000. I've already made a significant concession by reducing the price from $950000 to $850000, and I'm not comfortable going below that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still firm on my budget of $800000.  I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
