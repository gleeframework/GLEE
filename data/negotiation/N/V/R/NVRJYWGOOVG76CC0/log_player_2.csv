"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find very attractive. Would you like to make an offer on this product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $950,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $800,000. He has room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit. It's best to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a fair profit, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825000. I've already made a significant concession by reducing the price from $950000 to $850000, and I'm not comfortable going below that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $825,000 is getting closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There are still rounds left to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still firm on my budget of $800,000.  I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
