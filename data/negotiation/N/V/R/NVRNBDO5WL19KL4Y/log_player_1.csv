"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has the potential to be equally valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, which leaves room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still leaving a significant profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By using language like ""leaves room for negotiation,"" I'm signaling that I'm open to compromise, which could encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob, which might make him more inclined to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly higher than his initial perceived value, it's still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it would leave me with a profit significantly lower than what I could achieve by selling to John.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes of getting a better price, but I'm not going to settle for anything below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident this product can bring you incredible value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,200,000. This shows that I'm taking Bob's concerns seriously and am open to negotiation.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential value the product offers, reinforcing why this price is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language like ""bridge the gap"" and ""commitment to finding a solution"" to create a sense of collaboration and goodwill.
* **Reasonable Counteroffer:** $1,200,000 is a reasonable counteroffer â€“ it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still seeking a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome. Selling to John at $1,500,000 is still a much more lucrative option. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than my minimum. I need to push for a higher price, even if it means risking the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. However, I need to be realistic about the value I'm placing on this product.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefit this product offers.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Compromise:** I'm showing that I'm taking Bob's offer seriously by decreasing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,300,000. This demonstrates a commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential benefits of the product, subtly emphasizing its worth.
* **Fairness:** I'm positioning the price as ""fair"" and a ""significant compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and justice.
* **Finality:** I'm using the phrase ""What do you say?"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.

This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. It's crucial to balance the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I perceive in the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not quite there. Selling to John at $1,500,000 remains a more appealing option.  I'm determined to push for a price closer to my minimum, but I need to be strategic. If I reject his offer, I need to be prepared to offer a counteroffer that is both appealing and leaves some room for further negotiation. I'm not willing to give up on the potential for a higher price just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, and I'm getting a clearer sense of where we both stand.  To reach an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product while acknowledging your budgetary concerns. It's a small step closer to your proposal, and I believe it represents a good compromise. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Understanding:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position and showing that I'm listening to his concerns.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that the price is ""fair"" and reflects the ""value of the product"".
* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my offer slightly to show flexibility but still staying above my minimum.
* **Urgency:** I'm using the phrase ""Let's make this happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage a positive response.

This counteroffer is a small step towards Bob's proposal, but it still maintains a decent profit for me. The goal is to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while showing that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is finally above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Although I would prefer to get closer to the $1,500,000 I could get from John, I'm running out of time, and this offer is a good compromise.  I'm also considering the potential for future business with Bob. If he's a reliable client, it could be beneficial to build a relationship, even at a slightly lower price."
