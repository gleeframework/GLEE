"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John at $1,000,000 saves you $250,000, making it the most financially sound decision."
