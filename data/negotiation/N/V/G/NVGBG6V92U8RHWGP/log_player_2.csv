"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $11,000. It's a steal for what it's worth, and I'm sure you'll agree! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? That's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still aiming to save as much as possible, and while Alice's price is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price.  There's still time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. That's fair for both of us, and it gets us both to our goals."", ""product_price"": 10000}
