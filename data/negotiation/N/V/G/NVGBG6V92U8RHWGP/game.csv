"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? That's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. That's fair for both of us, and it gets us both to our goals.",10000.0,Bob,4,
