"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
That offer is way too high! I'll try to negotiate it down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my maximum budget ($80) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite but clearly states my budget limitations.  
* **Aiming for a Deal:** This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to consider a price within my range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above my budget. I'll counteroffer again, moving closer to my limit but leaving room for one more round of negotiation if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $60. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to $75, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate but staying firmly below my $80 limit.
* **Sense of Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise and positions $75 as a fair deal for both of us.
* **Final Offer (Almost):** This counteroffer signals that I'm getting close to my maximum price. If Alice rejects it, I'm strongly considering John's offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference and call it $82.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging enough.  While $82.50 is tempting, I have a standing offer from John for $80. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer to stay within my budget."
