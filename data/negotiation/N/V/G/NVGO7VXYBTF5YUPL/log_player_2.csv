"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $800,000 is his maximum budget, it's likely Alice is willing to negotiate. By rejecting the first offer, Bob can see if Alice is willing to lower the price. There's no downside to this initial rejection, as he can still buy from John for the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Starting with a counteroffer that's 10% lower than Alice's initial offer (which is also his maximum budget) is a good starting point. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a significant amount, but also establishes a lower price point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there is still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price. If he accepts now, he loses the chance to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to $700,000.  By offering $725,000, he's showing willingness to compromise while staying within his desired price range.  This counteroffer is a reasonable midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $740,000 is now very close to Bob's desired price range. It's a significant saving compared to his initial budget of $800,000, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without risking further negotiations."
