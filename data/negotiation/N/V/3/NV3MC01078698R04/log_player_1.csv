"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is above the product's worth to Bob ($120), but not exorbitantly high. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the product's potential value to Bob, hinting at its worth. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and slowly decrease the price if necessary. I have the option to sell to John for $120, so I have a safety net if Bob refuses to budge. I'll aim for a final price between $120 and $130."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product looks great, but $130 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is low, I believe there's still room for negotiation. He recognizes the product's value and is willing to engage. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I want to signal that I'm not willing to accept such a low offer, but I'm open to further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial $130 offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and clear, restating my minimum acceptable price while offering a compromise.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** The message ends with a question to encourage Bob to engage further and potentially agree.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay closer to my desired price. If not, I have the option to sell to John, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal that's significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $107 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While he is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are still too low for me to accept.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe that further negotiation could lead to a better deal closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter again. I will aim for a price in the $110-$115 range, demonstrating my flexibility while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to sell at such a low price when I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $112? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  $112 is a compromise between my previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $107. It's a clear signal that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair price,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity and potentially pushing him to consider the offer.
* **Urgency Implied:**  The phrase ""closer to what I need"" subtly suggests that I'm not willing to keep negotiating indefinitely, which could motivate Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to incentivize Bob to accept. It's close enough to his last offer to be appealing, but still above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects, I'm ready to counter again, but I'm getting closer to my decision point of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  I could go up to $109, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $109 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. He's inching closer, but not close enough for me to accept.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** His statement about it being his ""absolute limit"" suggests that further negotiation might be unproductive.
* **John is a safe option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $120, so there's no pressure to settle for a lower price.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, but I will be more direct in my communication about my minimum price. If Bob is not willing to meet me there, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $109 is still too far below my minimum price. I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $118. If you're not able to reach that price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  I'm confident you'll find this product valuable, and I hope we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 118}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I've set a clear minimum price, but I've framed it as a necessary price to make the deal work, not an unreasonable demand.
* **Urgency and Alternative:** I've mentioned moving on to another buyer, adding a sense of urgency and highlighting my willingness to walk away.
* **Focus on Value:**  I've reiterated the product's value to Bob, hoping to remind him of its worth and make him reconsider.

**Strategy:**

This is my final attempt to get closer to my desired price. I'm firm on my minimum price, but I'm hoping that the combination of a fair price, urgency, and emphasis on value will persuade Bob to accept. If not, I'll happily sell to John for $120."
