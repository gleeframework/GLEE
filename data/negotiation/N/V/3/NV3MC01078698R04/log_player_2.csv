Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $109 is still too far below my minimum price. I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $118. If you're not able to reach that price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  I'm confident you'll find this product valuable, and I hope we can find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118

It's time to switch to John. Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and risking further negotiation for a potential savings of $2 isn't worth the possibility of losing out altogether.  Buying from John guarantees you get the product at a price you know is fair."
