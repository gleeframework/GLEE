"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product! Considering its value, I'm offering it at $14,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire it at a great price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. While it's lower than John's price, we have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.
* **Targeting Above Alice's Value:**  We're aiming for a price above Alice's $12,000 valuation, but well below her initial asking price and our maximum budget.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This counteroffer signals that we're serious about the purchase but expect Alice to move from her initial position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is quite a bit below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to her perceived value, but we still have room for negotiation. A price of $12,500 is better than John's offer, but we can try to push for a slightly lower price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $11,500?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We are making a smaller counteroffer increase ($1000) to show Alice we are willing to negotiate but still want a lower price.
* **Staying Below Alice's Offer:**  We want to keep the negotiation moving towards a favorable outcome for us. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This positions us well for a potential final counteroffer from Alice that is closer to her value and acceptable for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $12,100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $12,100 is a very good price, significantly below John's offer and only slightly above Alice's perceived value. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away, or she might not go much lower. Accepting now secures a very favorable price. 
* **Time Value:**  We've already had several rounds of negotiation. Accepting now saves time and likely gets us a price very close to the best we could achieve."
