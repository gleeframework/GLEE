"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $110 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to consider $106.50. That's the closest we've gotten so far, and I'd like to try to meet you in the middle.",106.5,Bob,6,
