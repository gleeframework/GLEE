Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:**  This is a price that is above Bob's perceived value but still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation but sets a high starting point.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob.  I am aiming to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired amount. If his counteroffers are too low, I will be prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a significant improvement over Bob's initial assessment of $800,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price when I have a guaranteed alternative with John.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired amount, likely somewhere between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. This will show Bob that I am serious about getting a fair price while still leaving room for further negotiation.  If he continues to be unwilling to budge, I will be prepared to walk away and sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:** This price is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This allows for further negotiation without risking a sale to John.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and reiterates Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the value proposition and my willingness to compromise.  The goal is to keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid an impasse.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he remains unwilling to budge, I will need to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price when I have a guaranteed alternative with John.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired amount, likely somewhere between $1,000,000 and $1,050,000. This will show Bob that I am serious about getting a fair price while still leaving room for further negotiation.  If he continues to be unwilling to budge, I will be prepared to walk away and sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,050,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $950,000. It's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's a significant step closer to my desired price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the need to finalize the deal. It also highlights the fact that this is a fair price for both parties.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we meet at $980,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $980,000 is closer to my desired price than before, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've been willing to negotiate and compromise, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that is far below what the product is worth to me. 

I've already established a guaranteed alternative with John, who is willing to buy the product for my minimum acceptable price. At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John and secure a higher price than to continue negotiating with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my price expectations."
