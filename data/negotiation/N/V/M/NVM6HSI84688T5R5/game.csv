"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we meet at $980,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
