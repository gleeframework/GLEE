"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $9,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $10,250, the product is still well within his budget and cheaper than John's price. It's a good compromise and a fair deal."
