Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he counter-offers. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you think the product is ""worth a lot,"" you're subtly justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal this to Bob immediately. It's good to have leverage but using it too early can backfire."
