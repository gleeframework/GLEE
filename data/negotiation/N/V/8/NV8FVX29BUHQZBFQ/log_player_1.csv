Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I have 8 rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I have 6 rounds remaining and am confident I can get a better deal. I will continue to try and negotiate with Bob."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're down to the last two rounds, and Bob is stuck at $1,200,000. While I could try to counteroffer one last time, there's no guarantee he'll budge, and I risk losing the deal altogether. John's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly better, and I'm confident I can get a similar deal elsewhere in the future."
