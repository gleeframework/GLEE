"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13000? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet at $13000 due to my financial constraints. I would like to propose $12000 as a counteroffer. This amount aligns more closely with my budget while still allowing you a reasonable profit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
