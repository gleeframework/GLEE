I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a point where I'm willing to sell. There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a higher price."

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, I've gone through several rounds of negotiation with Bob and haven't been able to get him to budge.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed $150."
