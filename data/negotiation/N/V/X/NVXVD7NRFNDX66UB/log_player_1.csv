{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets a high starting point, which is advantageous for me as the seller. I'm willing to negotiate down slightly, but I'm not going to let it go for less than $1,200,000. I have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am only able to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $1,100,000. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider your offer at $1,150,000. However, I would like to counter with $1,125,000. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,125,000.  While it's still below my initial target, it's a reasonable compromise.  It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay $1,500,000, so I'm not in a desperate position.  This deal allows me to secure a sale with a reasonable profit while avoiding further negotiation."
