Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a decent profit.  If Bob rejects, I can then consider dropping the price a bit more or switching to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I would like to propose a lower price of $9,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250, reflecting a fair compromise.  This price still allows me to earn a reasonable profit while remaining attractive to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I would like to propose a price of $9,100 for your product. This still offers a good balance between the value to me and the price you're asking. I hope this suggestion will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point.  I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid potentially risking further negotiations.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk missing out on both Bob and John."
