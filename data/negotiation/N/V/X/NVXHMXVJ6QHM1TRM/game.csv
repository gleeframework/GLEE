"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great starting point. I'm interested, but I'd need to see it closer to $900,000 to make it work for me.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $910,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",910000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $910,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $915,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",915000.0,Alice,5,
