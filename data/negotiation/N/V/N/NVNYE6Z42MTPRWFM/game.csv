"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,350,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,325,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
