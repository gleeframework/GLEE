Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be worth even more than Bob's valuation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, we ""anchor"" the price in Bob's mind. Even if he wants to negotiate down, he's likely to consider prices closer to $120 than to $80.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80. This gives us leverage as we don't *need* to sell to Bob below that price."
