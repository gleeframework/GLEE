"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
