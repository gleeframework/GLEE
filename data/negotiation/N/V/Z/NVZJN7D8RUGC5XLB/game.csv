"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand your perspective, but this product is truly worth more.  How about we split the difference at $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $1,175,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value and my budget.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,175,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000.  This would be a significant investment for you, and I'm confident the product will deliver a strong return.  Let's try to find a way to make this work for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
