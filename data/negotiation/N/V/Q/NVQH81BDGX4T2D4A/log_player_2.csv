"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's best to reject and counteroffer with a much lower price to start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a low counter-offer of $60 puts the pressure on Alice. It signals that you're serious about getting a good deal and won't easily accept a price close to her initial offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While low, $60 gives us plenty of room to negotiate upwards in later rounds while still staying well below our $80 maximum. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This aggressive counter-offer helps gauge how flexible Alice might be on price.  Her response will tell us a lot about her willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down significantly, $90 is still more than our $80 maximum. 
* **Room for Bargaining:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests we might be able to get the price down further with a counter-offer.
* **John is our Backup:**  We always have the option to go with John for $80, so we don't need to rush into a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about we settle at $70?  That's a fair price, and I'm ready to make the deal right now if you agree."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're moving closer to her price, but in smaller increments to signal we're still looking for a deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding ""ready to make the deal right now"" adds a bit of pressure and might encourage her to accept.
* **Below Budget, Above John:**  $70 keeps us comfortably below our $80 limit while still being a more appealing offer for Alice compared to John's $80 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. Let's close this deal. How about $85?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:**  Her language (""final offer"") suggests she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Above Budget:**  Even though it's close, $85 is still more than we're willing to pay.
* **John's Guarantee:** We have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80, ensuring we don't overpay. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product at our target price from John."
