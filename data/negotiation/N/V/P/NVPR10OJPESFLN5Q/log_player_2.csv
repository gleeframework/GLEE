# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to discuss selling you this product.  I know its value is significant to you, and I believe it's fairly priced at $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. I want to test the waters and see how much room for negotiation there is.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the unique benefits it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer is still too high for me. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to the price I'm willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to push the price down further. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not willing to pay $1,300,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that the product has unique benefits, but I still think $1,300,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,050,000. Can we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
