"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I need to get closer to $1,800,000 for this product. It represents a significant investment from my end as well.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
