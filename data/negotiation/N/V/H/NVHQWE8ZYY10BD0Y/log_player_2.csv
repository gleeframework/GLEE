"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above your budget of $8,000.  It's better to reject and counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts at the top of my budget range and hopefully sets the stage for a negotiation.  It's a significant price drop from Alice's original offer and is likely to get her attention."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my budget. It's worth rejecting and counteroffering again. I can potentially still get a better price without going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer while still remaining within my comfort zone. It shows a willingness to negotiate further while maintaining my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $10,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $12,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  At this point, I'm better off buying from John for $8,000.  There's a chance Alice might come down further, but it's not worth risking getting stuck at a price above my limit.  I've already made a significant counteroffer, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further."
