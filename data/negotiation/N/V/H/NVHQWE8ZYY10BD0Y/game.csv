"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $10,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $12,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so let me know if that's acceptable to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
