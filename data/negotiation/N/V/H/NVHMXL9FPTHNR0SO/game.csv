"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential and worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $900,000. This reflects the product's true worth and leaves us both with a fair deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
