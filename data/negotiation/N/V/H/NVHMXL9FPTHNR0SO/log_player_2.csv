"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential and worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's opening offer of $950,000 is still quite high, leaving room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $900,000. This reflects the product's true worth and leaves us both with a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $900,000 is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $850,000.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should continue trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we settle on $890,000?  This feels like a good point for both of us to agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to Bob's target price of $850,000.  While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are small.
* **Risk of Buying from John:** If Bob rejects the offer, he risks having Alice counter with a higher price or rejecting his next counteroffer. There's a chance he might end up paying John's asking price of $1,000,000.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, the pressure is increasing.  It's better to lock in a deal that's reasonably close to Bob's target price rather than risk losing out on the product entirely."
