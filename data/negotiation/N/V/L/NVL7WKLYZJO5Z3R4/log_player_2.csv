"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price point. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price. There's no immediate need to buy from John since Alice has shown interest in selling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is still within my budget and is closer to my desired price point. It's a good deal, and it's not worth risking further negotiation, especially with the threat of having to buy from John at a higher price."
