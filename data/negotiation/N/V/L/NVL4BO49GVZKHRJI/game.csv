"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value at that price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,800?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $10,800 is closer, but I need to be a bit higher than that.  Would you consider $11,200? This would give us both a fair deal, and I'd be happy to close the sale today.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? That would be a great price for me and I'm sure we can both agree on that.",11000.0,Bob,6,
