# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can get a better deal, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

You're still closer to your goal price of $12,000, and you have some room to negotiate further with Alice.  It's worth trying to get the price down a bit more."
