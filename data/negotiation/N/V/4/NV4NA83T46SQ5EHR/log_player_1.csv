Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'm aware John will pay $15,000, so I won't settle for less than $14,000. 
* **Potential for Counteroffers:**  I'm open to negotiation but will likely hold firm around the $14,000 mark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $12,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Leveraging John:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $15,000, making me comfortable rejecting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Continuation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise by lowering the price from $14,000 to $13,500.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $13,500 is still a decent profit margin for me and closer to my desired price point.
* **Pressure for Agreement:**  By presenting a counteroffer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to reach an agreement.  If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $13,000.  Let's make this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us. 
* **Value vs. Risk:** While I could potentially get a slightly better price with John, there's a risk that negotiations with Bob could drag on or break down entirely. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
