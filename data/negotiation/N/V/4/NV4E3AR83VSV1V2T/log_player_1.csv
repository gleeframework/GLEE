Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price.  I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a bit too low. I'll try to counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."

Round 5

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is still too low, and we're running out of rounds. I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $10,000."
