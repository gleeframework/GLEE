"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price.  $110 is still too high for my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Alice's offer. $102 is still a decent deal for me, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from her in the next rounds."
