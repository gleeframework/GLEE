"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'd find incredibly valuable. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's still very fair.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's less than what you'd pay John, it still leaves you with a significant loss ($150,000) compared to your maximum value. 
* **Negotiating with Alice is risky.**  You don't have any leverage, and it's unclear if she's willing to budge much.
* **Buying from John is the safer option.**  It guarantees you'll get the product, even if it's at a higher price.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you maintain the option of negotiating with her further, or you can confidently move on to John."
