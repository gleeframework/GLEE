"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000.  It's worth negotiating further with Alice to see if you can get a better deal.  You can always fall back on buying from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is $1,075,000. This is only $75,000 over your target price of $1,000,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's likely to be a drawn-out process with uncertain outcomes.  It's a better risk to accept Alice's offer, as you are getting a good deal and saving time."
