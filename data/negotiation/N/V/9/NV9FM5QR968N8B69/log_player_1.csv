Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
