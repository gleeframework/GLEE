**Reasoning:**

Bob has become very rigid in his offer and has even resorted to a bluff (mentioning John).  He's clearly trying to anchor the price at $900,000.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. Accepting his final offer means losing out on $300,000. It's time to cut negotiations and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
