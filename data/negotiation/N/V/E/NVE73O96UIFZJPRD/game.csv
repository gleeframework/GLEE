"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your aspirations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the potential returns it offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from reaching my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll be getting from the product. I'm eager to move forward with the purchase, but I need to stay within my means.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see that we're getting closer.  I'm willing to make one final concession to seal this deal.  Let's agree on $975,000, and we'll call it a win-win.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and your budget.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not quite there. I'd like to propose a price of $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. I've already considered buying from John, and I'd prefer to close the deal with you if we can agree on a price.",900000.0,Bob,6,
