"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product. We're excited to work with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still significantly above the product's value to Alice. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if a lower price can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, while also providing you with a healthy profit margin."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating our pricing strategy, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're now offering the product to you at a price of $875,000. This price still reflects the product's value to us, but we're willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $875,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference - $862,500. This price allows us both to secure a good deal."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer. However, we're still not willing to go below $880,000. We're willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. We're now offering the product to you at a price of $880,000. This price is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is getting very close to Bob's target price. While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for Bob while also avoiding the higher price from John."
