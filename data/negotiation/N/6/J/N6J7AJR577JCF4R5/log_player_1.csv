Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Aiming for a price close to that maximizes potential profit.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. We don't want to go below this price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, we encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above our minimum."
