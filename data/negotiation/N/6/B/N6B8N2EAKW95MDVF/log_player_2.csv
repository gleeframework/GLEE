"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer of $1,200,000, Bob can potentially get a better price. There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate with Alice, allowing for more potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's intent to save money. However, it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Provides a reason:**  Bob highlights the value he sees in the product to justify his counteroffer.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** Bob doesn't go for the absolute lowest price, leaving space for Alice to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  While the product offers immense value, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground. How about $1,110,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,110,000 is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation.  It's beneficial to continue the process and see if Alice is willing to go lower.  With 7 rounds remaining, Bob can continue to attempt to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product,  $1,110,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,080,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1080000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental progress:** This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Maintain focus on value:** Bob reminds Alice of the value he sees in the product, justifying his counteroffer.
* **Express willingness to compromise:** The phrase ""Let's see if we can find a compromise"" conveys Bob's desire to reach an agreement while still asserting his negotiation stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Further negotiation may not be fruitful.
* **Good deal:**  $1,100,000 is a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Limited time:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to pay John's higher price is increasing. 

It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
