"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  The offer to John for $1,000,000 serves as a strong safety net. We wouldn't accept anything less than that unless we're in the final rounds and haven't reached a deal with Bob. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and expressing a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, but Room to Negotiate:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above our absolute minimum ($1,000,000), but it's still significantly below his perceived value and our initial asking price. 
* **Early Stage:** It's only Round 2, so we have time to negotiate. Accepting now would leave a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer and providing a counteroffer, we can demonstrate flexibility while guiding the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  While the product offers immense value, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground. How about $1,110,000?"",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are moving closer to Bob's offer, but not by a huge amount.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:** The phrase ""meet you closer to the middle ground"" frames the concession as a fair compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** We are still reiterating the product's high value to justify the relatively high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product,  $1,110,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,080,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer is increasing, but very slowly. We need to signal that larger concessions are necessary to reach a deal.
* **Time Consideration:**  We are now in Round 4. While we have time, continuing to make small concessions might lead us to a point where we have to accept an offer below what we could achieve with more assertive negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:**  The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 gives us leverage. Bob doesn't know how many other offers we have, so we can use this to our advantage."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** We're making a smaller concession this round ($10,000) and declaring it our final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and signals that we're reaching our limit. 
* **Justification:**  We're not simply saying ""no"" to his offer. We're emphasizing the product's value again to remind him why we're holding firm.
* **Calculated Risk:**  By making a final offer, we risk Bob walking away. However, it's a calculated risk because:
    * We're still offering a price significantly above our fallback option (John at $1,000,000). 
    * It's possible Bob is trying to see how low we'll go, and this firm stance might push him to agree. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation, so it's a good time to try and push for a close."
