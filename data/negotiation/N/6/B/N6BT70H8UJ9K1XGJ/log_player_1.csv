Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $20,000 sets a high starting point for negotiations. This allows for potential room to bargain down while still exceeding your minimum value of $15,000.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to create a good first impression and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob helps pique his interest and sets the stage for potential benefits he could receive from purchasing it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""Let me know what you think,"" you invite Bob to engage in a discussion and potentially counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. You will need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response and your own risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $20000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than your minimum value of $15,000.  Accepting it would mean losing money. Selling to John for $15,000 is also a better option at this point. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain the opportunity to negotiate further.  It allows you to explore whether Bob is genuinely interested in the product and might be willing to increase his offer, while also keeping the option to sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This counter-offer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the value of the product and providing a reason for the price helps Bob understand your perspective.
* **Compromise:**  The reduced price shows that you're flexible and willing to find a middle ground. 
* **Open-Ended:**  Ending with ""Let's see if we can find some common ground"" keeps the conversation open for further discussion. 

By making this counter-offer, you signal to Bob that you are serious about selling the product but also that you are not willing to settle for a price that is below your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're holding out for a good price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $17500 is still a bit steep for me, but I'm willing to pay $14000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum price of $15,000. While it's getting closer, it's not a good enough deal for me to accept.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. It's the most reliable and financially sound option at this point."
