"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits we've both discussed. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too far from my expectations.  I'm confident this product can bring significant value to your operations, even more than you currently anticipate. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I'm placing on the product. I'm confident this price reflects the potential benefits we've discussed and is a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your perspective on the value, but to be frank, $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the true potential this product offers. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings to both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant investment for me, and represents a substantial compromise from my initial offer. I'm confident this price reflects the value we both see in the product and allows us to move forward with the sale.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
