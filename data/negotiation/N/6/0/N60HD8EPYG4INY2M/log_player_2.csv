Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your perspective on the value, but to be frank, $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the true potential this product offers. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000.  I'll make one more counteroffer before I consider going to John."
