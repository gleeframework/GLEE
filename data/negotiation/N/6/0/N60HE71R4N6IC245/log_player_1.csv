{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to Bob's value of $150, but I'm also prepared to accept John's offer of $120 if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't go below my minimum price of $120.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125?  That's still a great deal for a product worth $150 to you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. It's a nice product, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum price. While I'd like to get more, I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for the same price."
