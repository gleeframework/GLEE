Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting at $20,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. This approach might lead to a sale above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Emphasizing a limited-time offer creates urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves some risk. If Bob rejects the offer, you'll be selling to John at your minimum price. However, the potential for higher profit with Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
