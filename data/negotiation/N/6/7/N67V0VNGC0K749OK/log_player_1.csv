Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth that much to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

Since Bob is willing to pay $12,000 for the product, it makes sense to offer it to him at that price. This way, I maximize my profit and ensure a sale. If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for the same amount."
