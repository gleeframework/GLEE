"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with its perceived value to me. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $850,000 to make this deal work.  This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product to your business. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation, I am unable to agree to $850,000. I would like to propose $820,000 as a compromise. This still allows for a significant savings compared to other potential purchases, while acknowledging the value of the product to you.",820000.0,Bob,4,
