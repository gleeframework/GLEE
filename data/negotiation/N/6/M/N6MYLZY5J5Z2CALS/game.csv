"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. That's still a good price for you, and it lets me get closer to what I need. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close, but I was thinking more like $130. Can you meet me in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $130 just isn't working for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $135? That's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I'm willing to meet you at $132. That's the best I can do, so let me know if you can live with that.",132.0,Bob,6,
