``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit. I'm also being friendly and confident to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. That's still a good price for you, and it lets me get closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more like $130. Can you meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm willing to risk losing this deal to potentially get a better price from Bob or to sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $130 just isn't working for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $135? That's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I'm willing to meet you at $132. That's the best I can do, so let me know if you can live with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although $132 is close to my minimum, I'm going to sell to John for $150.  Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I don't want to risk him walking away, and I don't want to spend more time negotiating.  John is a guaranteed sale at a better price than Bob is currently offering."
