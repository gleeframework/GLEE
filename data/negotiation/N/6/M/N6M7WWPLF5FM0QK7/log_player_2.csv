"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.
