{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $15,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate.  
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob might make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for further negotiation, allowing Bob to counteroffer if needed. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adapt my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide:
    * **Accept his counteroffer:**  If it's close to my minimum or I feel it's a good deal.
    * **Counteroffer:**  I'll adjust my price, trying to find a mutually acceptable solution.
    * **Sell to John:**  If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll sell to John for $10,000 to ensure I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $15000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Room:** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This means I have room to counter and potentially reach a more favorable deal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and might convince him to come up in price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise somewhere between $12,000 and $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000), showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain Value:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's value to justify the price, even though it's lower than my initial ask. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message encourages further discussion, leaving the door open for Bob to potentially counter again.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly:

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great, I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll consider selling to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low. If there's still potential for a deal with Bob, I'll counter again, but I'll be more cautious with price adjustments."
