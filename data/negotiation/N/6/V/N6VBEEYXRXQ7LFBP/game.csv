"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $102? It's a small step up from your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
