# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,250,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,175,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,175,000, which would be $1,212,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a final offer at this price.

This is a good deal for Bob. It's unlikely he'll get Alice much lower, and this price is significantly better than John's $1,500,000 offer."
