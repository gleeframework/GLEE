"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,250,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is still a little too high for me, how about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,175,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,175,000, which would be $1,212,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a final offer at this price.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
