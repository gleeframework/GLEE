"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than what John is asking, it's still a significant amount. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now $900,000.** This is closer to Bob's desired price point and significantly lower than what John is offering. 
* **Bob has saved $100,000 compared to John's offer.** While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are smaller, and the risk of losing the deal to John increases. 
* **Accepting the offer ensures a purchase at a good price.**  It's a calculated decision to secure the product at a reasonable cost rather than potentially risking a longer negotiation and a higher price."
