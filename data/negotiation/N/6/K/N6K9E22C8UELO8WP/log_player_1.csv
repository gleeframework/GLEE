Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
