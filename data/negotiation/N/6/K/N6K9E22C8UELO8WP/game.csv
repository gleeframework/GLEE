"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $925,000, which is $75,000 more than your offer. This still leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $925,000 is still a bit more than I can justify.  Let's split the difference and agree on $887,500.  I believe this would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $887,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $906,250. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me.",906250.0,Alice,5,
