"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, so there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $925,000, which is $75,000 more than your offer. This still leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still too high for me.  While it's closer to my ideal price, it's still $125,000 over what I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get her closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $925,000 is still a bit more than I can justify.  Let's split the difference and agree on $887,500.  I believe this would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $887,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $906,250. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $906,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $906,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $906,250 is still too high for me.  I'm not willing to pay that much.  I have 5 rounds left, and I don't think I can negotiate her down any further. It's better to just buy from John at $800,000 and save myself the time and hassle."
