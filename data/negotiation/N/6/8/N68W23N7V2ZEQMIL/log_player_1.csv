"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This way I can potentially earn more while still leaving space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I'd like to avoid selling to John for $120, I'm not willing to settle for a loss. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
I'm offering $130, which is closer to my minimum price and allows for potential negotiation in future rounds. I'm also trying to emphasize the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $120? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum price. I'm happy to accept and avoid selling to John for the same price."
