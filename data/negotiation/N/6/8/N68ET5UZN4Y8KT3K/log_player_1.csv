"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Opening high:** I'm starting at a price higher than my minimum acceptable value, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and assertive:** The message is friendly but assertive, highlighting the value of the product and setting the stage for a potentially successful negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets a high bar and allows me to gauge Bob's interest while leaving room for counteroffers. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response, considering my minimum acceptable price and the possibility of selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my desired price, and I'm still within the early rounds of negotiation.  While $900,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it's below my minimum acceptable price. There's still room to negotiate and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price that is closer to my desired value but still reflects the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. I want to continue negotiations, but I'll keep my minimum acceptable price and the option to sell to John in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still offers you a great deal, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway from my previous offer of $1,750,000 towards Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows willingness to negotiate but maintains a price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that even at $1,300,000, it's a good deal. This underscores the potential for a win-win situation. 
* **Open to discussion:** I end with a question, inviting further discussion and showing that I'm still open to finding a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping to strike a balance between moving closer to Bob's price while maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while also ensuring I don't undervalue the product too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1300000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I want to close the deal, I cannot afford to accept an offer so far below my minimum. It's important to hold firm to my minimum value to ensure I get a fair return for my product. 

**Strategy:**

While it's getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, I will continue to hold firm on my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer again in the next round with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value. This will hopefully encourage Bob to come up to a more reasonable price.  I'll keep the option to sell to John in mind if I cannot reach an agreement with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,050,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. How about $1,200,000? This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again demonstrating willingness to compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still significantly above his last offer. 
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I emphasize that $1,200,000 is a good price for both of us, highlighting the win-win potential.
* **Urgency:**  The message adds a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""make it happen,"" subtly pushing Bob towards a decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm keeping the negotiation moving while ensuring that the final price is close to my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my price, but I'm prepared to consider selling to John if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not going to go any higher. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stubbornly refused to budge from his $1,050,000 offer, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to undervalue my product. I've already compromised several times, and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement. 

**Strategy:**

With only a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I receive a fair price for my product, I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John."
