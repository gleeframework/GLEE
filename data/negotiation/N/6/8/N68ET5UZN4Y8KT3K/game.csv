"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $900000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This price still offers you a great deal, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1300000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1050000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. How about $1200000? This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
