Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets the product for $100,000 less than its value to him, while Alice earns a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message hints at the product's desirability and Bob's potential loss if he rejects the offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
