"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $130?  That feels like a fair compromise.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $145. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",145.0,Alice,5,
