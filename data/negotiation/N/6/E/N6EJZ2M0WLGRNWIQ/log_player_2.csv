"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's asking price and even less than my maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** Maintaining a positive tone is important to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Clear Counter:** Offering a specific price avoids ambiguity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $160 is still more than I'm willing to spend.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are several rounds left, suggesting Alice might be willing to negotiate further. 
* **John's Price in Mind:** I know I have a backup option at $150, so I'm comfortable pushing for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $130?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  I'm raising my offer slightly from $110 to show willingness to move, but not too much. 
* **Targeting a Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price roughly between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, hoping for a compromise.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** Keeping the tone friendly encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $145. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Signal:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, suggesting she is unlikely to go lower.
* **Close Enough:** $145 is only $5 above John's price, a relatively small difference.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could make Alice walk away, forcing me to buy from John at the higher price anyway."
