"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, the $1,200,000 offer is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to my minimum. I propose $1,900,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances your minimum and my budget constraints.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
