"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer, or you can proceed to buy from John at your desired price."
