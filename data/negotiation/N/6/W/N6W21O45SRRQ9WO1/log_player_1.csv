Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $100, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above our Minimum:**  Importantly, even if Bob rejects this offer, we are guaranteed to sell it to John for $150. This strategy ensures we never sell below our minimum acceptable price."
