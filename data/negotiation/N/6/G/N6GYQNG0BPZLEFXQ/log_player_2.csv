Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I can offer you $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,250. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

Bob has reached his limit. While Alice has come down to $10,250, Bob is unwilling to pay more than $10,000. He's better off buying from John at this point."
