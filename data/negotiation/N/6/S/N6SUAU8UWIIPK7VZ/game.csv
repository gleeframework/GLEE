"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a competitive price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
