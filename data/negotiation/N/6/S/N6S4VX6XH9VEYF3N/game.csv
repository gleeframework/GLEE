"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Considering your value of $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a fair price, but I'm not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
