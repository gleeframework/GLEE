"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is more than his maximum budget of $10,000. He can get the product from John for a lower price, so it's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice to try and get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000.  He should continue negotiating with Alice, as there's still potential to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to offer you $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John, securing a lower price and ensuring he stays within his budget.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a better price, but it's not guaranteed, and the risk of exceeding his budget is too high."
