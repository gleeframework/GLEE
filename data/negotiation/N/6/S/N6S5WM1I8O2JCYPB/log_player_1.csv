Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I'm confident in its worth and have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer the product to Bob for $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for negotiation while still exceeding John's offer, ensuring Alice doesn't lose money.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the initial offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without directly revealing its worth to John."
