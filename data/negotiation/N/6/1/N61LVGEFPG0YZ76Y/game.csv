"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,115.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $112.50. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. How about $107.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.",107.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"Hi Bob, I see you're really pushing for a good deal! I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $109? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",109.0,Alice,5,,
