The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $110. You can likely get it for less.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $112.50. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

Alice is moving closer to your price point, but $112.50 is still a bit high. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. How about $107.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're really pushing for a good deal! I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $109? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $109, which is only $9 more than what the product is worth to her.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it's still within your budget of $120."
