"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly lower to make sense for me. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 was a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could potentially do $7,000. Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 was still a bit high for you, and $7,000 is a good compromise. However, I'm still not at my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $10,000, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
