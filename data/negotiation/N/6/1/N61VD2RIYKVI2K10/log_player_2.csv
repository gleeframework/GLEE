"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's important to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly lower to make sense for me. How about $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is a very low counteroffer, it leaves a lot of room for negotiation and helps you understand Alice's flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, you are setting a price anchor. This might encourage Alice to make more significant concessions later.
* **Expressing Interest:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer but makes it clear that a much lower price is necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 was a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down a bit, $10,000 is still too high for your budget. You have some bargaining power, as you have the option to buy from John for $8,000. Let's see if you can negotiate Alice closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could potentially do $7,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** Your counteroffer of $7,000 shows Alice you're willing to negotiate upwards, but you're still aiming for a price below your maximum.
* **Staying Firm:** You're staying firm below your $8,000 walk-away point, which is essential in negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** There's still a small margin for negotiation if Alice completely rejects $7,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 was still a bit high for you, and $7,000 is a good compromise. However, I'm still not at my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $10,000, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her offer of $8,500 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. At this point, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at your target price, so it makes more sense to take that deal."
