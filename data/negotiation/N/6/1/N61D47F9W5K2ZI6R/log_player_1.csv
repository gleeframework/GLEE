I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value and allows for potential negotiation. I believe this price is attractive enough to encourage Bob to engage in a discussion but also leaves room for me to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's significantly less than my minimum value and doesn't even come close to what I believe the product is worth.  I need to counteroffer to try and get closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is my absolute minimum, as anything lower would be less than my guaranteed value with John.  I'm hoping this price is high enough to entice Bob while still being fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price from John, so I'm going to sell to him instead."
