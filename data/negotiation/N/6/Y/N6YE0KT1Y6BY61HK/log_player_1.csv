Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking $1,150,000.  I believe this price reflects its worth, while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this price is still fair considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe I can negotiate a higher price.  Selling to John at this point would only yield $1,000,000, while I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $1,150,000 through further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth considerably more, and I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment for you. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,050,000? This price acknowledges the value you see, while also allowing me to meet my minimum requirements. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1025000? This price takes into account the value you see in the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's still lower than my ideal price,  the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John makes accepting this offer a better choice."
