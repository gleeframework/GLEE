Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $120 for this product. I'd much rather work out a deal with you, but I need to be realistic about its value. Could you do $100?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $85 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, this is my final offer â€“ how about $95 and we close the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm and it's unlikely she'll go below $95. You have a reliable alternative at $80 from John.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
