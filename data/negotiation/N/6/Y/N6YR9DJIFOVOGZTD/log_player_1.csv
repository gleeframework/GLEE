"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a price significantly higher than our minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, creating a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""to start"" implies flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $60 would be fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $60 is far below our minimum of $120. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. We can use the remaining rounds to negotiate towards a more agreeable price. 
* **Backup Option:**  We still have the option to sell to John for our minimum price, so we're not desperate to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** We start by acknowledging Bob's offer and showing understanding, maintaining a positive tone.
* **Firm but Fair:**  We politely reiterate that $60 is too low while suggesting a price ($110) that is closer to our minimum and a significant move from our initial offer. 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  By proposing a price in the middle, we signal our willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, $75 remains significantly below our $120 minimum. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob's counteroffers suggest he's willing to negotiate, but we need to show we're firm on a price closer to our minimum.
* **John as Leverage:** We can use the option of selling to John as leverage.  Bob needs to understand that we have alternative options if an agreement can't be reached."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $120 for this product. I'd much rather work out a deal with you, but I need to be realistic about its value. Could you do $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Leverage:**  We subtly bring in the offer from John, establishing a firm bottom line for Bob without being overly aggressive.
* **Expressing Preference for Bob:** We reinforce our desire to close the deal with Bob, fostering a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Final Concession:** We make a smaller concession ($10 from our last offer), signaling that we're nearing our limit.  
* **Clear Expectation:**  By proposing $100, we're aiming for a price that's a compromise for both parties but still above our absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have other offers, Alice, but I also have a budget I need to stick to. How about we settle at $85? That's a fair price considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to a price we might consider. However, it's still below our $100 target and significantly under the $120 we could get from John.
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** We need to determine if Bob is willing to go any higher. Rejecting this offer might encourage him to make his final and best offer.
* **Time Consideration:** We have four rounds left. While we could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob, we need to weigh that against the certainty of selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $85 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, this is my final offer â€“ how about $95 and we close the deal?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We are making it clear that this is our final offer to encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Slight Concession:** We are coming down slightly from our previous offer of $100 to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet us halfway. 
* **Time Pressure:** By stating this is our final offer, we are subtly introducing time pressure.  Bob has fewer rounds to make a decision, and we have the attractive alternative of selling to John.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** $95 is a price point where we are still making a reasonable profit, and we are reducing the risk of Bob walking away and forcing us to accept John's offer at the last minute."
