# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $10000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you making an offer. $7500 is a little lower than I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and I come down to $8750? This would still be a great deal for you, and it works for me. Let me know your thoughts!

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from $10,000 to $8,750, which is a good start, but still higher than my ideal price of $7,500. I'll continue to try and negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
