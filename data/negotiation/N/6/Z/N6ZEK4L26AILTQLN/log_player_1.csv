I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a higher price, especially since I can always sell to John for $12,000. I will try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway."

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's final offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John.  I want to maximize my profit, and selling to John ensures that."
