"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves room for a profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not sure $1,350,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Would you consider $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,225,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000. Would you consider $1,300,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a profitable deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
