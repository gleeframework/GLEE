"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good return while ensuring I stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, which still gives you a great value.  This is my final offer before I move on to other interested parties.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
