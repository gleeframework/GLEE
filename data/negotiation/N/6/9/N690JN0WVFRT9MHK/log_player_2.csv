"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's valued at $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My asking price is $1,000,000.  This price reflects the product's high quality and potential.  Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and she's asking for $1,000,000. Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, and it's within Bob's budget. Accepting the offer saves Bob $250,000."
