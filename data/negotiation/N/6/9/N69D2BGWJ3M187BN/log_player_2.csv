"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a great deal to you, given its potential value. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. It's a fair price that allows you a healthy margin while ensuring a good return for me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's a significant difference between Alice's value ($800,000) and her offer ($1,200,000), indicating room for negotiation.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer closer to Alice's value and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This would still give you a healthy profit while allowing me a comfortable margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still gives her a substantial profit margin.  It's a good starting point for further negotiation, aiming to find a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return.  How about $1,050,000? This price still allows you a significant profit margin, and it's a much more reasonable starting point for us to work from. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his desired range.  While buying from John for $1,500,000 is an option, it's not the most cost-effective choice at this point."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000? This would give us both a good deal and allow us to move forward quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. Offering $1,000,000 allows him to save more than $50,000 compared to Alice's last offer, while still offering her a significant profit. This counteroffer is reasonable and likely to be accepted."
