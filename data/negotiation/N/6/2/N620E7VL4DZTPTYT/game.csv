"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $950,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,2,
