Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still $500 of potential profit for Bob to gain, incentivizing him to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer.
* **It demonstrates you're willing to negotiate:**  Starting with a lower price than Bob's perceived value shows you're open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is a decent price, it's still lower than my minimum desired profit margin.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a better deal.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $11,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $10,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $10,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer because:

* **It's close to my minimum:** I'll still make a profit, albeit a smaller one.
* **Negotiation time:**  Further negotiations with Bob might take more time and effort.  
* **Risk of John:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for a lower price.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and can move on to other opportunities."
