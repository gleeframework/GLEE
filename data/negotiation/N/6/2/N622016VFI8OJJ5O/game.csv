"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs. How about we meet at $112.50? This is as low as I can go without losing money.",112.5,Alice,5,
