"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
