"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, but Alice's offer is $950,000. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer opens up the opportunity for counteroffers.** You can try to lower the price and potentially get a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  It's good to know you have an alternative, but it's not the most cost-effective option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget:** This counteroffer is still within your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Lowering the price significantly:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your serious interest in buying the product while still securing a good deal.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  The message expresses your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your preferred price.** You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice's new offer is $900,000. There is still room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation.** By continuing to negotiate, you have the chance to potentially secure a lower price, saving more money.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.** It's good to have this alternative available, but it's not the most cost-effective option at this point.

**Next Step:** You should send a counteroffer to Alice again, aiming to bridge the gap between her offer and your preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between Alice's offer of $900,000 and your previous offer of $850,000. It shows your willingness to compromise.
* **Still within your budget:**  $875,000 is still within your maximum budget of $1,000,000, ensuring a profitable purchase.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** The message is friendly and encourages a collaborative approach to finding a solution.

This counteroffer attempts to strike a balance between securing a good deal and avoiding a stalemate in the negotiation."
