{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a significant step closer to your previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1075000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Price:** Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is only $75,000 lower than John's price.  
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  Alice has made it clear that $1,075,000 is her bottom line. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly lower price.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice is high. 

**Conclusion:** Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the safest and most cost-effective option. This ensures a deal within Bob's budget and leaves no risk of further negotiation complications."
