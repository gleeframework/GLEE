Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see value in.  I think a price of $1,100,000 is fair for both of us, considering its unique benefits. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible (my minimum acceptable price).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it significantly lower than my ""backup"" price from John makes it more appealing to him.
* **Confidence and Justification:**  The message implies the product is worth the asking price, potentially swaying Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value while still remaining attractive enough for him to accept."
