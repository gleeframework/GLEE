"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice for $120 is the best option.** You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $120. This means you'll save $30 compared to buying from John. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John would cost you $150.** This is the most expensive option."
