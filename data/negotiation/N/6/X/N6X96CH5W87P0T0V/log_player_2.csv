You can do better than $120. It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $110. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

You are still $15 below your maximum price and Alice is showing willingness to negotiate. It's worth trying to push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a bit of a discount, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum price. How about we meet at $112? It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've come down to $112, which is still a good deal for you and only $2 away from your counteroffer. It's likely that further negotiation won't bring you much closer to your ideal price, so accepting the offer is the best option here."
