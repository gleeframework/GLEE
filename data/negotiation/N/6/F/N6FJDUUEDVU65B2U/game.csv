"That's a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. It's a great price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand we're close, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really trying to stick to my budget, and $13,500 is still a little too high.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $13,000.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with John's offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make one final compromise - I'll meet you at $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let me know!",13500.0,Alice,7,
