"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to offer $700,000 to start.  I believe that's a fair price reflecting its worth to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $750,000? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this price is a win-win for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $795,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",795000.0,Alice,5,
