Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my last offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $8,200 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,600? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize this transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8600}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,400, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my initial asking price, it's only $200 less than my minimum, and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's better than selling to John for $8,000, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
