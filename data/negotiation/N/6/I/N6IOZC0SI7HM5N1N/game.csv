"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would give us both a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to make another offer of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,800 is still not enough for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $11,400? This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to reach an agreement.",11400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer of $10,900. This is as low as I can go, but I really need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $10,900 is your limit, but I need to at least make $11,200.  If you're willing to go up to $11,200, we can finalize this deal now.  Otherwise, we might have to call it off.  I don't want to waste either of our time.",11200.0,Alice,7,
