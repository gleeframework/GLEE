"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've placed on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $975,000. Can we compromise on that?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
