"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000.  This would still leave you with a significant profit and allow me to stay within my budget.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget constraints while also allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
