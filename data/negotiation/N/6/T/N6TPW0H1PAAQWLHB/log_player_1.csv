Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000.  This would still leave you with a significant profit and allow me to stay within my budget.  What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
