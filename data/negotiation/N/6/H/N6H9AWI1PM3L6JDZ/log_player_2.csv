"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. This offer represents a significant discount from its true worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob might:

* **Prompt a counter-offer:**  Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale.
* **Increase bargaining power:**  Rejecting the initial offer signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal.

Bob's worst-case scenario is having to buy from John at $1,200,000, which is the same outcome if he doesn't negotiate at all."
