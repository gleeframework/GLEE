"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and focuses on the value Bob will receive. 
* **Room for counteroffers:**  I've left enough room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation is key:** While $130 is close to my minimum, it's still worth trying to get a bit closer to my initial target price. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round.
* **Risk assessment:**  Selling to John for $120 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a compromise, coming down from my initial price but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterating value:** I remind Bob of the value he'll get from the product, emphasizing that the price is fair. 
* **Positive tone:** My message remains positive and encourages a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to target:**  $132 is very close to my initial target price of $135, and significantly better than selling to John for $120. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:** After several rounds of negotiation, it's likely Bob is also getting tired, and may be less willing to continue haggling. 
* **Risk vs. reward:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high at this point. Accepting Bob's offer secures a good price and allows me to move on."
