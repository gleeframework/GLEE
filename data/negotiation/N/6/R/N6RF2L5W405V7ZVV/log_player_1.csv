Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your minimum:** You need to make at least $120 from the sale.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he would be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Maximizing profit:**  By offering the product at $140, you are aiming for a price close to Bob's maximum while still ensuring a significant profit for yourself. 

This strategy balances your desire for profit with a price that's likely attractive to Bob."
