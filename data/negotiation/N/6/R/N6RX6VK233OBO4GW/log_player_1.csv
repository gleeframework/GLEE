I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a good profit, but I also want to make sure Bob doesn't walk away immediately. We'll see how he responds!"

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

$1,000,000 is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell it that cheaply. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still holding out for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

Bob is offering my minimum price, and I can't do any better with John.  I'll accept the offer and sell the product to Bob."
