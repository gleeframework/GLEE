I'm going to try to get a bit more than Bob's initial offer, but I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $150."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell to John. While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, it seems like he's really firm on $150. Since I can get the same amount from John, I'm going to go with the certainty of a sale."
