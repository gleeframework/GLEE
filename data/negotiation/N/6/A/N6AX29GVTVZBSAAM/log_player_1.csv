Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is higher than his valuation but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is higher than his initial valuation, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise from my previous offer and still higher than his offer, but it shows my willingness to negotiate. This price is closer to my minimum acceptable price and also provides room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my price. Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $120, ensuring I receive my minimum desired profit."
