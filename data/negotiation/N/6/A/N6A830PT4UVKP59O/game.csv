"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm also looking to save some money. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're getting close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11250. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the purchase.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're making a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $11000. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll sell the product to you for $11200. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",11200.0,Alice,7,
