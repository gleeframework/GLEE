"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,
