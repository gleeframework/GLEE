"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my desired price range.  I can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's a significant difference between her asking price and my maximum value ($1,200,000), so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to John at $1,200,000 is too high.  Accepting this offer means I save $250,000 compared to buying from John."
