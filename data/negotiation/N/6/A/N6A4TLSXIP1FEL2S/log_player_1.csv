Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its true worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know John provides a guaranteed $1,500,000. Our goal is to see if we can get more from Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  We need to offer a price attractive to him but above his valuation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's:
    * Substantially higher than Bob's valuation, giving us room to negotiate if needed.
    * Still significantly below John's offer, ensuring we're maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Messaging:**  The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fantastic deal"" to make the offer more appealing."
