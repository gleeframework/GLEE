Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to see if we can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,250,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little further in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable deal.  Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
