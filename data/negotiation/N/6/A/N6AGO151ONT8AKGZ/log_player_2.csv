"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. I know this would be a valuable asset to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her ($1,500,000), it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option for Bob."
