Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $8,000. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 provides a strong fallback.

By offering the product at a price slightly below John's offer, Alice creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. While the price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can proceed with selling to John at her desired price."
