"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for this great product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $11,000? That's a reasonable price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like that you're willing to meet me at $11,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
