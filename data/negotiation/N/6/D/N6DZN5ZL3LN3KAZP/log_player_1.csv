"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, hopefully reaching a point where Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and we are only in round 4.  Accepting his offer at $13,000 secures a good profit and allows me to avoid potentially wasting more rounds haggling."
