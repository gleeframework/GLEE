"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to your business. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's still very attractive. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from what I could potentially get elsewhere, but I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can move to buying from John at a much better price."
