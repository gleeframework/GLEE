Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $92. It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it. What do you think?

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to come down to $80, and you've already gotten her close to your limit. John offers a sure thing at your target price, so it's the best option at this point."
