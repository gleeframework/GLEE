"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $700,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
