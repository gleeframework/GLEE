Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500, Bob. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $8,250 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $8,250.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's risky. We know we can get the product for $8,000 from John, ensuring we don't overpay.  It's time to cut our losses with Alice and go with the guaranteed deal."
