"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000, which is a one-time offer. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a much better deal. How about we start around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $8,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $18,000 is still too far from what I had in mind.  To be honest, anything above $10,000 isn't going to work for me.  I could do $9,000 as my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you a deal at $18,000, which is the lowest I can go. Your final offer of $9,000 is not acceptable. I'm willing to make one last offer: $16,000. This is the absolute minimum I can do, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",16000.0,Alice,5,
