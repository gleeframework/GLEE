{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is way above your budget ($17,000 vs your $10,000 limit). 
* It's definitely worth trying to negotiate with Alice. 
* There are 10 rounds, so you have time to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000.  
* This is a bold move, but I have 10 rounds, so there's room for negotiation.
* If Alice rejects, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than my budget of $10,000, but it's getting closer. 
* I'm still willing to negotiate and see if I can get a better price.
* There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, so I'm raising my counteroffer to $12,000. 
* This is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her offer of $14,000 and my previous offer of $10,000. 
* I believe this is a reasonable offer, and Alice might be willing to accept it, especially with 6 rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. 
* I'm still hoping to get a better price, and I have 5 rounds left to negotiate.

* I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $12,500, aiming to find a middle ground.
* With only 4 rounds left, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept.
* This offer is still within my range and shows I'm willing to be flexible."
