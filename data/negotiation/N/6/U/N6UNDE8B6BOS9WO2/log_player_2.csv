# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away. This might make her offer a lower price to avoid losing the sale. Even if she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000."
