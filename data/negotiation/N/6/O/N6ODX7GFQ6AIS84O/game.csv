"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your asking price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm open to negotiations and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value and my minimum selling price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to demonstrate my commitment to a successful deal. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this exceptional product. Let's find a common ground and make this happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
