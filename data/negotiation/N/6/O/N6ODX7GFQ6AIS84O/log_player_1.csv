Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your asking price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm open to negotiations and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell, his offer is too low. I'm confident we can negotiate a better price, and I still have 8 rounds to do so."

Let's find a common ground and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob has offered my minimum price, and it's a fair deal for both of us. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and keeps the negotiation process from dragging on."
