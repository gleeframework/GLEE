Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start with a strong position. Offering it slightly below that at $950,000 creates the perception of a deal for Bob while maximizing your potential profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential desire for a valuable asset.
* **Direct Approach:** The message directly presents the offer without beating around the bush, creating a sense of confidence and urgency. 

This approach aims to either:

1. **Secure a Deal with Bob:**  If Bob values the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the perceived value outweighs the price difference, he might accept.
2. **Establish a Strong Negotiating Position:** If Bob counters, you have room to negotiate down towards his perceived value ($800,000) while still staying above your minimum. 

Remember, you always have John as a backup, ensuring you won't settle for anything less than $1,000,000."
