"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is significantly higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is tempting, but it's still a significant amount of money. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice is willing to come down further, especially if she's genuinely motivated to sell."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900000. This is a fair price, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for a higher price than I'm comfortable with. While $900,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still close to my maximum budget. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get her down to a price closer to my initial counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $875000. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd love to get the product for my initial counteroffer of $800,000, Alice has come down significantly from her initial price of $950,000.  $875,000 is a good compromise, and it's still within my budget.  If I reject this offer, I risk Alice walking away or going back to her original price, and I'd likely have to buy from John at a higher cost.  This is a good deal for both of us."
