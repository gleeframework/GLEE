"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price of $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100. How about we try $95? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product!",95.0,Alice,3,
