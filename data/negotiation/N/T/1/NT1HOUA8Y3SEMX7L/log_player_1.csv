"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:** I'm confident the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's aggressive:**  By starting high, I establish a strong position and leave more room for potential concessions.

I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not overly concerned about rejecting counteroffers if they're too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,600,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price. I'm not yet worried about running out of rounds, as I still have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe it's a reasonable price that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,700,000. While I would have preferred a higher price, I believe it's a good deal considering:

* **It's above my minimum:** I'm comfortable with this price as it surpasses my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **It's a fair compromise:** This price represents a good compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **It's getting close to the end:** We are already in round 4, and continuing to negotiate could risk me losing Bob as a buyer and potentially not getting a better offer from him.

I believe this is a good opportunity to close the deal and secure a decent profit."
