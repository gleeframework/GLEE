"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $105 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $105. Would you be willing to consider $108? It's a bit closer to your asking price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.",108.0,Bob,4,
