"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting a fair compromise. This remains a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still a significant distance from where we need to be.  I'm willing to go a little lower to $1,450,000. This price is still very fair given the product's value, and I'm confident it's a deal that will work out well for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
