"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? This is still a great price considering the value of the product to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,875.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it also allows me to make a profit.  What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,
