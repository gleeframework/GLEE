{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  This is a great price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. $10,500 is still a bit too low, and I have some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? This is still a great price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,750 is tempting, I'm going to hold out for a little bit longer. I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price before I settle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,875.
