Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. How about we settle at $1,080,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.
