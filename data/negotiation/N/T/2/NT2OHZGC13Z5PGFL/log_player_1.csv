Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. How about we settle at $1,080,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1080000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,080,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,020,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is negotiating, continuing to go back and forth risks leaving me with a less favorable outcome. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John now."
