"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. How about we settle at $1,080,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,080,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,020,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",1020000.0,Bob,4,
