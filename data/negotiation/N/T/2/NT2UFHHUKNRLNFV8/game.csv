"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I had budgeted. I'm interested in exploring a deal, but I would need the price to be closer to $700,000 for it to make sense for me.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's true worth and the value it can bring to your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still too high for me.  To be transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to, and I can go as high as $800,000.  That's a firm offer. If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand budget constraints are real, and I respect your position.  Let's make this work - I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,650,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and it reflects my strong interest in partnering with you. What do you say?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
