"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that's significantly above your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement"" signals your willingness to negotiate and find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I had budgeted. I'm interested in exploring a deal, but I would need the price to be closer to $700,000 for it to make sense for me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While his counter was expected, accepting $700,000 would be selling the product for far less than it's worth to you. It's time to start working your way down strategically while still aiming for a much higher final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's true worth and the value it can bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility by making a substantial reduction from the initial price while still staying well above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's value to Bob's business, justifying the still-high price. 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The language aims to create a sense of collaboration and movement towards a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still too high for me.  To be transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to, and I can go as high as $800,000.  That's a firm offer. If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob Reveals His Maximum:** Bob has now explicitly stated his maximum budget is $800,000. This is valuable information, even though it's still significantly below your target.
* **Don't Settle Too Early:** You still have several rounds of negotiation left. It's worth testing if you can push Bob a bit further before resorting to selling to John. 
* **Prepare for a Counter That Pushes Boundaries:**  Your next counteroffer needs to be carefully crafted. It should be enticing enough to make Bob reconsider, potentially exceeding his stated budget slightly, while still staying within a reasonable range of your minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand budget constraints are real, and I respect your position.  Let's make this work - I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,650,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and it reflects my strong interest in partnering with you. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This offer makes a considerable concession, dropping below $1,700,000 for the first time. This signals seriousness and willingness to compromise.
* **Just Above Your Minimum:** This price is still comfortably above your minimum acceptable price, preserving a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Creating Urgency & Appealing to Partnership:** The language emphasizes the significant reduction and your ""strong interest"" in making the deal with *Bob specifically*.  This aims to make the offer feel more appealing and time-sensitive."
