"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,150,000. I am willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is already a very competitive price for what this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
