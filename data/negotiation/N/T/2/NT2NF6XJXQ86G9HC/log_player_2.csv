"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than John's, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. The goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for Alice to come down a bit more.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm stuck at $10,750.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap there."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I want to make this work. How about we split the difference at $10,875?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $10,875 is well within Bob's budget of $12,000 and is a significant savings compared to John's price.
* **Negotiation:** Alice has already come down significantly from her initial price, and ""final offer"" suggests further negotiation might be unproductive. 
* **Risk:**  While a slightly lower price could be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting and then demanding a higher price or walking away entirely is too high.

Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds."
