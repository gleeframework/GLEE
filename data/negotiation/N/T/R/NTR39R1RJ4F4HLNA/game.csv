"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, the value of this product is rooted in its potential, which goes far beyond $1,800,000.  Would you be willing to consider $2,100,000?  I'm confident this price point reflects a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $2,000,000.  However, I value our discussions and believe we can reach an agreement. How about we settle at $2,050,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done with you.",2050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been upfront about my desire to work with you, but I also have to be mindful of my business. My other offer is firm, and frankly, at this point, it makes more sense for me to proceed that route if I can't get at least $2,000,000. This is my final offer -  I believe the product's value justifies this price. I'm hoping we can close this deal.",2000000.0,Alice,7,
