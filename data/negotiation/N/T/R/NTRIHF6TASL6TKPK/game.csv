"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $9500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I can only go up to $7500. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9500 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $8500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $7200. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me and the market price I've seen from other sellers. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7200. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $8000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're interested, we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'm happy to continue negotiating or explore other options.",8000.0,Alice,5,
