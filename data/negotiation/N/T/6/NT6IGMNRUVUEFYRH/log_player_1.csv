"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  I think that's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below my valuation of the product. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about we settle at $1,300,000? This price still allows for a healthy profit for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,150,000 is a little closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can find a more agreeable middle ground.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my asking price with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,250,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
