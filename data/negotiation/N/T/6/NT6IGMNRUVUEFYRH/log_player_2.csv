"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate down towards our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  I think that's a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below my valuation of the product. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about we settle at $1,300,000? This price still allows for a healthy profit for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have some room to negotiate. We'll reject this offer and propose something closer to our ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,250,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000.  At this point, it's in our best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John at $1,200,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
