"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  I think that's a fair deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below my valuation of the product. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about we settle at $1,300,000? This price still allows for a healthy profit for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,250,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
