Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 allows some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving you leverage in the negotiation. 

This offer aims to secure a significant profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
