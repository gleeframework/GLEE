Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my ideal selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price point and will encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I can sell to John for the same price, so there's no reason to continue the negotiation."
