Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 13,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's still a decent offer. Since I don't want to leave money on the table, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still reasonable. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 12,500}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
