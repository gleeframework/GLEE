"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly overpriced. There's a good chance we can negotiate a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's asking price. A starting offer of $70 gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $120 limit.
* **Polite and Interested:**  We don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away.  We keep the tone positive and express genuine interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate.  While $85 is a decent price, we want to see if we can get it even lower before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $77?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $77, we're signaling willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Seeking Agreement:**  Phrasing like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise"" encourages Alice to see this as a mutually beneficial deal."
