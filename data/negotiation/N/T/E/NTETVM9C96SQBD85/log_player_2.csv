{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, there's room to bargain.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This is a good starting point to see if she's willing to lower her price."

Alice is coming down, but there's still room to bargain.  We'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to our goal of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice we're serious about buying but still looking for a better price.  It's a small increase from our previous offer, but hopefully, it's enough to entice Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice has met our counteroffer, so it's time to accept. We've managed to save a considerable amount compared to buying from John, and we're still within our budget."
