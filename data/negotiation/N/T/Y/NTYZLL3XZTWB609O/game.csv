"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you could be even greater.  I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This price is still fair to me and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap between our valuations is still pretty significant. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,275,000. This reflects my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a fair price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that you're serious about this product.  While $1,275,000 is still below what I need,  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I can offer $1,325,000 to try and close the gap.  Let me know if that works for you.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  To make this deal happen, I'm going to come down a little more.  My final offer is $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account the value of this product for both of us.  Let's seal this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
