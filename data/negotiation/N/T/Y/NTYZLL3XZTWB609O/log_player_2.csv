This seems like the best time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a reasonable price, saving you $150,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Momentum:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, suggesting she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks her withdrawing the offer or reaching an impasse, pushing you towards John's less appealing offer."
