"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it, which is still a fair price given the potential return on investment. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer is a considerable investment, the value of this product is truly unique and  $1,800,000 is a much more accurate reflection of its potential. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes both its worth and your interest."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,650,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's potential while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

At this point, Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap sufficiently. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum and avoids further time spent in negotiations."
