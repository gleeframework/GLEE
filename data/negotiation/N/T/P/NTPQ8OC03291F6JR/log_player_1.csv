"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Leaving Room:**  By not starting at the absolute maximum ($1,500,000), I signal some flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Confident Tone:** My message conveys the product's value and my optimism for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant profit, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm willing to engage in further rounds of negotiation to bridge the gap and aim for a more favorable outcome. Bob's message indicates he sees the value in the product, giving me confidence we can find a price point that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  Given the unique value this product holds, I'm proposing $1,350,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've come down $150,000 from my initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate. I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's unique benefits to justify the higher price.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** My message aims for a collaborative tone, emphasizing a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,350,000 is more appealing than your initial offer, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price feels more comfortable for me, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a strong price that yields a significant profit. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling negotiations. Accepting now ensures a favorable outcome and avoids the uncertainty of further bargaining."
