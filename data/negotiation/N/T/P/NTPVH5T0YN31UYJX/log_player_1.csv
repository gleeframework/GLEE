Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $125 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:**  You've stated the product is worth at least $100 to you, so $125 is a decent starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, there's space for a compromise.
* **It's clear and concise:**  You're stating your price and expressing interest in a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $125 is a bit too high for me.  How about $110?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
