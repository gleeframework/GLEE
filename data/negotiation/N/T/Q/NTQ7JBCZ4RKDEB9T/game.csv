"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This reflects a significant discount from your initial price and is the maximum I'm willing to offer at this stage.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to move significantly from my initial asking price,  how about we meet halfway at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and represents a fair price for both of us.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, but this is my final offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
