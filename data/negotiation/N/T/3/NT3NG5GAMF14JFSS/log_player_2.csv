"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its features and your potential return, I'm offering it at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the potential of this product. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price while still being within Bob's budget.  $9,500 is a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for further compromise if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While $10,250 is a better price than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He has room to negotiate further and can potentially secure a price closer to his target of $9,500.  Rejecting the offer allows for another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10,250 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  How about we settle on $9,800?  That seems like a fair price considering the value we're both seeing in this product."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a smaller step than before, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  $9,800 is a midpoint between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer, leaving room for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're very close. Let's make this happen. How about $10,000 even and we close the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $10,000. While it's still above Bob's initial target of $9,500, it's significantly lower than the initial price of $11,000 and closer to Bob's desired price point. Accepting this offer will save Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially beneficial option.  Furthermore, further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
