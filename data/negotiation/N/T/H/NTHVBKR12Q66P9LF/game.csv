"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. How about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $11,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $11,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. How about we meet at $12,250? I think that's the best I can do, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product.",12250.0,Alice,5,
