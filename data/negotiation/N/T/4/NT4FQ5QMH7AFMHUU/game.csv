"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  My counteroffer is $1,050,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
