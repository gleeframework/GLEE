"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay my full value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price.  I still have time and I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway.  He's offered $9500 and my minimum is $12000, so $11000 seems like a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not yet in a situation where selling to John for $12,000 is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to drop my price again, but only a little bit. This is getting close to my minimum, but I still think I can get a slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I'm running out of rounds, I still think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. Selling to John for $12,000 is still an option, but I'm hoping to get a slightly higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm going to offer Bob a price that's a bit more tempting than my previous offer, but still within a range that feels fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I'm down to the last few rounds, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.  However, I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John.  I'm hoping I can get just a little bit closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to drop to $10,000, which is just below my minimum.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll have to sell to John."
