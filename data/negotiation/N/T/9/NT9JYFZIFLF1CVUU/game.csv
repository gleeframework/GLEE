"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am able to afford. How about we consider $500000 for the product?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1200000? This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $1000000? This is my final offer before considering other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
