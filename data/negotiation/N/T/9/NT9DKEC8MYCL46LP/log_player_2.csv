Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and potential impact, I propose a price of $10,000 for it. This is a special offer considering its high worth to you.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $10,000 is above your maximum budget of $12,000, and you want to save as much money as possible.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds to work with, giving you time to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John is an option:**  Knowing you have an alternative at $12,000 gives you leverage in negotiations."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while taking into account your valuation of the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high:**  $9,500 is still above your ideal price point.  You're aiming for the $9,000 range to maximize savings.
* **More room for negotiation:** You still have several rounds left, and you can likely get closer to your target price.
* **John remains an option:** You're not in a rush to buy from Alice, as John provides an alternative at a higher price."
