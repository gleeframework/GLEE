"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $975,000, so I'll offer $937,500. Can we agree on this price?",937500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $937,500 is still below what I need to get for this product.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $956,250. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision.",956250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $956,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $940,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Can we agree on this price?",940000.0,Bob,6,
