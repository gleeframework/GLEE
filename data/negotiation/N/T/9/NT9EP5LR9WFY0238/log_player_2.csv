"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $12,000, but Alice is asking for $11,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and her offer is $10,500. 
* **Meeting in the middle is a fair compromise.** While you initially offered $10,000, Alice is now offering $10,500, which is a reasonable midpoint.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  His price of $12,000 is higher than Alice's current offer. 

Accepting Alice's offer gets you the product at a good price, saving you money compared to buying from John."
