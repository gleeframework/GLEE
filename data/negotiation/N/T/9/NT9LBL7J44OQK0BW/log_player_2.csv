"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if we can get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows us to initiate a counteroffer and see if we can get closer to our goal of saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for the product. How about we discuss around that number? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to our target, but it's still higher than we'd like to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and we can try to push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows us to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I'm still not quite there. Let's see if we can get a bit closer to my target. How about we aim for $1,120,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is very close to our last counteroffer of $1,100,000. While we could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will walk away or become less flexible.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price. We've saved a significant amount compared to buying from John, and we've reached a mutually agreeable price."
