# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its high value to you at $120, I propose we make this transaction even more enticing. How about we agree on a price of $100? This still represents a significant saving for you compared to the market value, while ensuring a fair return for us. Looking forward to your positive response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($100 < $120).**

Even though the product is worth $80 to Alice, you still get a better deal than buying from John."
