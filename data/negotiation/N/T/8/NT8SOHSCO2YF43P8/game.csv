"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $17,500. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm willing to consider purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,000? This still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, so how about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $14,000 is still a little low for me. To continue the negotiation, I'm willing to go down to $15,500.  This is a fair compromise that still allows me to get a good price for my product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,6,
