"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's good to start with an offer significantly higher than your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price. The friendly tone aims to build rapport and encourage Bob's engagement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would you consider lowering the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $150 is tempting, it's still below your minimum. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive, and you can try to meet somewhere in the middle. There's still a chance to get a better price from Bob than John's guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go quite that low. How about we meet in the middle at $175?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counter-offer acknowledges Bob's offer while still pushing for a higher price. 
* **Strategic compromise:** By suggesting $175, you're showing flexibility but also holding firm above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining communication:** The message aims to keep the negotiation going by suggesting a solution that could benefit both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $160. This is more than John is offering and above your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to push for a bit more in the next round, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and you risk him walking away. Taking the $160 now secures a profit and avoids potentially losing the sale altogether."
