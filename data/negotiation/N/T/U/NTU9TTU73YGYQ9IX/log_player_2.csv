"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  I'll see if I can push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm still willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for me. It's lower than my initial counteroffer and significantly cheaper than buying from John. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become firm on her price, or I could end up paying even more from John. Accepting this offer is the most sensible decision to secure the product at a good price."
