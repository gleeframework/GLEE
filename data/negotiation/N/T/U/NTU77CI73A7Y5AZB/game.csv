"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to sell the product without losing too much.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",9500.0,Bob,4,
