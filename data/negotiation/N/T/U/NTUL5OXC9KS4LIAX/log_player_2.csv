"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Alice's offer** means you pay $14,000. This is better than buying from John for $15,000. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer** forces you to buy from John, costing you more. 
* **Buying from John** is the worst option, as it is the most expensive. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to minimize your cost while still obtaining the product."
