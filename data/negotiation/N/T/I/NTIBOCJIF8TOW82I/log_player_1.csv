{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth more to Bob. I'll be ready to negotiate down if needed, but I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. I'm also leaving room for counteroffers and potential compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Can you meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to see if I can get a better price. I believe the product is worth more than $850,000, and I'm confident I can secure a higher offer from Bob."
