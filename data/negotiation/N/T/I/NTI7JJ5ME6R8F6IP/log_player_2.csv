"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you, and I believe it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better deal than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. He's offering $10,500, which is still a good profit for Alice (she values the product at $10,000) and a decent savings for Bob compared to his alternative option of $15,000. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product while still trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still better than John's price of $15,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, or Bob might end up paying even more if he gets into a bidding war. Accepting this offer saves Bob money and secures the product."
