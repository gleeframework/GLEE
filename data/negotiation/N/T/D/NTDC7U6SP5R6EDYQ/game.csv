"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $110,  which is still a fair price for this great product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $95.  I'm serious about buying, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $102.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product.  What do you say?",102.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $102.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now.",100.0,Bob,6,
