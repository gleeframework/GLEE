"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer because it's below my minimum threshold of $100. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $110,  which is still a fair price for this great product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $95.  I'm serious about buying, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below $100. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $102.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $102.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum threshold. Accepting it is the best outcome in this scenario as I get my minimum desired price and close the deal without further negotiation."
