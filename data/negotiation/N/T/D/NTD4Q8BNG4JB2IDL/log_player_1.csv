Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay slightly less. This maximizes my potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially getting me closer to my $150 goal."
