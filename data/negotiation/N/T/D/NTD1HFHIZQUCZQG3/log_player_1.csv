Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, aim for a price significantly higher than $800,000, but below Bob's $1,500,000 valuation. 
* **The Offer:** $1,300,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for you ($500,000 above your minimum) while still offering Bob a good deal (saving him $200,000).

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of acceptance from Bob."
