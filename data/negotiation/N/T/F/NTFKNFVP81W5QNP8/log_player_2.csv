"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1,750,000. This represents a significant value for you, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I understand this is a substantial investment, but I believe the potential benefits of owning [Product Name] far outweigh the cost. Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I have a guaranteed sale with another buyer for $1,500,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.
