"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I acknowledge your perspective on the value,  $900000 is a bit too low for me to accept at this time.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
