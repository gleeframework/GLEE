# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $135.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $130? That would be a good compromise for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is closer to your ideal price, you can still try to negotiate further. You are willing to pay $125, so you have room to offer a slightly higher price, but still try to get it below $130."
