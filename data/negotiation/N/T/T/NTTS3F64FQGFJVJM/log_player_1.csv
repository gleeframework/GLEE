Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  However, I'm not going too high, as I don't want to scare Bob off immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and will come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm offering $8,200, a compromise between my last offer and Bob's latest counteroffer. This demonstrates I'm serious about selling to Bob, but also that I'm not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally met my minimum acceptable price! It's time to accept his offer and close the deal. This way I get the product sold and earn $8,200, exceeding the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
