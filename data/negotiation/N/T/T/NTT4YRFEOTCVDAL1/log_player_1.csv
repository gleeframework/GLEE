Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $145 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $135. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $135 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $138. If that doesn't work, I might have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $138
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While getting a higher price would be ideal, Bob is signaling that this is his final offer. Accepting the $138 ensures a good profit above the $120 John is offering.  It's not worth risking losing the sale at this point."
