"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to consider your offer. In light of our discussion, I would like to counter with a price of $1100000 for the product. This is my best offer given the value it holds for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1050000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it gives you a respectable price and gives me a chance to acquire a valuable product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
