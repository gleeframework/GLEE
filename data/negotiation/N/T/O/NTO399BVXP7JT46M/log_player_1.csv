{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows for potential negotiation and gives me a starting point to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to show you I'm serious about selling to you.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still a bit above $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired earnings.  I'll try to nudge Bob closer to my price point with a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're coming up on your price. I'm willing to go down to $11,500, but that's as low as I can go.  This is still a fantastic price for a product that's worth $12,000 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is the price I was initially willing to pay when you first offered the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $11,000, which is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,500.  While I would prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the sale and potentially have to sell to John at a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures I make a decent profit."
