This offer is much higher than both your budget and what you can get from John.  A counteroffer is necessary to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering the product! Unfortunately, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price. While it might seem aggressive, it provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better price. However, I'm still a bit above the value you're willing to pay. I can meet you halfway at $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down considerably, but the price is still above what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

This counteroffer brings us closer to my budget while still offering Alice a price significantly higher than John's.  It signals my willingness to negotiate further but also my firmness on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $75. I can do $85, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice seems firm at $85, which is above my budget and what John is offering. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
