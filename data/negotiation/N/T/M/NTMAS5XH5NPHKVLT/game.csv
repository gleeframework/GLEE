"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",10000.0,Bob,4,
