Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a bit more than $910,000 to make this worth my while. My next counteroffer is $920,000.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to your budget, you've already had 6 rounds of negotiation and still haven't reached a deal.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting another counteroffer from Alice that is above your budget is too high.  It's better to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring you stay within your budget and get the product you need."
