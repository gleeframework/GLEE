Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a great opportunity to own it."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a significant discount from my asking price while still being substantially higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Urgency:**  The message implies a ""deal"" and encourages Bob to act quickly to secure the product.

This strategy aims to balance the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of a higher sale price."
