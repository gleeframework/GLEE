"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $105 was still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $102. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",102.0,Alice,5,
