Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed $150 from John. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, even if it's just to $145. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While I could start higher, asking for something too close to $150 might discourage Bob immediately. This offer aims to seem reasonable while still being profitable."
