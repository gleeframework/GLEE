"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $72.50?",72.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $72.50 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $80? That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to close this deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
