"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price above my minimum.  It's a good balance between maximizing profit and keeping Bob engaged in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject it and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $72.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $72.5 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit.  I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $72.50 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $80? That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
