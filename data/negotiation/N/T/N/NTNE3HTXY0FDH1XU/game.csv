"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out first. However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is already a competitive price.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $10,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. While $10,000 is still less than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is my final offer, as it's the same price John is offering.",12000.0,Alice,5,
