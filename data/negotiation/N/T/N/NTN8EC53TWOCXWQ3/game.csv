"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",155.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $155 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but I think that's as low as I can go. The product is still worth more to me than that, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",145.0,Alice,5,
