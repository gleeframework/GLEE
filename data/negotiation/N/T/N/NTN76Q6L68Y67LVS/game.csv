"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering both our valuations. Let me know if you're willing to work with that.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
