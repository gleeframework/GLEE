"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save $100,000 by negotiating with Alice.  While Alice's offer is attractive, it's still $100,000 above her own valuation.  There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering both our valuations. Let me know if you're willing to work with that."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's counteroffer and still $25,000 less than what Bob is willing to pay John.  It's a good deal for Bob, and further negotiation might be time-consuming and potentially lead to a higher price if Alice becomes less willing to negotiate."
