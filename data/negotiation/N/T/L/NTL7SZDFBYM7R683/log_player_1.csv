Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
