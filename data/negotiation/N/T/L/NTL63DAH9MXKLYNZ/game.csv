"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay a premium for the quality, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me at $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. However, due to the high demand and the cost involved in producing such a premium item, we cannot accept $70. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $80, which is closer to our original asking price. This still allows us to cover our costs while providing you with a great deal. Please let me know if this works for you.",80.0,Alice,3,
