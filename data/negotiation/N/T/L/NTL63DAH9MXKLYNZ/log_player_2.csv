Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. However, due to the high demand and the cost involved in producing such a premium item, we cannot accept $70. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $80, which is closer to our original asking price. This still allows us to cover our costs while providing you with a great deal. Please let me know if this works for you.
