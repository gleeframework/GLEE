"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,200,000 is certainly a decent offer, it falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000,  reflecting the value of the product and the potential benefits for both of us. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial price.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
