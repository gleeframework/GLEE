Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($1,150,000) makes it a tempting deal. It's a significant saving for him while still earning you a profit above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another interested party creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
