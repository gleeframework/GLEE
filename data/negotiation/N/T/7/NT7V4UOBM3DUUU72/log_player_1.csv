{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth in the market. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but we also want to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it at or below this price would be selling ourselves short.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing John will buy the product for our minimum acceptable price gives us bargaining power.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** By starting at $1,100,000, we:
    * Leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
    * Present a price that is significantly higher than Bob's valuation but still potentially appealing given the ""exclusive opportunity"" framing.

This offer balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for maximizing our profit."
