"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer.  You can get the product for less from Alice, and even if you can't, you can always get it from John for $150. So, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept the offer.  Alice has met you halfway at $130, which is a good deal considering you are willing to pay up to $150.  You'll save $20 by accepting Alice's offer."
