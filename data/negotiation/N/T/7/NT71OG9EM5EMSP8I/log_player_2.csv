"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I believe it offers significant value, but I want you to have the first opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can get the product from John for $120, which is less than Alice's offer.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
