Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I believe it offers significant value, but I want you to have the first opportunity."",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $135 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's also a price that might seem like a ""deal"" to Bob compared to a potential higher retail price he might imagine.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning this is a special offer for him and that you have other buyers, you subtly encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Focus on Value, not Just Price:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, hoping to sway Bob to focus on the perceived benefits rather than just the price tag.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
