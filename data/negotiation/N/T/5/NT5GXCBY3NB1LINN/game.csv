"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a lower offer of $8000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to be more flexible, but I still need to make a decent profit. I can do $9800. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $8500. I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $9200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, though. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me in the middle, but $9200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm at my limit, and I'm starting to think that buying from John might be the better option. I'll make a final offer of $8000, and if you can meet me at that price, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're at your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up just yet. I can do $9000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $8000. I've made a final offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it. If not, I'll have to buy the product from John for $8000.",8000.0,Bob,10,
