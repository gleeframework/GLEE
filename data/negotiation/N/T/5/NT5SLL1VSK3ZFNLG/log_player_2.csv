"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $13,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```
At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000. Since I can get the product for $12,000 from John, it makes more sense to cut my losses in the negotiation with Alice and go with the guaranteed lower price.
