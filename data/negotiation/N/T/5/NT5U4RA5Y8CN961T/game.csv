"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit high for me right now. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $8500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate the offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $8500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
