"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $8,750?  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,750 is close, but I need to get at least $8,900 for it.  I'm confident you won't find this kind of value anywhere else.",8900.0,Alice,5,
