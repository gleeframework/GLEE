"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000,  which reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,450,000 as a final concession.  This offers you a great deal, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
