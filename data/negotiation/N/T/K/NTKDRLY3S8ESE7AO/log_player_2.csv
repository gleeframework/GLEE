"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item that's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate, even if it's just to gauge Alice's flexibility.  You have no information about the product's true value, so you should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in this product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $13000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the quality of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

While $13,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your initial counteroffer.  Keep negotiating to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm thinking of a price of $12800. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the quality of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
