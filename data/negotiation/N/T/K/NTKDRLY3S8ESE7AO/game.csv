"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item that's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in this product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider $10000?  I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $13000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the quality of the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $13000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11500? I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concern, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm thinking of a price of $12800. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the quality of the product. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12800 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $12000. This would be a fair price, allowing you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget. ",12000.0,Bob,6,
