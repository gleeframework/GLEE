Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't settle for anything below my minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing my bottom line. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrasing implies I'm open to discussing the price, encouraging Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a professional and enticing tone for Bob."
