Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already invested a significant amount in the product, and I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and my original price. Would you consider $9,500?

It's clear that Alice is trying to increase the price after we reached a fair point. It's unlikely she'll go down to $8,000 and we're running out of rounds. It's better to cut our losses and buy from John for $12,000 than to risk getting a worse deal with Alice."
