{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget price of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the tone for negotiation and shows Alice I'm serious about a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my maximum budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $11,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $11,000, showing Alice I'm serious about making a deal.  This is a good middle ground, and I'm hoping Alice will see the value in a quick sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's worth it. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $11,500, it's still above my ideal budget. I'm going to try to negotiate further. I think there's still room for us to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still slightly more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle on $11,250? This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's closer to my budget and shows Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway.  At this point, the negotiation is getting tight, so I need to find a price that's both attractive to Alice and within my range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,500 was a bit too high, but I can do $11,000 was too low, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between the two, which is $11,250 was your last offer, so I'll go to $11,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $11,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's very close to Alice's last offer, but still within my budget. I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, hoping to encourage Alice to accept.  If she doesn't, I'll likely go with John's offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,500. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is my minimum price. I'm willing to make a final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my budget.  We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems she's not willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  Since I only have one more round left, it's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $10,000.  This ensures I get the product at a price that works for me, and it avoids further haggling."
