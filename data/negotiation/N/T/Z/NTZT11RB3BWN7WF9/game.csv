"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $11,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's worth it. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still slightly more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle on $11,250? This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,500 was a bit too high, but I can do $11,000 was too low, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between the two, which is $11,250 was your last offer, so I'll go to $11,750. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $11,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,500. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is my minimum price. I'm willing to make a final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,9,
