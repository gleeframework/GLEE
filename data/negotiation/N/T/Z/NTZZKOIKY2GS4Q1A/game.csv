"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering a price of $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you've placed on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,
