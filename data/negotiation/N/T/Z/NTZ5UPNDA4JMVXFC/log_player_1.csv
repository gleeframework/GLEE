I'll reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is still a bit too low, but I see we're getting closer. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We've gone back and forth a few times, and while Bob seems open to negotiation, he's still not reaching my minimum price point.  I'm running out of rounds, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal for me."
