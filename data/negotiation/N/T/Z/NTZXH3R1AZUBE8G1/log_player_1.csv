Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Don't undervalue:** I know the product's worth at least $150 to me, so I won't go below that.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** While I want to maximize profit, starting too high might scare Bob off. Offering a price of $125 leaves room for him to counter-offer while still securing a profit above my minimum. 
* **Highlight value:**  By calling it a ""special price,"" I create a sense of urgency and value, making it more enticing for Bob to accept.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob before resorting to selling to John."
