"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to make an offer of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits you, as you'll be getting a great deal, and it's closer to my original asking price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above what I can comfortably spend. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $975,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my end and a fair price considering the value to me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a generous offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell the product to you.
