Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we could offer the product at $1,200,000 to Bob, there's a chance he'll find it too expensive. By offering it slightly below our guaranteed price with John, we increase the likelihood of Bob accepting and us securing a higher profit than $800,000.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning that we have another buyer lined up, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed sale to John."
