Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit, knowing she has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John.

**The Challenge:**  Bob represents potential profit above the guaranteed amount, but only if Alice's asking price is attractive enough.

**The Solution:** Offer a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to encourage a quick sale.

Here's Alice's offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  I believe it will be highly valuable to your operations. I'm willing to make a deal at $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Why this offer makes sense:**

* **Profitable:** Alice ensures a profit of $100,000 above John's offer.
* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is higher than Bob's perceived value, but not exorbitantly so. It creates a sense of potential gain for Bob if he believes he can leverage it for even more.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" and mention of ""other interested parties"" add a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
