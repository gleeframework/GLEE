"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's still room for negotiation.  You can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counter-offer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $9,250, which is a good price for you. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and then potentially asking for a higher price.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's still significantly below what it's worth to you."
