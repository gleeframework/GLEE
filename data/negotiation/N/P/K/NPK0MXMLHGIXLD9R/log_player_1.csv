Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation.
* **Fairness:**  $100 is a fair starting point, giving Bob a discount while still allowing me to earn significantly more than my minimum.
* **Flexibility:**  This offer sets the stage for negotiation if Bob rejects it. I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer (John) at $80, so I won't be pressured to accept any offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and while it's tempting to accept it, I can still potentially do better.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired $100, or at least closer to my minimum acceptable.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if the negotiation with Bob fails, I have John as a backup buyer at the same price. This gives me the flexibility to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, considering your interest in the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $90 is a good compromise, closer to my desired price while still offering Bob a discount.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob and keep the negotiation open. 
* **Keeping Options Open:**  I'm still mindful of my backup offer from John at $80, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise, meeting me halfway between my previous offer of $90 and his last offer of $85.
* **Maximize Profit:**  While it's not my ideal price, $85 is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and still allows me to make a decent profit.
* **Time Considerations:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher offer, but there's a risk of Bob backing out or the negotiation dragging on.  Accepting now ensures a quick and profitable sale.
* **Backup Plan:**  Even though I have John as a backup buyer at $80, accepting Bob's offer allows me to earn an extra $5 without the risk of losing both deals."
