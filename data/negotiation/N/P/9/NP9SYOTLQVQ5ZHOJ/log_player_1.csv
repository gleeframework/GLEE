I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good deal. However, I'm also willing to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a better price than $85. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility but still hoping to get closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $87 is close enough to my minimum acceptable value of $80.  It's also a better price than I could get from John.  I'll accept his offer."
