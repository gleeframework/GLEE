Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm looking to get $10,000 for it. It's a fantastic deal for something of this value."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By stating you believe it's worth a ""significant amount,"" you aim to plant the seed in Bob's mind that the product's value might be higher than he initially thought.
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
