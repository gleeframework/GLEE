Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be even more valuable.
* **Justification:**  A brief explanation like ""before I list it publicly"" provides a reason for Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts, great! If he negotiates, you still have the safety net of John's offer."
