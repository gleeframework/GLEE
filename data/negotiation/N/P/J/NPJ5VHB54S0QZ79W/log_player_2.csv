"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can initiate a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price. He has a strong bargaining position as he knows he can buy the product for $1,000,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for this product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showcasing Bob's intent to negotiate aggressively. 
* **Justified offer:** Bob provides a reason for his offer, suggesting it reflects the value he sees in the product. This keeps the negotiation focused on the product's worth.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message concludes with a positive tone, indicating a willingness to continue discussions and reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and still reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $800,000 is a significant improvement from her initial $900,000 price and is much closer to Bob's counteroffer of $700,000.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous option at this point. While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher cost."
