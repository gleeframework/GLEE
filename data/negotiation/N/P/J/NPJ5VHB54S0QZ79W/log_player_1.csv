Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700000 for this product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
