Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price is still fair considering the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $850,000 is closer to my budget, I still want to try and negotiate for a lower price. I can potentially get it for cheaper from Alice, or just buy from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're holding firm at $750,000, but I'm still a little higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $825,000 is still over my budget, but Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price of $800,000. If she rejects again, I'll buy from John."
