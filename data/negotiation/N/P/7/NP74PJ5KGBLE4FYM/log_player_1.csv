"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the value to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. This allows for some room for negotiation and indicates my belief in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price is still fair considering the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still stubbornly sticking to $750,000. I'm not yet ready to settle for that amount, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $800,000. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're holding firm at $750,000, but I'm still a little higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. $825,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is the same as what John is willing to pay. Since I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob, I'll accept his offer."
