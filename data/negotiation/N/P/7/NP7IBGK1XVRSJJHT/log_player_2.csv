{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a good margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to cover my costs. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 simply isn't enough for me. Given the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.

Alice's offer is still above my budget. I've already gone higher than I planned to, and with only 3 rounds left, it's likely she won't budge further.  I'm going to take the safe option and buy from John."
