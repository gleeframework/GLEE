"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly highlighting the product's value without going into specifics. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is a test. If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, we can start negotiating down. It's important to be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't get us to a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's counteroffer is far off, it shows he's still interested. This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **Avoiding a bad deal:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to my initial asking price, but I'll be willing to negotiate further. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer ($17,000) and Bob's offer ($8,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm still highlighting the value of the product without being overly aggressive.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing my offer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a step towards a potential agreement. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not going to give the product away for less than what it's worth to me. I'm prepared to go through a few more rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's closer to my desired price than his initial offer, it's not yet a profitable deal for me. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  Bob's counteroffer suggests he's still willing to negotiate.  This means there's likely room for a higher offer from him in the next round.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can still sell to John for a higher price if this negotiation doesn't work out. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him to come closer to my desired price point. I'm aware that we are getting close to the midpoint and I'm still willing to compromise. But, I won't accept an offer that doesn't meet my minimum profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $11,000. It's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm again offering a midpoint price, this time between my previous offer ($12,500) and Bob's latest offer ($9,500).  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate without completely sacrificing my bottom line.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a ""significant compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  I want to avoid getting stuck in a cycle of small, back-and-forth offers.  This counteroffer represents a considerable move from my previous position, potentially pushing Bob closer to accepting.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a calculated risk. I'm pushing towards an agreement, but if Bob rejects again, I'll need to reconsider my strategy. I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option, but I'm hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute most I can justify spending. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Selling for $10,000 would result in a loss for me.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Bob has stated his absolute maximum, leaving little room for further negotiation. 
* **John's offer remains:** I still have the option to sell to John for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little higher. I'm running out of rounds and need to be cautious, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirements. I'll carefully consider my counteroffer in the next round to maximize my potential earnings while recognizing the risk of losing the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant compromise.  This is a final offer from me, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and push Bob towards acceptance.
* **Significant Compromise:**  I'm still highlighting the compromise I'm making, even though it's a smaller step than previous rounds. This helps maintain a sense of fairness in the negotiation.
* **Threat of Alternative:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options, creating a potential pressure point.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a calculated gamble. I'm pushing for a price that is closer to my desired price but still leaves a small margin for profit. It's a risk, as rejecting it could lead to a deal falling through. However, with only a few rounds remaining, I need to take a more assertive approach to see if we can reach an agreement."
