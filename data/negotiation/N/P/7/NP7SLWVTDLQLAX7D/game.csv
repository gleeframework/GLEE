,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $11,000. It's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for this product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute most I can justify spending. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant compromise.  This is a final offer from me, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
