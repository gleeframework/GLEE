"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $7250? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price, and I'm eager to get this product to you.",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $7250. I'm thinking more along the lines of $6800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $6800 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. Let's meet in the middle at $7000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",7000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced $7000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $6800, but I need to be honest, I'm getting close to considering buying from John for $8000. Can you meet me at $6900?",6900.0,Bob,6,
