Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth significantly exceeds that for you.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,200,000) increases the potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A slightly lower price than $1,200,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate upwards. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning you have another buyer, you incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your initial offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob before having to resort to selling to John."
