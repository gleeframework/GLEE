,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000, but I'm not budging further.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1050000 is a more reasonable price for this product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $980000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, and I'll meet you at $1020000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $990000. I think we've had a good negotiation, but I'm not willing to give up much more value. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's now or never, Bob.",1050000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'm going to make one last attempt to negotiate. I'll offer $995000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John.",995000.0,Bob,10,
