"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can do better than $11,500, as he's willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice values the product at $10,000. There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. He can likely get the price down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a decent profit. How about we go with $11250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's already offered $10,750 and she countered at $11,250, so there's still room for negotiation.  He's better off trying to get the price down further before considering buying from John."
