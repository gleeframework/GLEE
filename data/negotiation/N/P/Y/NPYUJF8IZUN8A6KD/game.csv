"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10750?  This would give you a good profit, and it's a price I'm confident I can work with.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11250 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer $11000. This is a good price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
