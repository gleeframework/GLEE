It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's room for a deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective,  $1150000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1250000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is within your budget and is a good deal considering you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and the risk of Alice becoming less willing to compromise."
