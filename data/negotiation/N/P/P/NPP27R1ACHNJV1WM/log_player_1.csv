"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come up to my desired price range. 

**Important Note:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 at any time.  This is a safety net, but I'll try to maximize my earnings by negotiating with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for that price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired range."

{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer but shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still ensuring I get a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for that price yet.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, as I still believe there's a chance to reach a mutually acceptable price.  However, I am keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle for $1,400,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not desperate enough to sell at a price below what I consider the product to be worth.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better deal.  However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."

{""product_price"": 1525000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $1,525,000.  This is a smaller concession than before, but I'm still trying to find a price that Bob will accept while still ensuring that I get a price that's close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that we are getting closer to a deal and be willing to meet me in the middle."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price,  I'm starting to run out of time and negotiation rounds. It's becoming increasingly likely that Bob will not come up to my price.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for me to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I meet my minimum price target."
