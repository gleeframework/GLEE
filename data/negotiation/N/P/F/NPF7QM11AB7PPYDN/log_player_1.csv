prompt,response
Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high, but be reasonable:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $100, I want to maximize my profit. Starting at $120 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes a ""great deal"" and that the product is ""perfect"" for Bob, aiming to increase its perceived value. 
* **Direct question:** Ending with ""What do you say?"" encourages a prompt response from Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to balance the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit margin."
