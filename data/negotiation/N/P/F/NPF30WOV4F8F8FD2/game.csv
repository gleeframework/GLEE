"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,750? That feels like a fair deal to me.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going up to $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $11,250 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great value for the product, and I think it's worth considering.",11250.0,Alice,5,
