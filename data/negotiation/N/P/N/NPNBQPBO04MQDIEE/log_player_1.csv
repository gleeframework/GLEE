Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this presents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $800,000, giving you a baseline.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to go lower or stick closer to your guaranteed price from John.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the product's ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential return on investment"" to justify the high price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired minimum, allowing you to be firm in negotiations with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and negotiation tactics."
