"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This would still be a good deal for you, as you value it at $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
