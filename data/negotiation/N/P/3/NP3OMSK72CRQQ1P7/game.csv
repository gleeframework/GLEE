"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, I'm not comfortable with $12,000.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This is my best offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you have other options, $8,500 is far below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise.  It's a great price for a product of this quality.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering I can get the same product elsewhere for $8,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
