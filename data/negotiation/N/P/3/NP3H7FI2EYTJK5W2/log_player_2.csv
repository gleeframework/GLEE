"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking to get a good price for it. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You're better off going with John who's offering the product within your price limit."
