Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a higher offer of $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as beneficial for Bob."
