"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential benefits for you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that cost.  Would you consider a much lower price of $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider $15,000? I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value over time.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little, but $15,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working to find a price we can both agree on. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? That's a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly. How about $11,500?  That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,6,
