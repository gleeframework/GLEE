"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential benefits for you."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that cost.  Would you consider a much lower price of $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and accepting it would be a substantial loss. While his counter is a starting point, I believe there's room for negotiation. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider $15,000? I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value over time."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little, but $15,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  This is a tough choice, but I think there's still room to negotiate a bit higher.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working to find a price we can both agree on. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? That's a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly. How about $11,500?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
