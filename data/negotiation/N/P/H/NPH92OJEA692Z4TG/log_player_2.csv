"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is close to my limit, but there's still room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counteroffer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and interested:** Keeps the negotiation friendly and shows I'm serious about buying.
* **Ambitious but not unreasonable:** $110 is a significant drop but still profitable for Alice. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  I'm aiming low, expecting Alice to counter, but signaling I'm willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However,  $130 is still too close to my maximum. I'll counteroffer to see if there's any more flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  I've moved significantly from my initial offer, demonstrating I'm serious about finding a deal.
* **Lands on a fair price:**  $120 is the exact value the product holds for Alice, meaning she wouldn't be losing money.
* **Direct and clear:** By ""splitting the difference,"" I'm proposing a simple solution that's easy for Alice to accept. 

While there's a chance Alice might counter again, this offer puts us in a strong position to either secure a great deal or comfortably walk away knowing we tried."
