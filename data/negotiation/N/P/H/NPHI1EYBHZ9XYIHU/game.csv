"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? This would give us both a fair deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,800? I think that would be a fair compromise.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $6,800 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $7,200. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, $7,200 is very fair. To be completely transparent, I did find someone else selling at a slightly lower price.  However, I prefer to work with you and find an agreement we're both happy with. Would you be willing to settle at $7,000 even? That would seal the deal for me.",7000.0,Bob,6,
