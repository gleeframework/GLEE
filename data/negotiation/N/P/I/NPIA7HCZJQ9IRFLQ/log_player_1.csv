{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, leaving room for potential compromise. It also highlights the value to Bob, potentially increasing his desire to acquire the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price, considering your value for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 isn't quite meeting my needs.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still firm on a price of $950,000. This price reflects the product's value and offers a good opportunity for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to make a reasonable deal.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal of $1,000,000,  Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and it allows me to achieve a good profit.  I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
