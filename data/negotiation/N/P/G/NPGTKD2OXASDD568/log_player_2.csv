"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider $16,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal from Alice or buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,500 is still a little out of my price range. I'm confident that $15,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is tempting, he can still potentially get a better deal from Alice in the remaining rounds.  John is also offering the product for $15,000, which is a solid backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $15,500 for the product, but I won't go any higher. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $16,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $15,000.  

Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, but there are only 3 rounds left.  The risk of not being able to reach a deal with Alice is high.  John is a reliable option and offers the product at the exact price Bob is comfortable with.  It's a better choice than gambling with Alice and potentially ending up with a higher price or no product at all."
