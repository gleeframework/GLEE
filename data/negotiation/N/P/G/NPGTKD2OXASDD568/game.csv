"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider $16,500 for the product. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,500 is still a little out of my price range. I'm confident that $15,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",15000.0,Bob,4,
