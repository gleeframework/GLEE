"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This gives Bob a little room to negotiate, but also ensures I'm making a profit over my minimum. It's important to start strong and see what Bob's reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,600,000 is a good deal, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,700,000. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum price and a fair amount for both of us. I'm going to accept his offer to avoid further rounds and close the deal."
