"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose specifics at this stage, I assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm confident that it could be even more valuable to you, depending on your needs and vision.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a significant discount from what I believe it's truly worth. If you're interested, let's discuss further. If not, I have another buyer lined up for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  While she claims it's worth more to her, that information doesn't change the fact that the offer is not financially viable for you.  You can get the same product from John for a much lower price."
