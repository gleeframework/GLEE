Bob should reject the offer.  It's still higher than his target price. He can still get the product for $12,000 from John."

Bob is trying to inch closer to his target price without going over it.  A price of $11,000 is still a good deal for Alice, as it's closer to her desired price of $12,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  He should keep negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price."

Bob is now offering a price that's only $500 over his maximum budget. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to save a bit.  It's a good strategy as it shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but not willing to overpay significantly."
