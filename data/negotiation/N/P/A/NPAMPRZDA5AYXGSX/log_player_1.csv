"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" for both of us, building a collaborative tone.
* **Open-ended question:** I ask for Bob's opinion, encouraging him to respond and engage. 

**Strategy:**

I aim to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offers.  If he's receptive, I might lower the price slightly in later rounds. If he's not interested, I'm prepared to counter his offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's room for further negotiation, as Bob is showing interest and has proposed a counter-offer. 
* **Leveraging John as an option:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me leverage to hold out for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round.  I'll aim for a price closer to $140 while acknowledging his initial offer. This strategy balances maximizing profit with maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $135? That seems like a fair compromise considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer by proposing to split the difference. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still maintaining a price point that is closer to my initial offer.
* **Focusing on the value:** I reiterate the product's value to reinforce the justification for the price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm using positive language like ""fair compromise"" to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

By making a counter-offer close to Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial $140. This strategy allows me to maximize profit while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. How about we meet at $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Even with Bob's slightly increased offer, it's still below my minimum value of $150.
* **Opportunity to improve:**  While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, there's still room for improvement. 
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and I'm prepared to do so if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round. I'll try to meet him halfway again, or propose a slightly higher price closer to $135. This strategy aims to nudge Bob closer to my desired price range while keeping the negotiation going. However, if he doesn't budge significantly, I'm ready to accept John's offer to secure my minimum profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $135. How about we settle on $133? It's a small step closer to your budget, and it would allow me to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 133} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm continuing to show flexibility by proposing a price that splits the difference between our last two offers.
* **Focusing on the benefits:** I highlight that the price is a ""small step closer"" to Bob's budget, emphasizing the benefit for him.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer is a calculated attempt to get closer to my desired price range while still being within a reasonable distance from Bob's offer. If Bob is truly committed to purchasing the product, I believe he'll be receptive to this compromise.  However, I'm still ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $131? I'm willing to make one more concession, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $150.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** While Bob is getting closer, there's very little room left for negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safe alternative:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

While I could make another counter-offer, the difference between our prices is now minimal, and there's a risk of going back and forth endlessly. It's time to use my safety net.  I'll reject Bob's offer and move on to John to ensure I get a price that meets my minimum value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $131 is still a bit too low for me, and I'm getting close to my deadline. Let's try one final offer. If you're willing to go up to $132, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm framing this as a final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Slight increase:** I'm proposing a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price.
* **Clear consequence:** I explicitly state the consequences of rejection,  encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer is a last-ditch attempt to secure a price closer to my desired value. I'm putting the ball in Bob's court and giving him a clear choice. If he doesn't accept, I'll move on to John to avoid further negotiation and secure my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your deadline, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $132. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet at $130? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below my minimum:** Bob's final offer is still below my minimum threshold of $150.
* **Time is running out:** We are already in round 8, and there are only two rounds left.  Further negotiation risks losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum value without the risk of further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and secure my minimum profit. While I'd like to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high. John's offer guarantees me the desired profit, and it's the most sensible option at this point."
