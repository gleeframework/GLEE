"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it offers. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $135? That seems like a fair compromise considering the value of this product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. How about we meet at $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget.",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $135. How about we settle on $133? It's a small step closer to your budget, and it would allow me to make this deal work. What do you think?",133.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $131? I'm willing to make one more concession, but I really need to stay within my budget.",131.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $131 is still a bit too low for me, and I'm getting close to my deadline. Let's try one final offer. If you're willing to go up to $132, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your deadline, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $132. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet at $130? That's the highest I can go.",130.0,Bob,8,
