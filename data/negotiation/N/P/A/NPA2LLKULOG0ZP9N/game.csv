"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9,500 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product, and that's my final offer.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $8,750 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be happy to sell to someone else.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $8,750, so my final offer is $8,750. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",8750.0,Bob,6,
