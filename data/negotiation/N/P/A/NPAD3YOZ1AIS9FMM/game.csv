"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
