Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $140 is a good starting point. It's close to Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate, but still leaves room for me to make some profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  By leaving room to negotiate, I avoid immediately shutting Bob down and give him a reason to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.
* **The John Factor:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can confidently walk away and still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he's shown interest. 
* **Controlling the Negotiation:**  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I maintain control of the negotiation and have the chance to push for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer.  $120 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm open to making a deal. How about we split the difference and go with $130?  That way we both walk away happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $130 is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and maintains a positive tone, making Bob feel like the negotiation is fair and mutually beneficial.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, allowing me to get closer to the maximum possible value while keeping the deal attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'd prefer to earn more, it's a decent profit.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Further negotiation might risk Bob walking away entirely or potentially lowering his offer even further.  
* **Time Value:**  Continuously negotiating takes time and effort.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities.

**It's important to weigh the potential for a slightly higher price against the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Given the proximity to my minimum price and the potential for negotiation fatigue, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical decision.**"
