(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,350,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive but not unreasonable. A $100,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant step, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. While it's closer to Bob's counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob another opportunity to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he is willing to compromise. However, he's still offering a price below Alice's current offer and above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, and there's a risk that continuing to negotiate will lead to a stalemate.  At this point, buying from John for $1,500,000 is the best option for Bob. While it's not the lowest price, it guarantees Bob gets the product without further risk or delay."
