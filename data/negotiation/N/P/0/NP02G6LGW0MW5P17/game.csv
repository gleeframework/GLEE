"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still allows you a good profit margin.  Let's work together and make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This still gives you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I'm unable to go above $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to move forward with the transaction.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my minimum price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to increase my offer to $995,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.",995000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'm offering the product for $1,010,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a good profit margin and is just slightly above my minimum price.  I'm open to further discussion if needed, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round.",1010000.0,Alice,7,
