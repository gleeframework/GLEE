Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to you. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,800. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,800 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."
