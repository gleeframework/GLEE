"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget and even above her own valuation of the product.  It's important to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's important to start with a substantial counter to give yourself room to negotiate.
* **Anchoring:** By proposing a much lower price, you're attempting to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired range. This can influence Alice's perception of what's possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The counteroffer leaves plenty of space for negotiation. You can gradually increase your offer if needed, while still aiming to stay well below your $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $12,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to give you a discount from my original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $12,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than both your budget and John's alternative price. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is willing to negotiate, which is a good sign. You can likely bring the price down further.
* **Don't Reveal Your Hand:** Accepting this offer might make Alice think you're willing to go even higher. It's better to continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To be honest, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do something closer to $7,000?"", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer is still below your maximum budget but significantly closer to Alice's latest offer, signaling that you're serious about the purchase if the price is right.
* **Strategic Position:** By proposing $7,000, you're aiming for a price that's beneficial for you while still potentially appealing to Alice (as it's a significant profit margin above her valuation).
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  You still have John's $8,000 offer as a fallback, which gives you some negotiating power.  You haven't shown Alice that you're desperate to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $9,500? This is still a good price for the product, considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to give you a discount from my original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer, But Not There Yet:** Alice is definitely coming down, but $9,500 is still above both your target price and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her message suggests she's still open to negotiation, using phrases like ""willing to make another compromise.""
* **Leverage:** You still hold the advantage of knowing John will sell at a lower price.

Now is the time to push for a final concession from Alice, getting as close to $8,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal, but I need to be at $8,000 even.  That's the absolute best I can do. If you're agreeable, I'm ready to finalize everything right now."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer firmly establishes your maximum price.  It conveys that you're serious but won't budge further.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying you're ""ready to finalize everything right now,"" you create a slight sense of urgency, which might encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Win-Win Framing:** While $8,000 is your maximum, it's still a $7,000 profit for Alice. Highlighting that this is a fair price for both of you could be persuasive.

**Outcome:**

This strategy puts the ball in Alice's court. She'll need to decide if making the sale at $8,000 (and a still-good profit) is preferable to potentially losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to meet at $8,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $10,000? This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has become less flexible and is unwilling to meet your best price. Her latest offer is a step backward.
* **No More Room to Negotiate:** You've reached your absolute limit, and pushing further is unlikely to change Alice's mind.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $8,000. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product at the price you know is available."
