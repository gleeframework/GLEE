"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're almost there. $12,500 is getting close, but I need to get at least $12,800 for this to make sense.  This product is truly top-of-the-line, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand the product is top-of-the-line, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $12,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $12,200, which would be $12,350. Can we meet at this price?",12350.0,Bob,6,
