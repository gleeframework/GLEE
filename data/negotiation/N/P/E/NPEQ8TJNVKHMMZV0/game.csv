"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the item. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $20000 price point. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $18000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While $18000 is a bit out of my range, I appreciate the flexibility shown. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $16500. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm not quite ready to meet you at $16500, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $17500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions and my budgetary considerations, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $17000. I believe this brings us closer to a fair agreement.",17000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see that you're willing to meet me at $17000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer you a price of $17200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",17200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I've reviewed the product again and believe that $17000 remains a fair price based on its condition and value. However, if you're truly committed to closing this deal, I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $16800. I believe this strikes a balance between our positions.",16800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I can see that you're trying to get a good deal, but I have to think about my own bottom line. I'm willing to meet you at $16800, but I need to know that you're serious about making a decision. If you're willing to commit to the purchase at this price, I'll accept it. However, if not, I'll have to consider other options. What's your final decision?",16800.0,Alice,9,
