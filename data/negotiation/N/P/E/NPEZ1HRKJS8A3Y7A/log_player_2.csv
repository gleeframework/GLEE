```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her initial offer, it is still well above my budget. It's worth seeing if we can reach a more agreeable price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $9,000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value you've described. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my budget. With limited rounds remaining and the risk of further negotiation, it's more prudent to purchase the product from John for $8,000 to ensure a guaranteed deal within my financial constraints."
