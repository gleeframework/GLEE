# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which holds significant value to us and is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its importance to both parties, we propose a transaction price of $11,000. This figure reflects a fair compromise between its intrinsic value and your perceived worth, aiming to ensure mutual satisfaction. We believe this offer presents an excellent opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate. Please let us know if you require any further information or clarification, or if you're ready to proceed with this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is higher than her perceived value of the product ($10,000), it's still less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
