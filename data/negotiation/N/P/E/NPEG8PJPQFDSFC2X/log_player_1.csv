Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some room to negotiate while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'm curious to see Bob's response and gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $150 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I'd like to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up a bit on his offer, and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is too low. I'm not willing to go any lower than $150, so I'll take John's offer and sell the product to him.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still above my minimum and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
