It's always best to try and negotiate a better price, especially since Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget.  We'll see if we can get a better deal."

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will likely make Alice feel the need to compromise."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
