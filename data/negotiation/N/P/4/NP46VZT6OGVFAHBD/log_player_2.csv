"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is certainly intriguing, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price point. This move shows he's serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price doesn't meet his expectations. This counteroffer is bold, but it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than John's offer. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming to get the price closer to his desired range. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to pay $975,000 for this product, reflecting the value I see in it while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making smaller adjustments to his counteroffer. This shows he's serious about a deal but also isn't willing to go much higher than his initial counteroffer. The message also emphasizes the value Bob sees in the product, making it clear that he's not just trying to lowball Alice.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while keeping Bob in a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price. While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential for a deal at this point is uncertain.  It's better for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for the guaranteed price. This secures the product for his maximum budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that might not lead to a favorable outcome."
