"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1450000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to secure a good price while leaving room for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,400,000. This is a slight concession from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price point that's closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a little lower than my initial price, it's close to my desired value and avoids further negotiation rounds. There's a risk that we could go back and forth with counteroffers and end up at a lower price, or even lose the deal.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a relatively good price and closes the deal."
