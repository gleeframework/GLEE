# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $9500. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000, which is the price I was initially willing to sell it to John. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.

However, I'm not willing to send another counteroffer, as I think I've already made a reasonable offer at $9,500. I'd rather buy the product from John for $8,000, which is a better deal for me.
