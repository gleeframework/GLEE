"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. I believe it would greatly enhance your operations and efficiency.

"Alice, your product seems great, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $10,500. Considering the unique features and benefits of our product, I would like to propose a revised price of $11,500. This still represents a significant discount compared to the product's true value to you, while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $11,000. This would be a good deal for both of us. ",11000.0,Bob,4,
