"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $80.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, based on our previous discussion, I would like to propose an adjusted price of $90 for the product. This still offers a slight premium over the $80 value you placed on it, while being closer to my initial offer.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $87.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest one, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",87.5,Bob,4,
