"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $175.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $162.50. What do you think?",162.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $162.50 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $125.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $157.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $157.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $141.25?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",141.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than $152.50. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $157.50 and $141.25. How about we try $149.75?",149.75,Alice,7,
