"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I'm offering for sale. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try to negotiate, even if the initial offer is at your maximum price point. There's a chance Alice is willing to come down a bit, and we'll see what counteroffer we can make in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a starting point for negotiation. Offering $80 represents a 20% discount from Alice's asking price, which is a reasonable starting point. It shows that we are serious about buying the product but are also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer Bob.  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing flexibility, but we can still try to negotiate further. We can offer a price slightly higher than our previous offer to show good faith, but still try to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about $85? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our offer slightly, demonstrating willingness to meet halfway. $85 is a good middle ground between our previous offer and Alice's counteroffer.  This shows we are serious about closing the deal while still trying to save money."
