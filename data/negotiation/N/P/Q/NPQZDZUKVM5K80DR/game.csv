"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing the price, of course, but I'm confident you'll recognize its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is quite high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's potential and is a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the adjustment, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I need to see this working within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, the gap between our valuations is still too large. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. Let me know if this works for you, otherwise we might need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
