Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing its value to him. This helps him feel more comfortable considering the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price further. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations could drag on, and I might ultimately end up with the same price. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a decent profit quickly.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at $9,000 seems like the most rational choice, balancing the desire for a higher profit with the need for a timely sale."
