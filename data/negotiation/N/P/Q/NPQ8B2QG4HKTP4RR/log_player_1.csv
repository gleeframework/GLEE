"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at ($80).  I want to see if I can get him to agree to a price closer to what I value it at ($100). I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get more. I'll try to negotiate further with him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $90 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product. How about $95? It's still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it's worth the extra few dollars."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
I'm trying to find a middle ground between our two offers. I'm hoping he'll accept this counteroffer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I am willing to pay $92 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm willing to drop my price to $94, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 94} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I am willing to pay $93 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would love to get closer to my desired $100, with only four rounds left and John's offer at $100, it's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob.  Accepting his offer of $93 secures a sale and is very close to my minimum price."
