"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget. While I value your interest, $950000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which reflects the unique value of this product. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
