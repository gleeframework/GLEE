"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above Bob's budget of $10,000. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. It's still a great deal, considering its value to me, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's comfortable spending limit of $10,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $16,000 is still a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $14,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds for me. I think it's still a great deal, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although $14,500 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his $10,000 limit.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further. There's still room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering $13,250. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both agree on it."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $13,250. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,750. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 is still higher than Bob's budget of $10,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, Bob has already made several counteroffers and it's clear Alice is not willing to go much lower. It's time to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees Bob gets the product at a price he can afford without risking further negotiation rounds that might not yield a better result."
