"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and your interest, I propose a price of $14,000 for it. This offer is tailored to provide you with a great deal while ensuring a fair return for us. Please let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. He can use the fact that he knows John is willing to sell for $12,000 as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12500}
