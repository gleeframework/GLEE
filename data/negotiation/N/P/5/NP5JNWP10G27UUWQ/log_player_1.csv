Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think it would be perfect for you, and this is a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob only values the product at $80, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept a still profitable price.
* **Justification:** Offering a ""special price"" or highlighting it as a ""great deal"" might make the offer more appealing, even if it's higher than Bob's valuation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** It's important to remember you have a guaranteed buyer at $150. This means you don't have to settle for anything less than that. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate or walk away knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
