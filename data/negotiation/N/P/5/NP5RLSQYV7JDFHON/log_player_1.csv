{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offering Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and framing the price as fair to encourage his acceptance. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profits:** I'm aiming for a high starting price, hoping to secure a deal close to Bob's perceived value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The initial price is not my final offer, leaving room for counteroffers and ultimately finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Prevent Losing to John:** While I'm negotiating with Bob, the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, but it's significantly lower than my initial offer.  

I'm rejecting Bob's offer for the following reasons:

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. He's shown a willingness to negotiate, indicating he values the product. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting his counteroffer, I maintain the upper hand in the negotiation and can potentially push for a more favorable price in the next round.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profits:**  I'm not settling for a price that's too low, especially since Bob has shown interest in the product.
* **Maintain Control:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to dictate the next steps in the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Protect Against Selling to John:** While selling to John is an option, I'm still aiming for a better price and will only accept a deal with Bob if it's truly advantageous."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit below my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product for you, and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a compromise that moves closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** My message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob and highlights the fairness of the proposed price. This approach is designed to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profits:** While my counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value and reflects the value the product holds for Bob.
* **Create a Middle Ground:** This counteroffer establishes a middle ground between our previous offers, making it more likely that Bob will accept and conclude the negotiation.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Although I've lowered my price, I'm still not giving away too much. This allows me to continue negotiating if Bob rejects my counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, and it's a significant improvement over his previous offer.  Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Value for Time:**  While I could potentially continue negotiating, doing so risks further delays and the chance of Bob walking away entirely.  
* **Fair Price:**  $1,250,000 is a decent price considering the value the product holds for Bob, and it's still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject this offer and counter with a higher price, Bob might walk away, leaving me with the option of only selling to John for a lower price. 

This strategy prioritizes:

* **Securing a Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and eliminates the risk of Bob backing out completely.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could potentially get a higher price, the risk of losing the deal and being forced to sell to John for a lower price is too high.
* **Gaining Immediate Profit:** Accepting the offer brings in a substantial profit that's more secure than continuing to negotiate."
