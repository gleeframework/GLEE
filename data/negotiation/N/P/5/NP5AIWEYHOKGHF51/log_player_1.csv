Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's 20% higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit.  I'm confident that Bob will at least consider this offer since it's still less than he'd be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $900,000,  it's still significantly less than what I know the product is worth to him and what I could potentially get.  I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring a profit for myself. I believe this price is fair and might be acceptable to Bob, considering he's already expressed a willingness to pay $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $950,000 is a good deal considering:

* **It's significantly higher than John's offer:** Selling to Bob ensures I get a better profit.
* **Further negotiation might be lengthy and uncertain:** There's a risk that Bob might become less interested or that we might not reach an agreement at all.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
