"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $150 is already a very competitive price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming to keep my spending under $100. Could we possibly settle on $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored at $100 and unwilling to budge.  Since we have a guaranteed offer for $100 from John, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob. We maximize our profit by taking the guaranteed $100."
