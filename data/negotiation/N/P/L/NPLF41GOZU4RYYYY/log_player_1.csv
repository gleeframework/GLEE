"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and a good deal for Bob.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to make a deal.
* **Openness:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to respond and begin the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting it now would mean leaving $2,000 on the table. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds remaining, giving me ample opportunity to explore better options and potentially secure a price closer to my ideal.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** Selling to John for $8,000 would be a loss compared to Bob's offer, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to enjoy significant value from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Reaffirming value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll receive even at this price,  further motivating him to accept.
* **Creating urgency:** The message includes a direct question, encouraging Bob to respond quickly and avoid losing out on a good deal."
