{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, so this is a fair price, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a higher price, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This makes it attractive to Bob while still giving you a good profit.
* **It shows flexibility:**  The message emphasizes your willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I am willing to pay $10,800 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than what you were hoping for. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200.  This price still allows me a reasonable profit, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to pay $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your desired price, and accepting it means you can close the deal without risking losing the sale to John."
