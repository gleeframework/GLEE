"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic in negotiations to start with a strong offer that favors you. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is significantly lower than Bob's valuation, giving him an incentive to negotiate but leaving me space to come down if needed.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, reinforcing its importance to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly closer to his perceived value, it's still a substantial amount above my minimum acceptable price. I have room to negotiate further and try to secure a better deal. Selling to John would be a significant loss compared to what I could potentially get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value.  However, the value this product brings to the table is unique and significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Hold Firm:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by coming down in price. However, the decrease is moderate, indicating that I still value the product highly.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the unique value proposition reinforces why my price is justified.
* **Middle Ground:**  The $1,200,000 offer aims to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my previous price, potentially making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, showing he's motivated to buy. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly higher price, especially with several rounds remaining.  I'm not yet in a position where selling to John for a guaranteed $800,000 is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we settle at $1,125,000? This reflects my bottom line while acknowledging your budget considerations."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** By decreasing the offer by $75,000 (compared to the previous $100,000 drop), I'm signaling that I'm reaching my lower limit. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message uses language like ""bottom line"" and ""fair price"" to convey firmness without being overly aggressive.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:**  This offer aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both parties, potentially avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000 again? I think that's the sweet spot for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob has repeated his previous offer, indicating he might be firm on this price. Further negotiation could be risky.
* **Strong Profit:** $1,050,000 is still a significant profit margin over my minimum acceptable price and a good deal overall.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiations might not yield a much better result and introduces uncertainty. Accepting now secures a good outcome."
