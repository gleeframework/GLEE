"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum budget is $800,000, I'm offering the lowest price I'm willing to pay. This is also the price John is selling for, so Alice has a clear alternative if she rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it's closer than before, I don't want to risk further negotiation as I might end up paying more than I want.  I can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is within my budget and a better deal than Alice's current offer."
