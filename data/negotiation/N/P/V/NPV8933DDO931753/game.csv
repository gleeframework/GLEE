"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
