"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm open to discussing a price that benefits us both. How about we start at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product is quite valuable, and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of benefit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,750. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",9750.0,Bob,4,
