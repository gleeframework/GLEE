Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
