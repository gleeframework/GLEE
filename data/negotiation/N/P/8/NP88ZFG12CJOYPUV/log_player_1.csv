"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I propose a starting price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and our belief that it's a good deal for Bob, encouraging him to engage seriously. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"":** This phrasing subtly implies scarcity and desirability, potentially making Bob more eager to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both our minimum and his perceived value. While his interest is a good sign, accepting such a low offer at this stage would leave a lot of money on the table. We need to signal that we're serious about a higher price. We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reject:** We acknowledge Bob's offer to show we're engaged in the negotiation but clearly state it's unacceptable.
* **Reiterate Value:**  We reinforce the product's value to justify our position and avoid seeming solely focused on a high price.
* **Significant Concession (But Not Too Much):** We reduce our price by $50,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong final price.  We don't want to concede too much too quickly, as this could signal desperation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  We are better off rejecting and countering, aiming to close the gap and reach a more favorable agreement in the remaining rounds. We'll send a counteroffer closer to our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, finding a compromise that works for both of us is key.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budgetary considerations."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Common Ground:** We acknowledge Bob's point about compromise to build rapport and show flexibility. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We make another significant price reduction ($50,000), moving closer to our minimum but not crossing it. This keeps the negotiation active and puts pressure on Bob to counter with a more serious offer. 
* **Justifying the Price:** We subtly reinforce the product's value even while lowering the price, aiming to prevent Bob from anchoring too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Let's settle this - how about $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally reached our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While we could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting now ensures we close the deal at our minimum acceptable profit."
