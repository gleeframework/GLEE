"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your ideal price point. There is room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1075000.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, considering the value you'll gain from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than buying from John for $1,500,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject further offers and he'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
