"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  I'm offering a price that is still significantly below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate but still leaving a substantial margin for me. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I create space for negotiation. This also demonstrates my confidence in the value of my product.  I'm hoping to leverage Bob's strong interest to secure a favorable deal for myself while keeping the possibility of selling to John as a fallback option."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm aware that Bob is interested, so I believe I can use this negotiation to secure a better deal.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation.  I will counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices.  This approach helps me maximize my earnings while keeping the ""SellToJhon"" option open if negotiations become unfavorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving room for further negotiation.  My counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining my goal of securing a good price.

**Strategy:**

By raising the price slightly, I demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise, but I also show that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my initial offer.  This tactic encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,080,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to secure a higher price.  I believe Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay more, so I'm going to continue the negotiation to see if I can secure a better deal.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make another counteroffer.  I'll aim for a price slightly higher than his latest offer, hoping to find a compromise point where we can both agree. The ""SellToJhon"" option remains a safety net if the negotiations become unfavorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1120000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a price that is more favorable for me.  I believe that Bob is willing to pay a little more to secure the product, as he has shown his willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

By lowering the price slightly, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise. However, I'm still holding out for a better price than Bob's last offer. This strategy aims to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point. I'm also keeping the ""SellToJhon"" option open as a safety net if the negotiation becomes unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would ideally like a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Given that we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm running the risk of losing the deal altogether, accepting this offer seems like the most logical choice. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good deal and avoid the risk of having to sell to John at a much lower price. While I may not be getting my ideal price, $1,060,000 is still a significant profit and a better outcome than selling to John."
