,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $1,250,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  Would you be willing to meet halfway at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
