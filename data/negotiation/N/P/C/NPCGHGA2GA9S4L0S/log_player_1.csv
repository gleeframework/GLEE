"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and is potentially attractive to Bob.  I'm aiming to get as much value as possible while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's still a potential to reach a better price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from the previous round to $900,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable counteroffer and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still lower than my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and we're already halfway through the rounds. I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might lead to further price drops or a stalemate, potentially leading me to have to sell to John for a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a reasonable price, though not ideal, and allows me to close the deal."
