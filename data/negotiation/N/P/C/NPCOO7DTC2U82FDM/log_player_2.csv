"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an introductory price of $150. This exceptional deal won't last long, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. While it might be tempting to try and negotiate, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price.  John is offering the same product for the same price, so it's a safe bet to go with him."
