"Alice, your product is very interesting, but $1,150,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows us both to walk away with a successful deal.  Let's find common ground and make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget.  It's a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 still falls short of what this product is truly worth.  I'm ready to meet you halfway at $1,087,500. This price point is fair and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer! $1,087,500 is very tempting, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000. This demonstrates my commitment to a mutually beneficial agreement, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. Let's shake hands and move forward.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
