"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $11,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  I'll reject her offer and counter with a much lower price to gauge her flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the conversation at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's opening price. It gives us a lot of room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $12,000 maximum.  Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice met us halfway, we still have room to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on and allows us to inch closer to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me partway, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,750? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference again, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate, but also holding firm on getting a good deal.  This offer is still significantly below our maximum and gives us some wiggle room if Alice counter-offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to make a profit. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's the best I can do. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I believe there's still room for her to come down a little further.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going.  Let's see if I can get her closer to $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're right, I am serious about the product, Alice. Let's make this happen - how about $8,600?  That's a fair offer and gets us both what we need."",
""product_price"": 8600
}
``` 

This counter-offer is getting close to my ideal price point while still allowing for some minor concessions if needed.  It's a strong offer that shows Alice I'm serious about closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to squeeze the price down, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is already a great deal for you, and I think it's the best I can do. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding firm, and this price is very reasonable compared to John's offer. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk her walking away from the negotiation at this point."
