"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than Bob's absolute maximum. This provides room for negotiation while showing Bob's serious interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 represents a fair price for its value, I understand that's a significant investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth continuing negotiations to try and get closer to Bob's target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $9,500, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's offer while still remaining within Bob's budget. It also emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the proposed price, which could be persuasive to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. This product is truly worth the investment, and to show my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob is better off trying to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant compromise for me. It would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise further, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. Bob is close to his maximum budget, but a $1,000 gap between his offer and Alice's offer could be bridged with a few more rounds."
