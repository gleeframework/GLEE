"Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 represents a fair price for its value, I understand that's a significant investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $9,500, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. This product is truly worth the investment, and to show my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant compromise for me. It would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works.",10000.0,Bob,6,
