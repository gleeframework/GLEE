Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price without explicitly revealing why it's so valuable to me.
* **Leaving John as a Backup:** While I have John as a guaranteed buyer, my goal is to maximize profit. I'll explore negotiations with Bob before settling for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his counteroffer was expected, accepting $850,000 would be a substantial loss. I'll proceed to the next round and propose a counteroffer, aiming to close the gap and find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product represents is considerably higher than your current offer reflects. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,525,000."",
""product_price"": 1525000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** I don't explicitly reject Bob's offer to keep the negotiation open and avoid appearing overly aggressive. Instead, I express appreciation for his engagement.
* **Strategic Counter:** I'm making a significant move towards Bob's offer by dropping almost $700,000. However, I'm still aiming for a price well above both his valuation and my minimum. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** By framing the counteroffer as ""meeting halfway,"" I'm appealing to a sense of fairness and compromise, potentially encouraging Bob to make a more substantial move next.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  This offer ensures I still make a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price, even if it's less than my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,525,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  His incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to reach a price point that works for me. I'm better off taking John's guaranteed offer to avoid wasting time on further negotiation that's unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome."
