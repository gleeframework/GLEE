{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's fair considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows for some flexibility and keeps the possibility of a mutually beneficial agreement open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer it for $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm aiming to meet Bob halfway with this counteroffer. It's still above his initial offer but demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will lead to a final agreement closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go above $850,000.  Accepting his offer is the best option at this point.  It's above my minimum of $800,000, and further negotiation might not result in a better deal."
