Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $14,000. I believe it will be a valuable asset to you, and this offer is a great opportunity to acquire it."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum price ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer and still land within a range that's profitable for us.
* **Highlight Value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the price and encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If we believe Bob is a tough negotiator, we might start slightly higher (e.g., $14,500) to allow for more concessions.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Knowing if Bob needs the product urgently or if we have time for back-and-forth can influence our strategy."
