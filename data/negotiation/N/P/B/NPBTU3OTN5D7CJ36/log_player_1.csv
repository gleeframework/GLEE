Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's maximum value as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $11,500, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to try and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  I'm not yet willing to sell to John because I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm countering with $12,500.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's worth it to avoid further negotiation.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
