Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Your minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000.** This is what you would get from John if Bob rejects your offer.
* **You want to maximize your profit.** Therefore, you want to offer a price higher than your minimum, but not so high that Bob is likely to reject it.
* **You don't know Bob's valuation.** This means there's a risk he might reject any price above your minimum.

**Offering $1,500,000 is a compromise:**

* It's a significant profit for you compared to the minimum.
* It leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.
* It's not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. 

By offering this price, you balance the risk of rejection with the potential for a higher profit."
