"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10200. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Alice,5,
