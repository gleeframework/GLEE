"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be valuable to me, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I would be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, but still reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
