{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is asking for $9,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer.  You're offering a significant discount, but still leaving room for negotiation."

You're still not quite at your target price. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still $100 away from your target price, but Alice is getting closer. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7900}
``` 

You're making a small increase in your counteroffer to show Alice you're willing to compromise. It's a last attempt before considering John's offer."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached the point where Alice is only willing to come down $50 from her original asking price. While this is closer to your target, it's still not a good deal.  It's time to take John's offer and get the product for your target price."
