""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?"",

}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $16,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""product_price"": 14000
}
```

I'm aiming to bring the price closer to my budget while acknowledging her willingness to negotiate. This offer is a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. How about $15,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but I'm only $500 away from John's price. I'll push a bit further, but I'm prepared to walk away and go with John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been great to work with, and I think we're very close. Would you consider $14,500?  That's a fair compromise and would allow me to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

I'm sticking to my position and offering a small increase to signal I'm serious about buying but need her to move a bit more. I'm hinting that if she doesn't accept this, I might go with John."
