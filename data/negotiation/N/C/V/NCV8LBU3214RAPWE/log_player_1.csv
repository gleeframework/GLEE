Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, either from Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $16,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. "", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $16,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm also concerned that if I accept his offer, he may try to negotiate down further in future rounds.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if I don't get a satisfactory offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. How about $15,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been great to work with, and I think we're very close. Would you consider $14,500?  That's a fair compromise and would allow me to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get a better offer from him.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob or having the negotiations drag on further."
