"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still not ideal.**  You can potentially get a better price by counter-offering.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice values the product at $8,000, and you're willing to pay up to $10,000. This means there's a potential for both of you to find a price that works."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  A $9,000 offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial $9,500 price, showing your intent to negotiate. 
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  This offer is still above Alice's value of $8,000, giving her incentive to consider it.
* **Keeps John's Offer in Mind:**  While you want to save as much as possible, you're still aware that John is offering the product for $10,000, so you're not willing to go too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now very close to your desired price.**  You're only paying $200 more than your ideal price point.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.**  You risk Alice getting frustrated and sticking to her $9,200 price, or you might end up buying from John for $10,000.
* **Accepting now minimizes risk and gets you the product quickly.**  At this point, the potential savings from further bargaining are small compared to the time and uncertainty involved."
