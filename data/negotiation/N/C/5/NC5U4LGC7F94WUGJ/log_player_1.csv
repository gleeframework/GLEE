Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong Alternative:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $10,000, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob.

This offer balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, I make a significant profit. If he rejects it, I can still sell to John and meet my minimum acceptable price."
