"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it for the same price, there's no benefit to negotiating. You can buy it from John immediately for the same price."
