"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm more interested in a price point around $600,000. I believe this represents a fair offer, considering the market value and my specific needs. Let me know if this price range works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're narrowing the gap, but we're not quite there yet.  I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to move to $750,000.  I feel this is a competitive offer and a reasonable compromise considering the value it holds for me.",750000.0,Bob,6,
