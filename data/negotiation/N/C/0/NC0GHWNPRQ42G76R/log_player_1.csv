"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly and inviting message sets the stage for a positive interaction. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's value emphasizes its worth and justifies the price.

I'm eager to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $8500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000.**
* **I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob.**  
* **Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, but I'm willing to risk a bit more to try and get a better deal with Bob.**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. It's still a great price for the product's value, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm dropping the price slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth to justify my price point.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages further discussion and avoids creating tension.

I'm hoping this counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price and leads us to a successful deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000.**
* **I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob.**  
* **Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, but I'm willing to risk a bit more to try and get a better deal with Bob.**

I'm not yet ready to give up on negotiating with Bob. I will counteroffer him again, aiming to reach a price that is closer to my minimum and also acceptable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm highlighting the reduction in price to emphasize the compromise I'm making.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm posing a question to Bob, inviting further discussion and potentially a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing to Bob and lead to a deal. I still have several rounds remaining, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
