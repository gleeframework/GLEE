"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need something closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  How about $950,000? This reflects the true value of the product, and it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? ",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. But $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - $912,500. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle on $890,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. Let's settle on $900,000. That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",900000.0,Alice,7,
