Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need something closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  How about $950,000? This reflects the true value of the product, and it's a fair compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. But $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - $912,500. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. Let's settle on $900,000. That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's consistently holding her ground around the $900,000 mark.  At this point, the risk of her going higher outweighs the potential savings of pushing for a lower price. Accepting her offer of $900,000 secures the product for you at a significant discount from her initial asking price."
