"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. $10,000 is still more than what the product is worth to Bob, and he has room to negotiate down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's a better offer than the first one, he can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  $9,750 is still a bit too high for Bob, and he has room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already negotiated the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer, and he's only a few hundred dollars away from his desired price.  If he rejects this offer and continues negotiating, he risks Alice walking away from the deal or the negotiation going on too long and losing time.  At this point, it's better for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product."
