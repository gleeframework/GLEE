"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's still a great deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
