"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's initial interest and see how willing he is to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still a substantial profit for me.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push him higher.  There are still rounds left, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This is a firm offer, and I'm hoping Bob realizes the value of the product and agrees to it. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John at this price and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. I've already gone down significantly from my initial offer, and there are only four rounds left. I'm going to sell to John and guarantee myself a $1,000,000 profit.  It's not ideal to be walking away from a potential higher offer, but time is running out, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
