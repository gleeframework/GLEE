Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring Alice gets a great deal.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $12,000 might scare Bob off, leading him to reject the offer. This offer balances profit with the risk of losing the sale to John."
