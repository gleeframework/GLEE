Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates a sense of urgency (""limited time"") and makes it seem like a small concession on your part. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price.

While Bob might try to negotiate, this starting point gives you room to potentially make a small concession (e.g., $115) and still secure a profit."
