"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm happy to start the conversation at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired maximum of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  This will give Alice a sense of Bob's seriousness while still leaving room for them to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get an even better price. There are still plenty of rounds left, so Bob can continue to press for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still hoping we can find a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to try and push for a lower price, but he's also showing a willingness to compromise.  By increasing his offer slightly, he's indicating that he's serious about getting a deal, but also that he's not willing to overpay. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while still giving Bob a good chance of getting a lower price."
