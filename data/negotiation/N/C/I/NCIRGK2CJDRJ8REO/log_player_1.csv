"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much Bob is willing to pay.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option of selling to John for $150, so I have a baseline for what I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm proposing $160,  which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price, but also indicates I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $140 is only $10 above my minimum acceptable price, it's still a decent deal and I'm not sure how much more I can get from Bob in the remaining rounds.  It's also better than selling to John for $150, as it avoids the hassle of negotiating further and guarantees a sale."
