"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $15,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $13,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there yet. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm offering $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",14000.0,Alice,5,
