"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential value. Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $400000 at this time. This reflects the value I see in the product and my current financial capabilities. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $400000 is significantly lower than its true value. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1750000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $600000, which demonstrates my genuine interest in your product while staying within my financial constraints.  I'm hopeful we can find a mutually agreeable price.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $600000 is still far from what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, but it reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is a step in the right direction, it's still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $750000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my financial limitations. Let's see if we can find a middle ground to close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750000 is still significantly below the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $1000000. This reflects the product's potential while recognizing your budget limitations.  With only a few rounds left, let's make this work.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find common ground.  While $1000000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000, which reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limitations.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.",800000.0,Bob,8,
