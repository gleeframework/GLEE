"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see how much Bob values the product and what counteroffer he might make."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for it just yet. I want to see if I can get a bit more. Bob clearly values the product less than I do, but there's still potential for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to increase his bid."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still higher than my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer slightly to $125. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise and only $5 less than my initial counteroffer.  I'm willing to accept this offer rather than risk further rounds and potentially ending up with John's offer of $120."
