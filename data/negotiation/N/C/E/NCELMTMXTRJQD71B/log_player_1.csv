Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth $100 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  It's a steal at that price!"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $100 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $90 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Highlight Value:** By mentioning that the product is worth $100 to Bob, you remind him of its value and justify the price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below $80."
