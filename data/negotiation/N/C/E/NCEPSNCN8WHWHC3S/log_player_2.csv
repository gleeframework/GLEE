"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above your goal of saving as much money as possible. There's room for negotiation with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within your budget and leaves some room for negotiation.  The goal is to start the negotiation process and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is within your budget and a significant improvement over her initial offer. While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John for $1,500,000 is too high. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a price that's both within your budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
