Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the strategy involved:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Strategy Explanation:**

* **Aiming High:** We start with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,000,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price, appealing to Bob's understanding of its worth.
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:**  Framing the price as a ""fair deal"" encourages Bob to see it as a mutually beneficial agreement rather than a one-sided offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on your negotiation style and how much risk you're willing to take."
