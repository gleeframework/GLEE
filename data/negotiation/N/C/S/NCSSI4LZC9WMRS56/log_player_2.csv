I'm starting with a lower offer of $300,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but I believe it's still a fair starting point. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if we can reach an agreement quickly."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still too high for me. With only one round left, it's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a worse deal.
