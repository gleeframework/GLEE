Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you're interested in. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, her goal is to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $1,190,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but the message framing focuses on ""fairness"" and ""true worth"" to nudge Bob towards considering it.

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, Alice's fallback option ensures she doesn't lose out on the product's inherent value to her."
