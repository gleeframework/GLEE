"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility. While I see the value in this product, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to purchase it for $9,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product offers.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This feels like a fair price point that balances value and affordability for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to close this deal, I can't go below $10,000. This is my final offer - I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your decision.",10000.0,Alice,5,
