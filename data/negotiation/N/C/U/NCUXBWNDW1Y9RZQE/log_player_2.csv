"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $15,000 to her, so she's already making a profit by selling it to me at $19,000. I'd be better off buying it from John for $10,000, which is a much better deal for me.
