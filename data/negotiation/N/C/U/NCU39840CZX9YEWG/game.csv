"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is quite high, and $12,000 is below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",13500.0,Bob,4,
