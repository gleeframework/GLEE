Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $1,500,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,350,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers him a substantial saving compared to my guaranteed sale price. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and framing it as a ""limited-time offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
