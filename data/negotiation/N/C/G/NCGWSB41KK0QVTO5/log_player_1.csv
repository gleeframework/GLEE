{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still gives me a good profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's estimated value, making it appealing to him. At the same time, it's still a decent profit for me.  I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I will accept John's offer of $8,000 if Bob doesn't counter or accepts a price I find unacceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer will bring me a profit of $1,000, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate."
