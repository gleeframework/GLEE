,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I value your continued interest in the product, but $10,000 still doesn't reflect its true worth. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and your budget.",10500.0,Alice,5,
