"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $10,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $11,000.  Would you consider $12,000? This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
