Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This offer takes into account the product's worth while still providing you a good deal."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I'm working with a tight budget.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $1,220,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
 
While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,220,000 is the best move at this point. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and there's a risk Bob could walk away in later rounds.  This secures a good deal now."
