"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, which is a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($120) but still gives me a decent profit. 
* **Friendly opening:** I'm starting the negotiation with a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Testing the waters:** This first offer allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay a higher price. If he's willing to negotiate, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit margin:** While $90 is better than $80 (John's offer), it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($80 minimum).  
* **Negotiation room:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get closer to my target price with another counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** I'm not desperate to sell quickly. By rejecting this offer, I demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting that $100 is a ""good deal"" for Bob reinforces the value of the product.
* **Directness:** Using a clear and concise message avoids unnecessary back and forth."
