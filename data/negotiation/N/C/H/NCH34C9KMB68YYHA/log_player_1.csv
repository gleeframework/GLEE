Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **High starting point:**  Starting at $9,000 anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the value proposition (""worth $10,000 to you"") strengthens the offer's appeal.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the message doesn't explicitly invite bargaining, the tone leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to. 

By setting a price closer to Bob's valuation, Alice increases the likelihood of a sale above her minimum acceptable price ($8,000)."
