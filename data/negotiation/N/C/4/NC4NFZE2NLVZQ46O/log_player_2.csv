"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable item that could be a great asset for your business. This price reflects a significant discount from what I could potentially get from another buyer. I'm confident that it's a fair deal for both of us. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a discount from what she could get from someone else, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You can get the same product from John for a lower price."
