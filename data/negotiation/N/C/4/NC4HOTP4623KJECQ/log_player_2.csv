"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $180. This is far too high. It's best to reject and see if you can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is what it's worth to me.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is still too high. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is better than $180, it's still above my value for the product. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 120}
