"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to counter-offer and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired amount.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, but I also don't want to lose this deal if I can avoid it. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  I'm willing to drop to $825,000. This is a great price for you considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $790,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. We're getting close, but I've already spent several rounds negotiating, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob.  To avoid potentially losing the deal completely, it's best to sell to John at this point and secure the guaranteed $800,000."
