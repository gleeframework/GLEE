Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

This offer is just below Bob's perceived value, giving him a bit of a bargain while still ensuring a good profit for me. It's also a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his perceived value, but it's closer to my initial offer and hopefully will be more appealing than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,000 is still a good profit for me and above my minimum.  Further negotiation might risk losing the sale altogether, so I'll accept his offer."
