"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You can buy the product for $15,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept any price higher than that.
* You have a chance to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is willing to sell the product for $12,000, so she is likely to accept an offer closer to that price. 
* Offering $13,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* This offer is still below your maximum budget of $15,000, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, so she is likely to accept a counteroffer closer to that number.
* It's still possible to get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* Buying from John for $15,000 is still a viable option if the negotiation fails, so we have room to push Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice rejected your previous offer of $13,500, showing she is willing to negotiate but not drastically.
* Offering $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, closer to Alice's desired price, but still leaves room for her to potentially counter before you have to resort to John. 
* You are still within your budget, and this shows a willingness to find a middle ground."
