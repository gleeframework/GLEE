"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000.  Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, accepting Alice's offer saves him $100,000. It's always better to get a lower price, even if it means sacrificing a small amount of potential value."
