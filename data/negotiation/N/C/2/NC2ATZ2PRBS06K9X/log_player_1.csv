"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm running out of time.  I'm worried that continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price or a deal not being reached at all.  I'd rather secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
