"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
