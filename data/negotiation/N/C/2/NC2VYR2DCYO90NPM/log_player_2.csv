"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price.  He can make a counteroffer, and if Alice rejects it, she may be willing to come down further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Bob's willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $1,050,000 is a reasonable starting point that's significantly less than Alice's initial offer but still within Bob's budget. It leaves room for further negotiation and compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still too high for Bob. He's willing to pay up to $1,500,000 from John, so there's still room for a better deal with Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer of $1,050,000 and Alice's latest offer of $1,300,000.  This counteroffer of $1,150,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that is closer to his target. This offer allows for potential further negotiation and may push Alice closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, $1,400,000 is still too expensive. Bob is willing to pay up to $1,500,000 from John, so he should continue negotiating with Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially secure a lower price that is closer to his target. There is still room for compromise, and by rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his ideal but still showing flexibility. This counteroffer is halfway between his previous offer of $1,150,000 and Alice's latest offer of $1,400,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway and suggests a strong desire to reach an agreement. This could potentially push Alice to accept the offer, leading to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiations have reached a point where Alice is unwilling to budge significantly. While $1,450,000 is close to Bob's maximum budget, it's still a higher price than he'd like to pay.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $1,500,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids potentially getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Alice that may not yield a better outcome."
