"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm not quite ready to pay $1500000.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a chance to close a deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  I believe this offer is fair and reflects the value we're both looking for. Let's keep talking.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1150000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
