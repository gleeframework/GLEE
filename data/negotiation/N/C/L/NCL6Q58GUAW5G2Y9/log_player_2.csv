"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You have a higher value for the product ($1,200,000) than Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation.
* Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is too high for you, but you still want to try to get a better deal.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a respectable offer, the product's true value warrants a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still higher than your desired price, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer.
* You are still saving $175,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Continuing to negotiate might lead to further price reductions, but there's no guarantee, and you risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
