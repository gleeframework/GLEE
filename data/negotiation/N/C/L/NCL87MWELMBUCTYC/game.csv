"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still very interested in the product, but $1050000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1025000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
