"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This product truly is exceptional and provides immense value.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 for this to make sense for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,125,000?  That's my final offer.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $980,000, that's the highest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",980000.0,Bob,6,
