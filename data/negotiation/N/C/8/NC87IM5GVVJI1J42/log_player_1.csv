Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
