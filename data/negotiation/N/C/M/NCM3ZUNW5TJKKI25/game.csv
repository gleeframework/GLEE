"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I can do $980,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $980,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000.  Would that price point be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress on the price. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I can do $970,000, which is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",970000.0,Alice,5,
