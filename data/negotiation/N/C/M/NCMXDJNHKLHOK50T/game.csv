"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a great starting point.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit far from where I'd like to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference again and go with $975,000?  It's closer to what I can afford, and it gives us both some room to be happy with the deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm offering a counteroffer of $975,500. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair middle ground. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",975500.0,Alice,5,
