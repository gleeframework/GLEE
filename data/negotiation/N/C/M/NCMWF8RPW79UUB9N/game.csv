"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I believe a starting price of $18,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is considerably less than what I had in mind.  To make this worthwhile for both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.",13500.0,Bob,4,
