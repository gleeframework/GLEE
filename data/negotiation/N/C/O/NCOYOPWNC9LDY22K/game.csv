"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable item that's worth $8,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could we settle on $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to get closer to my target. Can you meet me at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we seem to be getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11,250? That's the best I can do at this point.",11250.0,Alice,7,
