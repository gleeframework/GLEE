I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."

While I'm happy with $12,000, I'd prefer to see if I can get a little bit more from Bob. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept $12,500, as it's a better deal than selling to John for $12,000."
