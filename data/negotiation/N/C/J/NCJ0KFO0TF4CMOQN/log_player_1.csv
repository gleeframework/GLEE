Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1750000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,750,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1800000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to make a good deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's above my minimum and a reasonable compromise.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and it's important to secure a deal."
