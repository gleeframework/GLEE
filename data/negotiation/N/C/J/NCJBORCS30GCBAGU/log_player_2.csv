"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money. 
* **Avoiding John:**  It's better to keep negotiating with Alice, as John's price is your absolute limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still well above her minimum value. 
* **Opening for negotiation:**  The message shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Avoiding John:** This offer keeps you from immediately resorting to John, giving you more leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my asking price. How about $950,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While $950,000 is closer to your ideal price, it's still more than you want to pay. 
* **Continuing negotiation:**  Rejecting this offer gives you more opportunities to lower the price. 
* **John remains a backup:**  You still have a backup option with John, but it's crucial to keep pushing for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and your profit margin. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant move:**  This counteroffer is a smaller step up than before, showing you're serious about getting a deal but not ready to settle for Alice's current offer.
* **Appealing to fairness:** The message emphasizes a fair price for both parties, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Maintaining leverage:** This counteroffer keeps you in a good position to negotiate, while still avoiding John's expensive alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $925,000? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my profit margin. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $925,000 is just slightly above your ideal price point of $900,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While you could reject this offer and counter again, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further. It's possible you could reach an impasse.
* **Avoid risk of John:**  Accepting this offer is a good way to secure the product at a reasonable price while avoiding the risk of having to pay John's higher price.

**Overall, it's a good deal for you and a reasonable profit for Alice.**"
