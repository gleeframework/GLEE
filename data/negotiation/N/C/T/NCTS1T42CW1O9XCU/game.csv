"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer in this range, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and settle on $885,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",885000.0,Bob,6,
