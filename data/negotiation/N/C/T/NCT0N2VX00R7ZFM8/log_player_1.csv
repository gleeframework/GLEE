{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm highlighting the value to both of us to create a sense of fairness and common ground. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies that I'm open to negotiation and ready to hear Bob's thoughts.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll either:

* **Accept a counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum of $1,200,000, I'll accept it to secure the sale.
* **Make a counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Go with John:**  If the negotiation with Bob seems unproductive or if his offers are significantly below my minimum, I'll  stop the negotiation and sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round by making a counteroffer.  I will try to meet him halfway, but I will not go below my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price reflects the product's value while also being within a reasonable range for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering $1,050,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm explicitly stating that this price is a significant compromise on my end,  further highlighting my willingness to negotiate.
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm again referencing the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm using a polite and respectful tone to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to reconsider.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response:

* **Accept Bob's Counteroffer:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer of $1,050,000, I'll accept it and secure the sale.
* **Make Another Counteroffer:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to carefully consider his response and potentially make another counteroffer. I'll try to find a middle ground, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Sell to John:** If Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low, I'll stop the negotiation and sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the compromise we've already made. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $990,000 is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it's still below my acceptable threshold of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me, and I'm not willing to accept that.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round by making a counteroffer. I'll try to meet him halfway again, but I will not go below my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $990,000 is still not a viable option for me. I'm prepared to offer a final compromise of $1,020,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging the compromises we've both made. If this doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately have to move forward with another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm framing this as my final offer, adding pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering $1,020,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,050,000 and Bob's current offer of $990,000.
* **Emphasizing Value and Compromise:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and the concessions I've made.
* **Stating Consequences:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that if he rejects this offer, I'll move on to another buyer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept Bob's Counteroffer:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer of $1,020,000, I'll accept it and secure the sale.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob rejects my offer, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to avoid further negotiation.  I'm now at a point where I'm willing to accept a lower price to close the deal, but I won't go below my minimum."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we've both made compromises, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,005,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,005,000 is closer to my minimum than his previous offers, it's still below my acceptable threshold of $1,200,000.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to further lower my price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
