"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $5,000. I understand that's a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
