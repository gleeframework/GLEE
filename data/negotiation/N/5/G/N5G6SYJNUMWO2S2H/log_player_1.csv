"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price right away, or if we'll need to go through some rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $70 is below my minimum value for the product. While it's tempting to take the deal and avoid further negotiation, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $90. This is a compromise, acknowledging that Bob is not willing to pay my initial price, but still higher than his offer. I believe there's room for us to meet in the middle, especially with several rounds of negotiation still remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $75 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I believe there's a good chance I can secure a higher offer from Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price, in the remaining rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $85.  Since we're now halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'm getting closer to my minimum value and want to see if we can reach a deal. This offer is a clear signal that I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than $75."
