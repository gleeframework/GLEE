"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer to a price point that works for me. Given that you said $14,500 is your final offer, could we settle at $14,000 even? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $14,250? This is my last offer, and I'm not going to go any lower.",14250.0,Alice,7,
