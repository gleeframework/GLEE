"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your confidence in its worth. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000 to see if we can reach an agreement that is acceptable to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $975000. This reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to find common ground.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. I've reviewed my budget once again, and I believe I can accommodate a price closer to your last offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",960000.0,Bob,4,
