"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it valuable, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $850000. Please let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $850000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700000 for this product. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think about $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $700000, but I have to consider the value I've assigned to the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering you the product for $775000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $775000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you consider a price of $750000?  It's a fair compromise that's in the middle of our last two offers.  Let's make this deal happen.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm offering you the product for $760000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",760000.0,Alice,5,
