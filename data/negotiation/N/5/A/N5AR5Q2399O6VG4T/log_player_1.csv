Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've proposed. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your effort in trying to find a middle ground. Given my financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. This is still below my ideal price, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer of $1,550,000 yields a higher profit. It's always best to secure the most favorable deal available."
