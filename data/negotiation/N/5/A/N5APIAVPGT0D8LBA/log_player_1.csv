{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This gives me a decent margin above my minimum value, but also leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $15,000 to Bob, so I'm hoping he'll at least consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more to Bob. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering $18,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over John's offer and I'm confident I can't get much more from Bob.  It's time to close the deal."
