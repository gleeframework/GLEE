Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $850,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a valuable product at a good rate and me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?
