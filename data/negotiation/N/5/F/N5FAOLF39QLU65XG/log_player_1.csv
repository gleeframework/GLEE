Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fantastic deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I'm inviting Bob to respond with a counteroffer, signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:** If the negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive, I'll consider John's offer to secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and show that I'm not desperate for a deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap and reach a price that is closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $850,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a valuable product at a good rate and me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but showing willingness to compromise by reducing my price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to reinforce its worth and justify my counteroffer.
* **Fair Price Framing:** I'm framing the counteroffer as ""fair"" to both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and encouraging a positive response.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion, signaling my flexibility.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's reaction to my counteroffer. 
* **Further Negotiation:** Based on his response, I'll decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I'll reconsider John's offer to ensure a sale."
