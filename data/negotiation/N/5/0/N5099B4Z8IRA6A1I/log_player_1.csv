Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant amount for me, but leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, this offer should be enticing to him while still ensuring I get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to make a counteroffer to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price that's closer to my target than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be agreeable to him, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer of $12,000 is getting closer to my bottom line, but it's still below what I'd like.  At this point, I'm worried that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a lower offer from Bob. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale to John for $10,000."
