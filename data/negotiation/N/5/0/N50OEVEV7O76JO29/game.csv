"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $8,750. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,250, which is closer to your offer and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at $9,000, I'd be happy to make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
