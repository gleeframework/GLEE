"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and well above what I need. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  How about $950,000?  This still leaves a significant profit margin for you and is a much more attractive price for me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is my absolute bottom line. This is still a great deal for you, allowing a significant profit, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
