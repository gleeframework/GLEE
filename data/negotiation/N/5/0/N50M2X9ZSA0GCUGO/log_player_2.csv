"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and well above what I need. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is my absolute bottom line. This is still a great deal for you, allowing a significant profit, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $1,050,000**, which is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price ($1,500,000) and still allows Bob a substantial profit margin.
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John increases.**  Alice's message indicates that $1,050,000 is her bottom line, so it's unlikely she'll budge much further.
* **Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a much lower price than John's.**  This ensures Bob gets the product while saving a considerable amount of money."
