"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth far more than its cost.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth, given its potential impact on your business.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
