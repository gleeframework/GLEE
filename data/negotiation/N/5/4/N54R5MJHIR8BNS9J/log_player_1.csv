{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you as you value it at $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum but still leaves room for potential bargaining.  It also emphasizes the value Bob would get from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  I'm confident this is still a great deal for you considering your valuation."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $9,250. I'm willing to accept this price, as it's above my minimum of $8,000 and still a good deal for me.  It's also a good compromise, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
