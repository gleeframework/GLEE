Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $80, which is essential.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **It shows you're open to discussion:** The message implies flexibility and invites Bob to participate in a negotiation. 

By offering a price slightly closer to your minimum than Bob's maximum, you create an initial space for negotiation, potentially leading to a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:** Bob's offer is closer to your minimum ($80) than your initial offer ($100).  This indicates he might be willing to go higher. 
* **Negotiation is key:** Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer of $100. This keeps the negotiation moving and aims for a better outcome than selling to John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just a little too low for me. Would you be willing to go to $95? I think that's a fair price that's beneficial to both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** By offering $95, you're splitting the difference between your previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows you're willing to compromise. 
* **Reasoning for the offer:**  The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit, making your counteroffer more persuasive. 
* **Keeping negotiations alive:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and increases the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable price."
