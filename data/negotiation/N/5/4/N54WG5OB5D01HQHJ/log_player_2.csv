Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to get a bit closer to my desired price. I can offer it to you for $13,750. This is the last compromise I'm willing to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down significantly further. She's signaled that $13,750 is her bottom line.  While continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, it's getting risky. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price of $10,000."
