Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to get as close to my minimum as possible.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below $150, as I have another buyer willing to pay that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$140 is still below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm willing to come down a little, but $155 is still a fair price for me, considering my minimum and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've negotiated as much as I can with Bob, and his final offer is still below my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get $155, John is a guaranteed sale at $150.  So, I'll sell to John."
