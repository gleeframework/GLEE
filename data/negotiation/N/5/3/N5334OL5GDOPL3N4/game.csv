"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'd like to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us and would be a great opportunity for us to do business together.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $950,000.  This price is still significantly less than your asking price but represents a good value for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
