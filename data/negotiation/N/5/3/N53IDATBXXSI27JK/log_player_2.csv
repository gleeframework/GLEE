"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to you, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.** This is higher than Alice's value of $1,200,000, but still lower than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **You can get a better deal from John.**  Even though Alice's offer is better than John's, your goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John.**  This will result in a higher price, but it's still within your budget."
