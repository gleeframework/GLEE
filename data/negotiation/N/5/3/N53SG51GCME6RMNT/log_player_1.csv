Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm asking for $150. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows you to potentially gain more than the guaranteed $100 from John.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob doesn't accept $150, the initial offer opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, giving you a chance to still get more than $100. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright, the potential reward of a higher sale price makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
