"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $12000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford $8000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate closer to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $8750? This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford right now. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8750 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $9000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $8000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8800? That's just a bit above my budget, but it's a good compromise that reflects the value of the product to me.",8800.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $8800 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $8900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement, so I'm willing to make one final offer. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",8900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  How about $8850?  It's a small difference, but it would make a big difference to me.  Let's see if we can find a way to close the deal.",8850.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that $8850 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $8950. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $8000. If we can't come to an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options.
