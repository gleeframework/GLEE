"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $9,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This still represents a significant value for you, and it gives us both a fair deal.  Let's make this happen.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,875?  That would give us both a good deal and move us closer to an agreement.",9875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still open to working with you, but $9,875 is still a bit too low.  Let's compromise at $10,000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
