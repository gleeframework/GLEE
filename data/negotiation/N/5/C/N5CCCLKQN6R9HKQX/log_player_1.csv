Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $9,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  $9,500 is still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This still represents a significant value for you, and it gives us both a fair deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,875?  That would give us both a good deal and move us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,875 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher number. I'll counter with a price closer to $10,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still open to working with you, but $9,875 is still a bit too low.  Let's compromise at $10,000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
