Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and while my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to offer it to you at $1,150,000 for a limited time before considering other offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($1,150,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. It positions the offer as a potential ""win"" for him.
* **Confidentiality:**  Mentioning a ""confidential"" minimum price prevents Bob from anchoring negotiations too low and emphasizes that the offer is time-sensitive.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring the sale at a price above our minimum."
