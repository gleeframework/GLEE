"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the exclusive deal, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for us. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach your ceiling, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
