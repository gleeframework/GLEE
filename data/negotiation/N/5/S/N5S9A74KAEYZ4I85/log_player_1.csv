Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I offer it to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This gives you a chance to benefit significantly from its acquisition."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, we want to maximize your profit. Offering it slightly below his maximum valuation ($1,400,000) increases the likelihood of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The presence of John, willing to pay your minimum acceptable price, provides a safety net. This allows for a more assertive initial offer to Bob.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:**  By presenting the offer as exclusive, it adds a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he rejects, subtly encouraging a quicker acceptance."
