"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it will be extremely valuable for you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, as I understand it's worth that much to you. Let's make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $18,000 is closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a high-quality product that will bring you significant value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a real desire from you to have this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work. How about we split the difference and agree on $14,000? That reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true value of what I'm offering.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
