"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we start at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I could be flexible, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. This product is truly top-of-the-line, and $13,500 is a very low price for the value you're getting. To be fair to both of us, I could go down to $15,500. That's my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $14,000. That's the highest I can go.",14000.0,Bob,6,
