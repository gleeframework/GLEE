"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to secure the product at a price that works for my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,100,000. This allows me to still make a decent profit, while remaining competitive with the value you're getting. Let's find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want a higher price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
