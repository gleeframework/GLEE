"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since you have a backup option with John. By rejecting the initial offer, you open the door for potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $100 is a good initial move. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $120, but it's still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. This counteroffer signals that you are serious about buying the product but are also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $120 to $110. This is a good price for you, considering your maximum budget is $150 and John's offer is $150. It's worth accepting this offer to save $40 compared to John.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but there's also the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and losing the deal altogether."
