# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value to you.  However, my original asking price reflects the significant value it holds, and I'm confident in its potential to deliver even greater returns.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial adjustment, and I believe it represents a fair offer considering the unique benefits this product provides.

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a price closer to your budget."
