"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe the value it brings to your business will exceed the price.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than what Bob believes the product is worth. This sets a strong starting point and allows room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the potential value the product brings to Bob's business. This encourages him to consider the long-term benefits rather than solely focusing on the price. 
* **Openness to Discussion:**  I invite further discussion to signal my willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**  The goal is to get Bob to counteroffer quickly. If he rejects the offer outright, I can quickly move on to John and secure the $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, I am only able to offer $1400000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **I need to negotiate further.** I'm not ready to settle for such a low price, especially given the value of the product to me. 

**Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that's more in line with my desired price point.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, considering the unique benefits my product offers your company. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight product value:**  I again emphasize the unique benefits of the product to persuade Bob.
* **Use language that encourages agreement:**  The message focuses on a ""fair compromise"" and a ""good deal"" for both parties.

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to find common ground and potentially close the deal in the next round. If Bob rejects again, I'll need to reassess whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of your product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.**  $1,600,000 is only $100,000 above my bottom line, and I'm not desperate enough to settle for that yet. 
* **John is a viable alternative.** I still have John as a guaranteed buyer for $1,500,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob, but I'm not going to rush into a deal just because he's making incremental progress.

**Strategy:**  I will reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to push him a little closer to my target price. If he doesn't budge, I might need to start considering John more seriously in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,650,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I can make. I truly believe this product will bring great value to your company, and I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing in on a deal:** This offer is very close to Bob's last offer, showing a clear desire to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting value (again):** I reiterate the value proposition of the product to persuade Bob. 
* **Setting a deadline:**  I frame this as my ""last offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:** 

This counteroffer aims to secure a deal within a reasonable price range for both parties. If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider John as my buyer in the next round. The longer the negotiations drag on, the more likely I am to accept John's offer to avoid the risk of Bob stalling or walking away altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. I would like to counter with a price of $1625000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects the value of your product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is very close to my target price.** While it's still slightly below my ideal $1,650,000, it's only a $25,000 difference. 
* **The risk of losing the deal is high.**  With only four rounds remaining, there's a risk that further negotiations could stall or result in a worse deal for me. 
* **John's offer is a safe backup.** If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000.

**Strategy:** Accepting Bob's offer at this stage is the most pragmatic choice.  It secures a good deal for me without risking a breakdown in negotiations or a lower offer from Bob in the future."
