Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high gives us some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **Secure the Sale:**  While we could try for even higher, there's a risk of alienating Bob and losing the sale. This price point is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a deal. 
 
This strategy aims to capitalize on Bob's higher valuation while still guaranteeing a profitable outcome for you (Alice)."
