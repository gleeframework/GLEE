"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. It's a great price, considering its value to me is at least $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $12,500 is better than John's price of $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer. 

Alice has already stated her product is worth at least $10,000 to her, which means there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can explore a lower price without committing to Alice's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value still above Bob's minimum:** The price of $11,000 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000, so it's a reasonable deal.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If Bob rejects again, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. It's possible the negotiation could stall, forcing Bob to pay John's higher price.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $11,000 is the best choice to save money while still getting the product within budget."
