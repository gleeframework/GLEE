"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $12000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  This would allow me to make a fair deal, and I believe it's still a great price for you given the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
