"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting high, at $1,450,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping the deal open. By starting with a high offer, I leave myself room to negotiate while still being attractive to Bob.  The offer is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, so there is a good chance he'll accept.  If he doesn't, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. 
* **Reasoning:**  I have 8 more rounds, and I'm still in a stronger position. By rejecting, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer, potentially driving up the final sale price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial $1,450,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, reducing my offer by $50,000. This shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for me.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and highlighting the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is a test to see if Bob is serious about the deal. If he's willing to meet me halfway, I'll be happy to accept. If not, we can continue negotiating.  

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to re-evaluate his seriousness about the deal and potentially consider moving closer to his offer or even selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. That's my final offer for now.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:** While Bob has come up a bit, his offer is still below my minimum. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm still confident I can secure a better price. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm in a strong position.  While Bob's finality is a slight pressure tactic, I'm not in a hurry to sell.  I'll continue to negotiate and potentially drive the price closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my previous offer of $1,400,000. I'll gauge how willing Bob is to compromise before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $1,320,000 is a step closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but this is my final offer for this round. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,350,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but it also shows that I'm not willing to go too far below my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone while stating my finality for this round. This adds a bit of pressure while leaving room for further negotiation in future rounds.
* **Strategy:** I'm using this round to gauge how serious Bob is about the deal. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I'm willing to come down further or if I should start considering selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I've successfully secured a price above my minimum.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the situation.  If he's unwilling to budge, I may have to consider selling to John, as I'm running out of rounds."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,290,000. That's my best and final offer for now.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still have 4 rounds left, and I'm not in a desperate situation.  I'm confident I can secure a slightly higher price.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm going to continue the negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my previous offer of $1,350,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price slightly higher than $1,290,000.  However, I will need to assess if I should consider selling to John if Bob continues to refuse to budge."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,320,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset.  Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1320000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing my offer to $1,320,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,350,000 and Bob's offer of $1,290,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise and meet Bob in the middle.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and highlighting the value of the product. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that we close the deal now.
* **Strategy:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiations. With only 3 rounds left, I'm trying to reach a final agreement with Bob, while still securing a price above my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a good price and secured a sale.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John. With only two rounds left, the chance of getting a better offer from Bob is diminishing, and I don't want to risk losing out on a deal."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,320,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:**  While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is getting very close to John's offer of $1,200,000.  I'm running out of time, and with only 2 rounds left, there's a significant chance Bob will refuse my next counteroffer. 
* **Reasoning:**  I don't want to risk losing a deal entirely.  While I'm not thrilled about selling to John, it's a secure sale that guarantees me a reasonable profit. 

**Strategy:**

This decision prioritizes certainty and securing a sale. It's a calculated risk to accept John's offer now rather than continue with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
