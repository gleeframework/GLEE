Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer allows for a significant profit for me while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. I'm also being upfront about the value of the product to him, which might encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could accept and make a profit, I believe I can get a better price. I will counteroffer and try to negotiate closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is worth significantly more to you than that.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $850,000? This price is still very fair, and it allows for a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $775,000?  It's a reasonable compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm starting to feel like he's just trying to lowball me. While $775,000 is better than his initial offer, it's not enough for me.  John is a guaranteed sale at $800,000, which is a safer and more profitable option at this point."
