"Alice, $2000000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $1000000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1000000 is too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1750000, but I'm still limited to $1250000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a significant step towards a deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but $1250000 is still too low. Let's meet in the middle at $1500000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1350000. This is a fair price considering our previous offers, and it's the best I can do at the moment. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
