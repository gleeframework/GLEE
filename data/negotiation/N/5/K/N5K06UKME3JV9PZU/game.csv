"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. This seems like a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is far below the value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the significant value this product offers, while still giving you a fair deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you consider $1,100,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,150,000. This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you.  Let's close this deal and get you the benefit of this amazing product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, this product will be a benefit to my business, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise to finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
