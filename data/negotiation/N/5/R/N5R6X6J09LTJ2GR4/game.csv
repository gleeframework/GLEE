"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to the value I believe the product is worth to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $10,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value I believe the product is worth to me.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,750 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a small difference from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal, I'm ready to finalize it.",10900.0,Alice,5,
