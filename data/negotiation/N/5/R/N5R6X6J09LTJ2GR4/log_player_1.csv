Let's close this deal, I'm ready to finalize it."", ""product_price"": 10900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $10,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value I believe the product is worth to me.

While I'm still slightly below my desired price, Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range. Accepting this offer will ensure a sale, and I believe the potential for further negotiation is limited.  It's important to balance potential gains with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
