Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it's a great deal and will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. It's worth more to her than it is to me, so there's room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to pay $130, and I'm sure we can find a compromise somewhere in the middle. I'll reject her offer and see if she's willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $155 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to pay $140 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
