Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $975,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is tempting, you are close to your limit. It's worth risking one more round to try and bring the price down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're close to your target, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's the best chance to close this deal quickly. Let's both be reasonable here."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $925,000, so I'm counteroffering at $937,500. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Although Alice is getting closer, the price is still too high for you. It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John for a guaranteed price of $800,000.  You've already invested several rounds and Alice is showing signs of being stubborn."
