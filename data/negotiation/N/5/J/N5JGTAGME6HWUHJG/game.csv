"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $975,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let's try to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're close to your target, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's the best chance to close this deal quickly. Let's both be reasonable here.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $925,000, so I'm counteroffering at $937,500. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",937500.0,Alice,7,
