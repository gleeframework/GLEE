"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? That's still a good price for a product worth $15,000 to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $15,500. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,250 for the product. Can we meet at $14,750?",14750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $14,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference and go with $15,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go.",15000.0,Alice,7,
