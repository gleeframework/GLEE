"Alice, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I understand you value the product highly, but I'm only willing to pay up to $8,500. This is my best offer. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $9,500. This is still a great deal considering the value the product brings, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500.  My final offer is $9,250.  This is a good price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $9,250 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,750.
