"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is far above his budget. He can make a counteroffer in the next round or buy from John for a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I understand you value the product highly, but I'm only willing to pay up to $8,500. This is my best offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. He is still $2,000 over his ideal price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $9,500. This is still a great deal considering the value the product brings, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is getting closer to his budget, he can still try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer.  He is still $1,500 over his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500.  My final offer is $9,250.  This is a good price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,250 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,750. This is still a great deal considering the value the product brings, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While he could continue negotiating with Alice, he has already made several counteroffers, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to drop her price significantly. 

It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John at $8,000, as this is within his budget and saves him $1,750 compared to Alice's current offer."
