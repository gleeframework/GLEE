"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80. It's best to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
