{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a significant drop from Alice's $95 and falls within my budget. While I'd prefer to pay closer to my $80 limit, I'm starting low to see if there's room for negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still above my maximum budget of $80. I'm going to continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  It's worth trying another counteroffer since I still have plenty of rounds left."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to my budget than previous offers, I'm still willing to spend $80.  Since Alice is not willing to budge on my price, I'm going to buy the product from John.  I've already established a set price with John, and it saves me further negotiating rounds."
