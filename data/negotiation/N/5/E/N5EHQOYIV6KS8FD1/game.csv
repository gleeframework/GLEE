,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and leaves some room for profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately not enough for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This still allows you to make a profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm offering $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied. Let's try to finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal and move on.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,090,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm offering $1,080,000, which is a fair compromise and ensures both of us get a good deal. It's time to finalize this deal, let's make it happen.",1080000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,085,000. This is a fair compromise and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's reach a final agreement on this.",1085000.0,Alice,7,
