"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $90 is a little higher than I'm willing to go. How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $80? That's my absolute max, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price.",80.0,Bob,4,
