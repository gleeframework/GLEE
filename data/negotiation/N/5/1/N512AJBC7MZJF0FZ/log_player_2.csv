"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond its worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially secure a good deal.
* **Signaling Interest:** While the offer is low, it shows Alice you are interested in the product and willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's a significant gap between $8,000 and Alice's asking price, allowing for counteroffers and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice moved closer to your acceptable range, $14,000 is still above your maximum price and what John offers.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's potential to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have the safety net of John's $12,000 offer if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate upwards but are still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $10,000 puts you below your maximum price but above the midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's current price. This could encourage her to move closer to your range. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  You're still a significant amount below her asking price, reminding her that you have other options (John)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept it if it means closing the deal quickly.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Within Budget:** Alice's offer of $10,000 is below your maximum price of $12,000.
* **Significant Savings:** You're saving $2,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you *might* be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the potential savings are probably not worth the risk of Alice backing out or another buyer emerging."
