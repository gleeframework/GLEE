"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy but $950,000 is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $825,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $760,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $795,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",795000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $795,000 is pushing my absolute limit. I can do $775,000, but that's the best I can offer. ",775000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $775,000 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $790,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",790000.0,Alice,7,
