"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is a better price than John's $150, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $130 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  This strategy aims to quickly find a middle ground and avoid too many rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $127.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $127.50 is a good price for Bob. This is a reasonable compromise considering the time spent negotiating. There's no guarantee that Bob can get a lower price in the next rounds, and accepting now ensures a deal within Bob's budget."
