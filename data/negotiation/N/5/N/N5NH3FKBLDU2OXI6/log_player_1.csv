Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:** $12,000 is still a significant amount less than what it's worth to me, but it's also within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay, considering his valuation of $8,000.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation amicable. 

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer again. I'll gauge his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation stalls, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  While $9,000 is a decent profit, it's still significantly lower than my target of $15,000. There's still room to negotiate.
* **Evaluating Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is a good sign that he is interested, but it's still below my preferred price. 
* **Room for a Counteroffer:**  I can likely find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a compromise that brings me closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is my absolute minimum. Let's split the difference and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintain a Profit:**  $10,000 is still a good profit for me, considering my minimum is $15,000. 
* **Clear Message:** My message is direct and sets a clear expectation for Bob. I'm not willing to go lower than $10,000.

**Strategy:**

* **Positive Negotiation:** This approach keeps the negotiation amicable and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Setting Boundaries:** I'm establishing a firm price point to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth. 
* **Prepared for Rejection:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to accept his next offer or sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can we meet at $9500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $9,500 is only $500 away from my previous counteroffer of $10,000. This means I'm close to my target and the negotiation is nearing its end.
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob has shown that he's serious about buying the product by increasing his offer.
* **Risk of Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and I would have to sell to John at my minimum price of $15,000. 

**Strategy:**

It's more advantageous to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale, even though it's slightly less than my ideal price.  This minimizes the risk of losing the deal and ensures I make a decent profit."
