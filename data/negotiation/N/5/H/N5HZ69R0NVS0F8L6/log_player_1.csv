"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to get as close to Bob's maximum value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is higher than Bob's stated value, it's still below my minimum. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's value, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, he'll see that it's a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is still below my minimum, it's getting closer and I'm concerned that further negotiation may lead to a lower price.  I'll accept this offer to ensure a sale."
