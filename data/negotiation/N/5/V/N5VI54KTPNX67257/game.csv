"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still a bit far off from what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to accept $1,125,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,125,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This is a final offer, and if you're serious about acquiring the product, I encourage you to consider it.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,175,000 is closer, I'm still a little hesitant.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000? This would be my final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
