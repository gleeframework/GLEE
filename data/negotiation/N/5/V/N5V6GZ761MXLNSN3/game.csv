"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still feeling a bit stretched. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000. I think it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
