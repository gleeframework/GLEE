"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate and can potentially get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your desired range. You can still try to negotiate further, potentially reaching a price closer to your target.  It's not wise to buy from John yet, as you can potentially get a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still feeling a bit stretched. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000. I think it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has lowered her price again, but it's still slightly above your desired range.  You can still try to negotiate further, and potentially reach a price closer to your target. Remember, you're looking to save as much money as possible, and it's not yet clear if Alice will budge further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  I'm very close to my budget limit.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're close to your budget limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within your budget and only slightly above John's offer. While you could try to negotiate further, it's a good price for the product and you risk losing the deal if you continue to counteroffer.  With only three rounds remaining, it's likely that Alice won't budge further."
