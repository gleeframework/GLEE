""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit on what I can spend. How about we start the negotiations at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and the product's actual value. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet halfway at $1,850,000?"",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my offer, but $1,850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could go up to $1,250,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering it meets you closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly below the product's value and your minimum. Let's see if we can negotiate him up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to a realistic price point, it's still a significant gap from what I can accept.  To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can feel it!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows how serious I am about getting this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting close, but it's still worth pushing a bit further. Bob's offer is now approaching the guaranteed sale price from John, but there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to move closer to my asking price. I can tell you're serious about this. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product."",
