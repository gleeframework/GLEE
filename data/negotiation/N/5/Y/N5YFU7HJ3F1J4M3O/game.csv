"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value.  I'm willing to offer you $10,000 for it. This price is still above what the product is worth to you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to me is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
