Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand where you're coming from. To be completely transparent, I do have other options for purchasing a similar product. However, I value this negotiation and believe we can still reach an agreement. My final offer is $980,000.  This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While selling to John would net us the full $1,200,000, Bob's final offer of $980,000 is still a significant amount. It's unlikely Bob will go any higher, and we risk him walking away completely if we push further. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
