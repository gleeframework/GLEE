Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge below $90.  Since you can get the product for $80 from John, it's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed better price."
