"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a higher price than Alice's value for the product.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's value as possible. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price and demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously.  It's also a safe bet, considering Bob can always purchase from John for $1,500,000 if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above what Bob would be willing to pay if he had to buy from John.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise. This counteroffer is a slight increase from the previous one, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  It's still a significant discount from Alice's offer, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above what Bob would be willing to pay if he had to buy from John. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer gives Bob another opportunity to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to Alice's value for the product. This counteroffer reflects a willingness to meet Alice's price while still securing a good deal for himself. If Alice accepts, Bob achieves his goal of saving money. If Alice rejects, Bob has a few more rounds to try and negotiate further. It's a calculated risk, as Bob could always buy from John, but this offer maximizes Bob's potential savings."
