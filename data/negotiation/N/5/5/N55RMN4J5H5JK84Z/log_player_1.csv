Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. It's worth more to me than that. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately below what I'm willing to accept. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This demonstrates my seriousness about the deal while acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
