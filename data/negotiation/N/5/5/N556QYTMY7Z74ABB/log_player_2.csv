"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

You can do better than $12,000. You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000? It's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

$11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and it's likely Alice will not go any lower.  It's a good compromise."
