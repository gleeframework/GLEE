"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but not ridiculously high. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a profit. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob. This helps build rapport and avoid a confrontational tone. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Offering $17,000 gives me a little wiggle room if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

**Remember:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.  This is just the first offer, and I'll adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I still have 8 rounds left, so I can continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price.  
* **John is a safety net:**  While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation fails. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for compromise. The goal is to find a price that both Bob and I can be happy with."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This price still allows me to make a fair profit and reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $17,000 to $14,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my reasoning by mentioning fair profit and product value. This helps Bob understand my position and encourages him to meet me halfway.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I keep the message friendly and open to further discussion. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my compromise and accept the offer. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary, keeping in mind the potential sale to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  With 6 rounds remaining, there's still room to try and get a slightly better price. 
* **John is a backup:** I'm aware I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at this price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price between $13,500 and $15,000.  I want to see if we can find a mutually acceptable middle ground without losing out on too much potential profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're close on price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,250. This shows I'm serious about making this deal happen.  Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's precisely in the middle of Bob's last offer ($13,500) and my previous offer ($15,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Positive and enthusiastic:** The message remains positive and emphasizes my desire to close the deal. This helps keep the negotiation friendly and focused.
* **Emphasize the finality:**  I'm using phrases like ""meet you halfway"" and ""make this deal happen"" to imply that this is a good final offer and encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob. However, I am prepared to keep negotiating if necessary, always keeping the option to sell to John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13750 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to minimum:**  While $13,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a bit below where I'd like to be.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  With 4 rounds remaining, there's still room to negotiate. It's unlikely we'll get to a significantly higher price, but there's potential to close the gap slightly.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept anything below that. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $13,750, perhaps $14,000, to see if we can reach a final agreement. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also aware of the potential sale to John, which provides me with a safety net."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see we're very close! To show I'm committed to making this happen, I'm willing to go down to $14,000. It's a great price for both of us, and it allows me to keep my end of the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final compromise:** This offer represents a final compromise, close to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping it will be enough to close the deal.
* **Strong language:** Using phrases like ""committed to making this happen"" and ""great price for both of us"" adds pressure and highlights the value of the deal.
* **Focus on finality:**  I am emphasizing that this is a good price for both of us and pushing Bob to accept to close the deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping Bob will see the value of this final offer and accept. However, I'm aware that I can always sell to John if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close, but not close enough:** Bob's offer of $13,800 is very close to my minimum, but still a bit below where I'd like to be. 
* **Risk of losing more:** With only 2 rounds left, there's a significant risk that Bob will continue to push for a lower price, potentially even lower than my minimum.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees $15,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer and within my acceptable range.

**Decision:**

Given the risk of getting a lower price and the fact that John's offer is secure, I'm choosing to sell the product to John. This ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which could potentially lead to a lower price."
