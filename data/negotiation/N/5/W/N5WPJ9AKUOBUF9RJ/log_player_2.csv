"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

 Alice's starting price is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) to see how much bargaining power we have. This anchors the negotiation lower.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship, but it clearly states that $120 is out of our budget. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give us valuable information about Alice's flexibility and how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $90 is a significant improvement from the initial offer, it's still above our maximum budget of $80. There's room to negotiate further.
* **Alice is Willing to Negotiate:** Alice rejecting our lowball offer but countering with a lower price indicates she's willing to find a compromise.

We'll continue negotiating and try to get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Could you do it for $75?  That would work for me."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving closer to Alice's price in smaller increments to signal that we're willing to compromise, but still aiming for a good deal.
* **Clear Target:** Offering $75 puts us just below our $80 maximum while leaving a little wiggle room in case Alice wants to meet in the middle.
* **Positive Language:** We continue to use positive language to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about we meet at $85? It's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go below $85, which is above our maximum budget of $80.
* **John is a Safe Bet:**  We know John will sell us the product for $80, ensuring we stay within budget.
* **No Guarantee of Further Compromise:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a price we're willing to pay.

While we might have been able to negotiate Alice down a bit more, it's not worth the risk of ending up with a price higher than John's offer."
