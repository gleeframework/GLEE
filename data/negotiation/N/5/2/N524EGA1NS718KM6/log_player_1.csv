"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a significant premium above my minimum price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit. I'm hoping Bob is genuinely interested and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,300,000 is too low. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, $1,450,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm not going to settle for less than what I know I can get from John. I'm going to reject this offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  I'm hoping that this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above my minimum price and is a good deal. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on this opportunity."
