"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price reflects the quality and benefits the product offers. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering the product for $120. While this is a good deal, you can potentially get it for a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open to negotiate further with her or purchase from John if you can't get a lower price from Alice."
