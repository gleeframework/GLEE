"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $85 right now.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $85, so I'm offering it to you for $102.50. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $102.50 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $97.50, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",97.5,Alice,5,
