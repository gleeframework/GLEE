Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $10,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob is firm at $10,000, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.  It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
