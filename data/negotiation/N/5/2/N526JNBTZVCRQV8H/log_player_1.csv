Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is slightly above Bob's valuation, giving him some room to negotiate while still leaving me some profit.  I'll keep an eye on his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for $7,500. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly low, and I'm starting to feel like the negotiation isn't going anywhere.  At this point, John is a sure thing for $8,000. I'm not willing to risk a further drop in price with Bob, so I'll sell to John."
