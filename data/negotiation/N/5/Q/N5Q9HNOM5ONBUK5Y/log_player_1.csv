"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I have 8 rounds left and the potential to get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering its value to me. Let's find a compromise!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I have 6 rounds left to potentially get a better price. I want to see if I can convince Bob to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering you the product for $8,125.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me."", ""product_price"": 8125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to go up slightly, how about $7,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,900 is better than the previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I have 4 rounds left, and with each round, the risk of selling to John for $10,000 increases. I want to see if I can push Bob just a little higher before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we compromise at $8,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the final offer I can make.  If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8000}
