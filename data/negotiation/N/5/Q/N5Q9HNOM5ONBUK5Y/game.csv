"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering its value to me. Let's find a compromise!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering you the product for $8,125.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",8125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to go up slightly, how about $7,900?",7900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we compromise at $8,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the final offer I can make.  If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Alice,7,
