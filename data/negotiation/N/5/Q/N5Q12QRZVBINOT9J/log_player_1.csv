{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  It's a great deal and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, what do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's find a middle ground. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 for this unique product.  This is a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $11500. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's getting close to my minimum value, but I'm running out of rounds and I'm not sure Bob will budge much further.  I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
