"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. It's a truly unique item with benefits you won't find elsewhere. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  Would you consider $875,000? That's a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down significantly enough to make it worth continuing the negotiation. John's offer of $800,000 is your upper limit, and it's better to secure that price than risk Alice not budging further."
