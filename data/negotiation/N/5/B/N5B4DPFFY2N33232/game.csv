"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. It's a truly unique item with benefits you won't find elsewhere. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's true worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that the product has unique value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  Would you consider $875,000? That's a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to reach a deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
