"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This reflects the product's true value.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,175,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is closer to the product's value to you, but still a good deal for me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While I value your offer,  I'm still seeking a price that better reflects the potential return on this product.  Would you consider $1,112,500?",1112500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your optimism about the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced that $1,112,500 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm also willing to consider a compromise. How about $1,075,000? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
