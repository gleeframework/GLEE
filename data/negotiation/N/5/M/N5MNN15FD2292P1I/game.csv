"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This gives you a fair price and me a good return. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
