"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the value in this product. However, $1,800,000 is still a significant gap from my initial assessment. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This price reflects the true potential of the product for your specific needs.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,100,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this price is more in line with my financial constraints and still reflects the product's value.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I want to make this work.  However, $1,600,000 significantly undervalues what this product can do for your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000, but that's my absolute best offer.  Let me know if we have a deal.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I expect to get from the product.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
