Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $120 is a good starting point, as it's closer to the product's value to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, suggesting a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  By stating ""What do you think?"", I invite Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Knowing my floor:** I'm aware of John's $80 offer, so I won't go below that, but I'm aiming for a higher price to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:** While $100 is a decent price, it's still below my target range. There's a good chance I can negotiate a higher price.
* **Using John as leverage:** Knowing John's offer provides me with a safety net, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Building on the existing negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Offering $110 shows I'm willing to compromise while still getting closer to my target price.
* **Highlighting value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces its worth and justifies the price.
* **Staying firm:**  I'm not going lower than $110 as I'm aware of John's offer and don't want to lose out on profit."
