"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get the product from John for $150, so you can afford to be a bit more aggressive with Alice.  There's room to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
