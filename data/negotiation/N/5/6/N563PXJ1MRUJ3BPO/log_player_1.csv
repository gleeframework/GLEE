"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering my budget and what I've researched about similar products on the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to go with his $1,000,000, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll see if I can negotiate him up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which still reflects the value and potential of this product.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,050,000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm prepared to make one final concession and offer the product to you for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I'm trying to be fair, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While I'm confident I could eventually negotiate a higher price with Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse.  The risk of continuing to negotiate and ending up with nothing is too high.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to lose this opportunity."
