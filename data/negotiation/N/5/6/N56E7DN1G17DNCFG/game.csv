"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has even greater potential for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping for a bit more to reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still thinking that $1,200,000 is a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price or even consider going lower?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're committed to $1,200,000.  While I value your interest, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,225,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,237,500?  I'm sure we can both be happy with this compromise, and finally get this deal done.",1237500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,237,500. I'm willing to offer $1,225,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
