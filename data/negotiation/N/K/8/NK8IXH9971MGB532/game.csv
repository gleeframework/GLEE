"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to negotiate. I'm proposing $1,550,000, which is still a good deal for you, and allows me to recoup a reasonable amount of the value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
