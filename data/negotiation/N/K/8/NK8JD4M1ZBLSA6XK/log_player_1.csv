Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more reasonable price. How about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for anything close to that. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is simply not enough. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a profit and gives you a good deal on a valuable product. Consider it."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit high for my budget.  I could go up to $950,000. That's a significant offer and reflects my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will counter with a higher price in the next round. It's important for me to maximize my profit, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is still far from what this product is worth. I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,100,000 is my final offer. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you call that your final offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's make this simple: $1,000,000. It's my final offer, and it's a fair deal considering John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already wasted several rounds and am unlikely to get a better offer from Bob.  John is a guaranteed sale at a much higher price, so I'll take his offer."
