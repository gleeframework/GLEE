"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more reasonable price. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is simply not enough. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a profit and gives you a good deal on a valuable product. Consider it.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit high for my budget.  I could go up to $950,000. That's a significant offer and reflects my serious interest in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is still far from what this product is worth. I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,100,000 is my final offer. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you call that your final offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's make this simple: $1,000,000. It's my final offer, and it's a fair deal considering John's offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
