# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Perhaps we can settle on something closer to $800,000? How about $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, we're still quite a ways off from a price that reflects the value of this product. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her minimum price ($1,200,000). It's clear she won't go below this. Since you can buy the product from John for $800,000, it's in your best interest to cut off negotiations and buy from John. You'll save a significant amount of money."
