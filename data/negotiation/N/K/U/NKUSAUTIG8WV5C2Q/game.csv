"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about $10,000? That feels like a good compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer of $10,000. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $10,500 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $10,500, which would be $11,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,7,
