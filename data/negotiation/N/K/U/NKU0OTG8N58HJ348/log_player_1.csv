Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and the potential to earn significantly more than your minimum price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value gives you space to negotiate downwards if he counters. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who is willing to pay your minimum price. This knowledge allows you to be bolder in your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in negotiations and that Bob is genuinely interested in the product."
