"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you think it's worth $800000 to you. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $1500000. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
