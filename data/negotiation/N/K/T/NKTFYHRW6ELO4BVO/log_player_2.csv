The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking $13,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down to a price closer to Bob's limit."
