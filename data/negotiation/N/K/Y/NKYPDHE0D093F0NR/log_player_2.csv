# Alice's message: Bob, we're making progress, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my asking. How about $1,125,000? It's a fair price that considers your needs while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal now.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly coming down on her price, she's unlikely to reach a point significantly below $1,100,000. It's clear she's aiming for a price that gives her a substantial profit. At this point, it's more beneficial to cut our losses and buy from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees the best possible price and avoids further negotiation rounds that may not yield significant savings."
