"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $800,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,250,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
