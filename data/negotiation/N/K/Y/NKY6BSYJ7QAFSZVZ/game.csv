"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I believe it's worth $1500000, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1400000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $1400000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $1250000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This price is still a great value for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
