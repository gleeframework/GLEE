"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You can get the product for a lower price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
