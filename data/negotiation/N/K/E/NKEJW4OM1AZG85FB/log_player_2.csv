"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still above his desired price point, and he has room to negotiate.  He should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's meet halfway, and we can close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still a bit too high. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still out of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,000 is getting closer to his target, he can still likely get a better deal with continued negotiation.  He's also getting close to the point where he could go with John's offer and avoid further negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best we can do.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and accept $10,000. This price allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where further negotiation might be fruitless. Alice is holding firm on $10,000, and while Bob can try another counteroffer, it's possible this will lead to a stalemate. 

Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $8,000, it's the most sensible move at this point.  It's likely Bob can't get any lower than $9,500 from Alice, so buying from John provides a certain deal without further risk."
