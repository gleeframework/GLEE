Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a high initial offer allows room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to your minimum price of $150.  Even if Bob rejects this initial high price, it gives you a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $150. You have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This approach can be perceived as fair and may make Bob more receptive. 
* **Still above your minimum:**  $170 is still a good profit margin for you, exceeding your minimum price of $150. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While closer to your minimum, this counteroffer still leaves some space for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $140 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $150. While you could potentially negotiate for a bit more, accepting this offer guarantees you a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away from the deal entirely."
