"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $775,000? This is a fair deal that allows me to acquire the product while acknowledging its value.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. My final offer is $800,000. If this works for you, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I think I've already compromised enough. I'm willing to make one more offer: $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,7,
