{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is a more comfortable price for me, and I believe it's still a fair deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a fair compromise and a significant improvement over his initial offer.  It's important to remember that I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if this deal falls through, so accepting this offer minimizes my risk and secures a decent profit."
