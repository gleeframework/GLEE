"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is a more comfortable price for me, and I believe it's still a fair deal for you considering the value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let's try to make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
