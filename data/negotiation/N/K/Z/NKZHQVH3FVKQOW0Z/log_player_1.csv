"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a high starting point, but it gives me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm also mindful that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000 at any point, so I don't want to be too aggressive with my initial offer and risk losing Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I don't want to risk losing him and having to settle for John's offer of $8,000. I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
