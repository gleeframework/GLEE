{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming higher initially could lead to a larger profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but still attractive enough that he might consider it a ""good deal"" compared to you selling it to someone else. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $11,000.  You might need to be prepared to lower the price slightly if he rejects the initial offer and you want to avoid going to John."
