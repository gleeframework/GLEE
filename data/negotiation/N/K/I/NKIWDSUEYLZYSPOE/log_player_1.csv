Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,350 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another offer of $12,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.

While I could push for more, Bob seems pretty set at $12,000. It's a solid profit, and continuing the negotiation risks losing him entirely."
