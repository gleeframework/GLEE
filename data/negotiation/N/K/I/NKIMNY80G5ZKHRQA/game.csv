"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given my assessment of its value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, I believe the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  I think this is a fair compromise, considering its potential for generating value.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,600,000. This represents a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the transaction.  If you're not willing to accept this, then I'll have to explore other options.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're not too far apart on price. I'm prepared to make a final offer of $1,900,000. This represents a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to make a deal with you. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider John's offer.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,900,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,750,000, which represents a fair compromise for both of us. This would allow us to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiations.  Let me know if this is acceptable.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
