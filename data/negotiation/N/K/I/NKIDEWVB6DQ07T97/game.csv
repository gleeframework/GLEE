"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value is $1,200,000 to me. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While it's a great price, I'm looking to stay under $800,000 for this purchase.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get closer to the true value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
