Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, which is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  Using a positive and friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message explicitly indicates willingness to negotiate, which makes Bob more likely to counteroffer instead of simply rejecting. 

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of securing a price closer to my minimum value ($150) while also leaving some space for negotiation to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob rejected my initial offer, he is clearly interested in the product. There's still a chance I can negotiate a higher price with him.
* **John is a backup option:**  I have the option to sell to John for $150, which guarantees my minimum value. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore the possibility of reaching a mutually acceptable price with Bob while still having John as a secure fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $130 to $120. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the good deal I'm offering at $120. This reinforces the idea that he's getting a bargain.
* **Direct question:**  The message ends with a direct question, prompting Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving.

By offering a slightly lower price and emphasizing the value of the product, I'm aiming to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal while still securing a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $90 would be a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is still significantly below my minimum value of $150.  I'm not willing to lose that much money.
* **Negotiation is stalling:** Bob has already rejected two of my offers, and this latest offer shows he's unwilling to move much higher. Further negotiation is likely to be unproductive.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which has proven to be difficult. 

While I'd prefer to sell at a higher price, the time and energy required to negotiate further with Bob, who seems unwilling to budge much, outweigh the potential gain. Selling to John ensures a secure profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
