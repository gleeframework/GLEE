"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is $1,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a significant reduction, showing Bob's seriousness about getting a better deal. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good price for Bob. While he could continue negotiating and try to get an even lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers or that Bob will run out of rounds before reaching a deal. Accepting at this point is a good compromise, saving Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John."
