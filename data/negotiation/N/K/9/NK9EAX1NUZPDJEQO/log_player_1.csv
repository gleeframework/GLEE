Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since the product is worth $10,000 to both you and Bob, there's room for negotiation. Starting with a higher price, like $15,000, allows you to potentially earn a significant profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer gives you space to negotiate downwards if Bob hesitates.  
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000 gives you leverage. You don't *have* to accept an offer below that. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and any counter-offers he might make."
