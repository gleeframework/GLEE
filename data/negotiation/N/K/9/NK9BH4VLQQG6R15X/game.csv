"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $12,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $15,000. How about we try $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
