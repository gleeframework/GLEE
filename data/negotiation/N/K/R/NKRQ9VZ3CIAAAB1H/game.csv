"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value our potential partnership,  $1,050,000 is significantly lower than the product's true worth and the initial offer I made. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,150,000. This represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest proposal, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still need to stay within my budget. I am willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product, which I believe strikes a good balance between our interests.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
