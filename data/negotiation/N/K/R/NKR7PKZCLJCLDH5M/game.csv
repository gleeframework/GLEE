"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it.  How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the unique capabilities and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to reach a deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  To be honest, I'm considering another option closer to $1,000,000. If you're able to get closer to that range, I'm very interested, otherwise, I might have to go with my other option.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I'm confident that nothing compares to the value and potential of this product.  To show my commitment to making this work, let's settle this right now at $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair considering the unique benefits this product brings.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
