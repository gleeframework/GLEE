"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It makes sense to reject and negotiate downwards, keeping in mind you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it.  How about $800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly below Alice's asking price to establish a strong negotiating position. This leaves room for us to gradually increase our offer if needed.
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $800,000, we're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range.
* **John as Leverage:**  We always have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, giving us leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the unique capabilities and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice made a significant concession, the offer is still far above your $1,000,000 limit. It's time to push for a lower price or consider John's offer more seriously as the rounds progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  To be honest, I'm considering another option closer to $1,000,000. If you're able to get closer to that range, I'm very interested, otherwise, I might have to go with my other option."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Raising the Stakes:** We're now introducing a sense of urgency by mentioning another offer and being explicit about our budget limit.
* **Final Offer (almost):** While not explicitly stating it's our final offer,  we're strongly hinting that $1,000,000 is our limit. 
* **Leaving a Small Margin:** We're sticking to our $1,000,000 limit, leaving little to no room for further negotiation on our end, but potentially giving Alice a small margin to accept or counter with a price very close to our limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, but I'm confident that nothing compares to the value and potential of this product.  To show my commitment to making this work, let's settle this right now at $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair considering the unique benefits this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.
* **Too High:**  Even with her concession, the price of $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than your $1,000,000 limit and there's no indication that she'll go lower.
* **John's Deal:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take the guaranteed savings with John's offer."
