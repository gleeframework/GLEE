"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $12,000 is out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,500. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
