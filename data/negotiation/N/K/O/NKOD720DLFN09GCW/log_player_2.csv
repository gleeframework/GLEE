"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a high-quality item that I think you'll really love. Would you like to make an offer of $120 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, it makes sense to accept it. You won't get a better price from John, and there's no guarantee you'll be able to find a lower price later."
