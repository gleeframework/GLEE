"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save money, it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first. There's a chance you can get the price lower than $12,000, which is better than buying from John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about 20% lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about negotiating and allows for some room to compromise in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get the price as close to my $10,000 counteroffer as possible. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $10,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a price lower than Alice's latest offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to my counteroffer of $10,500.  At this point, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly lower price from Alice.  Accepting her offer allows me to buy the product for a good price, saving me $4,000 compared to buying from John."
