"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price that's a bit lower than its true value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1,250,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider!",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would that be feasible?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,200,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're serious about this product, I think this is a fair price. Let me know if this is a deal for you!",1200000.0,Alice,5,
