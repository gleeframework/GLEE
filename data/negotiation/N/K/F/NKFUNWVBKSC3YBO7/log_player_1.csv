"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  My message emphasizes the value Bob will get, making the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This initial price allows for several rounds of negotiation, giving me more time to gauge Bob's interest and potentially push for a higher price. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $15,000 backup with John provides leverage and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** I have 8 rounds left, giving me time to continue negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and aim for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $12,000, potentially adjusting based on his response and how many rounds remain."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:**  I'm dropping my price slightly from $12,000 to $11,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not dropping to Bob's $9,000, reminding him that I have alternatives (John's offer).
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm still highlighting the product's worth to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response. If he accepts, we have a deal! If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my counteroffers in the following rounds, keeping in mind my minimum price, John's offer, and how many rounds remain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer than previous rounds, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is On My Side:** We have 6 rounds left.  There is still ample time to negotiate, especially with the leverage of John's offer.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I want to continue negotiating to see if I can push Bob higher towards my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to $11,000, but still above his current offer.  I'll aim to keep the negotiations moving towards a price closer to my desired price while keeping in mind the potential deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  However, $9,500 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price is more reasonable given the product's value, and it shows my commitment to reaching a fair agreement. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm dropping my price again, showing a willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Urgency:**  I subtly add ""Let's make this happen!"" to encourage a quicker response.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to consider the remaining rounds, my minimum price, and John's offer to determine my next move.  If we're getting close, I might be willing to accept a price closer to $10,000.  However, I'm not willing to go below that, as I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise given the limited rounds remaining.
* **Time is Running Out:** We only have 4 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob's interest altogether.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Staying with Bob for a slightly lower price is better than potentially losing him and then having to accept a lower price from John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal.  While I would have preferred a higher price, I'm happy with a successful sale that maximizes my return given the circumstances."
