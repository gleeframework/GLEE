"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a strong opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant discount from her perceived value, it's still considerably higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at a much lower price."
