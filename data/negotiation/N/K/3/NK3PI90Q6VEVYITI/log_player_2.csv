Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my budget. I want to see if I can get her down further. While I could buy from John at $10,000, I'm hoping to save even more by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offers are getting more expensive, and I'm running out of time. While I'd still prefer to save even more by negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is too high. Buying from John at $10,000 is the safest option and within my budget."
