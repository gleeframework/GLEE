"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
