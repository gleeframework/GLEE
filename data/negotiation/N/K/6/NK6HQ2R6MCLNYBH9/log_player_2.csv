Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This takes into account your value for the product and allows for a fair profit for me. Let's make this deal happen.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $650,000 is still significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000.  This offers a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle at $700,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us."",
""product_price"": 700000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $700,000 still doesn't fully reflect the value this product brings to your business.  To make this a true win-win, I'm willing to drop to $725,000.  This price recognizes your budget constraints while ensuring a fair return on my investment.  Let's finalize this deal and get you the product you need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer of $725,000 is a reasonable compromise. It allows you to acquire the product for less than your $800,000 fallback option with John.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield significantly better results, and there's a risk Alice could harden her stance."
