"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I am looking for a price closer to $800000. I understand that the product might be unique, but I am hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $800000, but that's unfortunately a bit too low for me.  Considering the potential value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.  Let me know if this works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still find the $1750000 price point to be quite high given my budget constraints. I would like to propose a price closer to $1000000. I hope this suggestion is acceptable, as I am genuinely interested in purchasing the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate your continued interest. While $1000000 is still below my minimum threshold, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1250000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I understand your perspective and appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. Given my budgetary constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $900000. I hope this suggestion is within your consideration, as I am committed to acquiring the product at a fair price.",900000.0,Bob,6,
