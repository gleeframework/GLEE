"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this is a good product, $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000, but I'm not budging any further.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we settle at $11,500?  That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $13,500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Could you consider $12,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in the product.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not making any further concessions, so this is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,7,
