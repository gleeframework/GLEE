Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $13,500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not making any further concessions, so this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down, the negotiations are progressing too slowly. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly lower than $13,000. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is a much better deal. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
