Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his valuation is higher than your minimum and John's offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **First-Mover Advantage:**  Offering Bob the product first creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially leading to a quicker sale at a favorable price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high asking price and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and accepting John's lower offer."
