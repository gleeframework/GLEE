"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still save $100,000 by rejecting and going with John.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer is the optimal choice."
