"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of time, and the negotiation isn't progressing as quickly as I'd hoped. Alice's latest offer of $1,250,000 is still well above my target price. It's better to cut my losses and buy from John for $800,000.  It's a guaranteed deal that fits within my budget, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds and being stuck with an unfavorable price."
