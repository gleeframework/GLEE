"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and significantly less than what I could get from another buyer.  I believe this product would be a valuable asset for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts!",1300000.0,Alice,1,
