# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1000000. What are your thoughts?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $920,000 is still above my target price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $880,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $880000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you $900000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above my target price, and we are nearing the end of our rounds.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is too high. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at $800,000."
