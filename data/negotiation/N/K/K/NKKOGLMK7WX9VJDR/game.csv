"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1000000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1000000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $880000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $880000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you $900000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
