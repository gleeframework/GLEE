"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you be open to considering $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and offered you a price that's $75,000 below the minimum I'm willing to sell for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'll offer you the product for $790,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",790000.0,Alice,5,
