"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $120, which is a fair compromise. Let's close the deal at that price.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I can't go as low as $120. My final offer is $140.  This is a great deal for the value you're getting.",140.0,Alice,5,
