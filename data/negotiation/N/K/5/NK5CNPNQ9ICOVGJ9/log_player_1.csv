I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn a good profit.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer of $1,000,000 as my absolute floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price. While $1,000,000 is my floor, I can still do better by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while being more reasonable than my initial offer.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me and Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000 and still allows me to make a profit.  It's also likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price. So, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
