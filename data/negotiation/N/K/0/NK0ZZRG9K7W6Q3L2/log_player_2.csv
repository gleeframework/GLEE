(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting at her highest price, her product's worth to her.  While you're willing to pay that much, there's no benefit to accepting immediately.  By rejecting, you give her a chance to offer a lower price, potentially saving you money."
