"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While it's tempting to sell for $8,000, it's significantly less than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price, but it also gives him some wiggle room to negotiate.  I'm hopeful that this will start us on a path toward a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a compromise that is more beneficial for me.  I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to reduce my counteroffer to $11,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping that this offer will be more appealing to Bob and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob. I believe that I can get a better deal if I continue the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to make a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a smaller reduction from my previous offer, signaling that I'm getting closer to my bottom line. I'm hoping this will tempt Bob to finally close the deal, but I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  However, I'm running out of rounds. With only two rounds left, I need to be more strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is my final offer. It's just above Bob's last offer and closer to my bottom line than the last one.  If he rejects it, I'm prepared to sell to John for $12,000.  This is a high-risk strategy, but it's the only way to potentially get more than my minimum price."
