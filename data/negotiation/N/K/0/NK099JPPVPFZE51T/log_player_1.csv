Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm on a tight budget and $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": ""I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $10,500.""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
