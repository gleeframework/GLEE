"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's something truly special and I know you'll find it valuable. My initial price is $17,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $17,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's best to reject and counteroffer to start negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $14,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price for this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. Although buying from John for $15,000 is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Alice. It's worth exploring further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}
