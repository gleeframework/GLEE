"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $14,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price for this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
