"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's something truly special and I know you'll find it valuable. My initial price is $17,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't undervalue the product from the outset.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and positive, establishing a good rapport with Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates I'm open to discussion,  inviting Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $14,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price for this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:**  I'm responding to Bob's offer with a counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Moving Towards a Middle Ground:** My counteroffer of $16,000 is a compromise. It's lower than my initial price but still above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product while remaining open to negotiation. 
* **Urgency (subtle):**  The phrase ""Let's see if we can close this deal"" adds a touch of urgency to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Bob's offer of $15,500 is a good compromise. It's only $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I'm happy to accept a small profit.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out to John by continuing to haggle with Bob.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While there's always a chance I could get a higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of a counteroffer that's lower than John's price is too high.

I believe accepting Bob's offer is the most strategically sound decision at this stage."
