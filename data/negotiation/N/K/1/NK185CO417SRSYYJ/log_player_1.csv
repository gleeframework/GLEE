Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

I'm still doing better than my guaranteed sale with John, and Bob's counteroffer is a significant jump from his previous offer.  I'll try to nudge him a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I can do $780,000, but that's my absolute limit.

Bob is unlikely to go above $780,000, and I have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
