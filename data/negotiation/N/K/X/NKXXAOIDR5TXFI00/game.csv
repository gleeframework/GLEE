"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more around $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,050,000. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm prepared to accept $1,075,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,062,500. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can consider it.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
