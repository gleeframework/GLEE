{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. It's getting close to my limit, but I'm not willing to pay more than $80. I've already spent a few rounds trying to negotiate with Alice, and it seems like she's not willing to come down to my price. I'll just go ahead and buy the product from John for $80.  It's not the best price, but it's the best deal I can get right now."
