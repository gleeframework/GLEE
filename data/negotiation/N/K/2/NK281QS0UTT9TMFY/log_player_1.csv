Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I'm also aware that Bob has a lower valuation, so I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum desired price. I'm hoping to get closer to my value by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000, hoping to find a middle ground between our valuations while still securing a price that's above my minimum.  This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while remaining firm on a price that is still significantly more profitable than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum desired price. While I would prefer to secure a higher price, it's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my expectations.  To ensure I get a good return on my product, I'll accept John's offer and sell to him for $1,500,000."
