"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
