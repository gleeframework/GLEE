"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This leaves room for negotiation, but is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to settle yet.  Bob is clearly willing to pay more than my minimum, so I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and is significantly higher than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, but I'm not sure how much further I can push him. $105 is a decent price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn.  It's time to accept his offer."
