Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider an offer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll consider an offer of $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has consistently moved towards my desired price point. Accepting at $1,050,000 secures a significant discount from both her initial offer and John's price.  The potential savings from further negotiation are likely smaller than the risk of Alice hardening her stance."
