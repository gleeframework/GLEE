"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $1,050,000 is closer to his ideal price, he can potentially still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He's not yet at a point where buying from John is a better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to get closer to your price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. My next counteroffer is $1,020,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob has a few things to consider:

* **Alice's offer:** $1,020,000 is only $20,000 more than John's offer.
* **Negotiation time:**  This is round 5, and Bob has limited rounds left.
* **Risk:**  If Bob rejects, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. He risks losing out on a good deal.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy. While it's not his ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that saves him money compared to buying from John and ensures he gets the product."
