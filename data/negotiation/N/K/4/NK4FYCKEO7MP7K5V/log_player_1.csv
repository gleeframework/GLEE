Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.
