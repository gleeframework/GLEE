"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a good profit.  It's important to start high to establish a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I believe I can do better.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I want to see if he's serious about buying the product and willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for profit. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved slightly higher in his offer, and we're getting closer to a deal. Accepting his offer at $1,250,000 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum price and we've reached a point where further negotiation may be time-consuming.  It's important to close a deal when you're satisfied with the price."
