"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity. I have a unique product that I believe would greatly benefit you. After careful consideration, I've decided to offer it to you at a special price. For a limited time, you can acquire this valuable item for $12,000. This represents a significant savings compared to its true value and is an excellent chance for you to maximize your investment. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her stated value, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000.  You can try to negotiate a better price with Alice, but if she doesn't budge, John's offer will save you more."
