Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice (her minimum acceptable price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob (his maximum willingness to pay).
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice's best move is to offer the product to Bob for slightly less than $1,000,000.  Here's why:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Bob represents a profit opportunity above Alice's minimum price.
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to Bob immediately is preferable to waiting for the guaranteed sale to John. A slightly lower price for Bob might be offset by the speed of the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it at a special price of $995,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward about the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** It subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  The mention of a ""special price"" and ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Bob might counter-offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate slightly upward from $995,000 but remember that her guaranteed sale to John sets her bottom line."
