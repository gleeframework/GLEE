"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $125. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we settle on $110? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
