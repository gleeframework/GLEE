"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a minimum of $800,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to let it go for $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to part with such a valuable product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $850,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price reflects the product's value while also accommodating your needs.  I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle, $825,000 is still beyond my current budget. I would like to propose an offer of $775,000. I hope this revised offer is within your consideration range.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value your continued interest, $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $800,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll need to explore other options.  Let me know your decision.",800000.0,Alice,5,
