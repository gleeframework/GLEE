"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, I'm still a ways off from that number.  To be honest, my budget caps out at $11,000 for this.  If you're willing to work with that, I think we have a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. It's a bit above your budget, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I could potentially stretch to $11,250.  Do you think that might work?",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're interested, let me know, and we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
