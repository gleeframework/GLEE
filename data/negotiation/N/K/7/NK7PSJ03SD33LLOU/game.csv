"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $15,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your position, $15,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd like to go. Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm really keen on this product, and I'm willing to pay $16,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
