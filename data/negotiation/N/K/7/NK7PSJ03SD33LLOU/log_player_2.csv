"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $20,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and proceeding to counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $15,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your position, $15,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd like to go. Could you meet me halfway at $17,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $17,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it still exceeds his limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his goal of $15,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm really keen on this product, and I'm willing to pay $16,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
