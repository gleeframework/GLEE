"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $15,000 to you at a slightly discounted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to pay closer to $12,000. This product is worth $10,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I would like to counter your offer with a price of $13,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to its value to you, while ensuring a fair return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and also gives Alice a decent profit margin. Further negotiation could potentially get the price down a bit more, but the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
