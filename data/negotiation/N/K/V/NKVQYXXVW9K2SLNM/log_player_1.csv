Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility.  
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation."
