Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  There's a chance he values the product even more than we do.
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as reflecting the product's inherent worth, not just an arbitrary number.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have the security of John's offer, ensuring I won't go below my minimum. 

This strategy allows for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can always lower the price, aiming for somewhere between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000."
