"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you do $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  $12,000 is too low, but I'm willing to come down to $15,500. That's my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15,500 is still pushing my budget. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,6,
