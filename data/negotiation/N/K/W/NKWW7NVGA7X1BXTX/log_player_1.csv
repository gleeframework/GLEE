Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but still lower than my minimum acceptable value. This gives him some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.  I'm also considering John's offer of $15,000, which is my ideal price, but I want to see if I can get closer to it with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, and I'm not yet willing to sell to John for less than my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $13,500. This is a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also not willing to drop too much below my ideal price. I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still slightly below what I'd prefer. At this point, I'm concerned that further negotiation with Bob might take too much time, and I might not be able to reach a price that truly satisfies me.  Since John is offering my desired price of $15,000, I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
