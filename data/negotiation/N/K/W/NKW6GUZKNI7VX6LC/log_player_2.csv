"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Since you have a backup option with John for $15,000, it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she's willing to go lower, and you can save some money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $14000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think, Bob?

Alice has come down to $14,000, which is a good price considering you can get it from John for $15,000. It's worth accepting this offer to save $1,000."
