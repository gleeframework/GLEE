"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's something you'll really value, and I think it's worth $13,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. $13,000 is still too high for him, and he has room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $12,000?  It's a fair price that still allows me to get a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $12,000 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds left, and he may be able to get the product for closer to his $11,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping to get the product for $11,000.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's close this deal at $11,500. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's already gotten a good discount from the initial price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal. $11,500 is within his budget, and he gets the product for less than John's price."
