Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $900,000.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $875,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. I'm better off taking John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."
