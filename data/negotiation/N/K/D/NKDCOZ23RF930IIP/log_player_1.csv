{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
Bob is unwilling to budge on his price and I've already made several concessions.  Given the time constraint and my minimum value for the product, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than risking further negotiation and ending up with less."
