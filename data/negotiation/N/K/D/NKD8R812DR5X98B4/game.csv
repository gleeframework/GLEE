"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really value. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $90?  That's still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting a product worth $100 to you for less. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
