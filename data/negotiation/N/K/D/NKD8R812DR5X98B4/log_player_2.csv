"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really value. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for a lower price than from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $90?  That's still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting a product worth $100 to you for less. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still aiming to get the product for less than $90.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you a chance to get a better price."
