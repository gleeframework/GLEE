I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $80, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to pique Bob's interest with a friendly message."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. I think I can pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $100.  I believe I can get a better deal with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I'm looking for a bit more for this product. How about $95? It's still a good deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I believe I can pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still think there's room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to $95 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about $92?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience, Alice. I think I can pay $91 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $91. While it's still a little lower than my ideal price, I'm worried that continuing to negotiate could result in Bob walking away entirely. At this point, it's a good deal and a better outcome than selling to John for $80."
