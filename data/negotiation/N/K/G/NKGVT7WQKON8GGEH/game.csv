"Hi Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a significant reduction and I hope it demonstrates my willingness to find a compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and my budget. I hope you'll consider this offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I appreciate you moving up, I'm still looking for a price closer to my original ask. Would you be willing to consider $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $14,000 is still too far from what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. If you're serious about selling, I hope you'll consider this as a final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
