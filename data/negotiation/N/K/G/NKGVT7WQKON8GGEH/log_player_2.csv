"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a significant reduction and I hope it demonstrates my willingness to find a compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $17,000 is better than her initial offer, it is still above his budget.  He should continue to negotiate, aiming to get closer to his $8,000 target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $14,000 is lower than her previous offers, it's still above his budget. He should continue to negotiate, trying to get closer to his $8,000 target or potentially consider buying from John if he believes further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to be successful."
