"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a decent price, it's still far from your ideal price. You can potentially save more by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. It's a bold move, but it signals your serious intent to purchase the product at a lower price. It also leaves room for negotiation, as you are still willing to pay a price above Alice's minimum value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to your target, it's still not the best price. You can likely negotiate a lower price by making another counteroffer. It's always worth exploring your options before committing to a price that's still higher than what you're aiming for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

You're increasing your offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below Alice's current offer. This shows you're serious about buying, but you're also not willing to overpay. This counteroffer is a good middle ground and could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $820,000 is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than what he would pay from John ($1,500,000). It's also within Bob's budget and allows him to acquire the product at a favorable price. 

While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another offer and ultimately needing to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential gains from continuing negotiations. It's better to secure this good deal before the opportunity passes."
