"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This price still offers you a substantial value, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer secures a sale and ensures I don't lose out on the potential deal with John. While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision at this point."
