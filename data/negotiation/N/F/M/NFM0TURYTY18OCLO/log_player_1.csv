Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price that leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I make more than my minimum of $80.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and potentially make a new one.  However, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $80 if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it immediately. Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering Bob $85 for the product. This is a compromise, acknowledging his low offer but still allowing me to make a profit. It's likely he'll accept this as a fair price, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $79 is below my minimum.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him at this point, as I risk getting stuck with a price lower than John's offer. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $80."
