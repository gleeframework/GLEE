,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $7500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $8000. That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to close the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
