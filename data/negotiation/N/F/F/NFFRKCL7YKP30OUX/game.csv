"Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find its value exceeds the price.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1200000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1350000.  This offer is a fair compromise and allows us to both benefit from this transaction.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
