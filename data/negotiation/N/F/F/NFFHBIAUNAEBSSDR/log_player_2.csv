"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It leaves a lot of room for negotiation. I'll try to get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for us to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $5,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down significantly, $9,000 is still above my target price. I believe there's room for further negotiation before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move towards her price, but I'm still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $6,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,500, which is a significant discount from my original offer. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is holding firm at $8,500, and even though she states it as her final offer, it's unlikely she'll go much lower.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
