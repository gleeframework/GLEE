"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects a compromise from my initial offer and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can close this agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
