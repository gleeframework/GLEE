Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob values the product and that she has a guaranteed sale at $15,000. Starting with a high offer of $20,000 allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" Alice encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid missing out on what she's presenting as a good deal.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at its worth, potentially justifying the high price in his mind.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer outright. However, Alice's strategy is based on maximizing potential profit given the information available."
