I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This price is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a little extra for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm counteroffering Bob at $9,500. This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not a good deal for me considering the time and effort spent negotiating. John offers a much better price, and I'm confident that this is the best decision for me at this point."
