"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to establish a starting point that allows for potential concessions while still ensuring I maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it's still well above Bob's offer and close to my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to secure a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price that satisfies both of us. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing continued flexibility, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. This should keep the negotiation moving forward and hopefully push Bob closer to a more favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for a price that leaves me with a profit of just $100,000. I'll reject his offer and try to push him further with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,450,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's last offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value. With only a few rounds left, I need to start closing the gap, but I'm not willing to settle for less than a $50,000 profit. This offer should be a strong incentive for Bob to accept the deal."
