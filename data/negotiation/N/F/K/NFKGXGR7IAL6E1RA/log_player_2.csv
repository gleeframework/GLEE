Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a very low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and might encourage her to consider a more reasonable price.  I'm hoping to reach a middle ground that is favorable to me without jeopardizing the deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above my preferred price point, but it's getting closer.  I'm hoping to negotiate a lower price, ideally closer to John's offer. I still have a few rounds left, and it's worth trying to get a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and attempt to counter with a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is now within my budget and is only $50,000 more than John's price. I'm not sure if I can get a lower price, and I only have 3 rounds left. Accepting this offer saves me some time and still allows me to acquire the product."
