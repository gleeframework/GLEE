"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is your budget, but I have to consider the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering its worth to you is $8,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original offer. However, I still need to earn a profit. I'm willing to consider $8,500, which is a compromise between my original price and your latest offer. This is the best I can do at this point.",8500.0,Alice,5,
