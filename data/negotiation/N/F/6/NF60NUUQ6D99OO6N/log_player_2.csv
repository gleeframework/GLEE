Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is your budget, but I have to consider the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering its worth to you is $8,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original offer. However, I still need to earn a profit. I'm willing to consider $8,500, which is a compromise between my original price and your latest offer. This is the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees you get the product at your target price."
