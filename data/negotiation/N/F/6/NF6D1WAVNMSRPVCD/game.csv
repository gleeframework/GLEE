"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,600,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll be gaining.  What do you think?",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,950,000. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway at $1,700,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand where you're coming from on the price, and to meet you closer, I'm willing to accept $1,825,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  Do we have an agreement?",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product, but I'd like to propose a deal where I'll also agree to a 3-year maintenance contract worth $50,000 per year. I think this will not only benefit you but also ensure the product runs smoothly for me. What do you think?",1700000.0,Bob,6,
