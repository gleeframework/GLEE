{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,950,000. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway at $1,700,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to meet her halfway again, but I think I can get a better deal.
