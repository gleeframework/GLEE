""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,600,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll be gaining.  What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,950,000. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway at $1,700,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. We are still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth pushing for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand where you're coming from on the price, and to meet you closer, I'm willing to accept $1,825,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  Do we have an agreement?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product, but I'd like to propose a deal where I'll also agree to a 3-year maintenance contract worth $50,000 per year. I think this will not only benefit you but also ensure the product runs smoothly for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob didn't increase his offer on the product itself, the added value of the 3-year maintenance contract brings the total deal value to $1,850,000. This is a significant amount over John's offer and a reasonable compromise.  Accepting now secures a favorable outcome for both parties."
