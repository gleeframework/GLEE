""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values it at $12,000 gives Alice room to negotiate above that price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000, so she shouldn't go below that.

**The offer of $14,500:**

* **Appealing to Bob:** It's a substantial discount from Alice's minimum, potentially enticing to Bob.
* **Strong Profit for Alice:** If Bob accepts, Alice gets a great deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob counters, there's space for Alice to slightly decrease and still stay above her minimum."
