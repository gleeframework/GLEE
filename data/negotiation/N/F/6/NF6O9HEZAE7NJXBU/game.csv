"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10800. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $10800. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11200, which is still a great price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11200 is a good price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10900. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10900 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle this at $11050. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",11050.0,Alice,5,
