"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $12,000. This means there's room for negotiation. Bob has a maximum budget of $15,000 and can get the product from John for that price. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice.  By offering $10,500, Bob is offering a price that's significantly closer to Alice's value but still leaves some room for negotiation. This also leaves a buffer before needing to buy from John for $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer and still higher than what Bob is willing to pay from John.  It's better to continue negotiating and potentially try to lower the price further. There are still several rounds remaining to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but staying below Alice's last offer. This shows that he's willing to negotiate but not willing to pay an unreasonable price. He is still leaving room for a potential agreement within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he would pay to John.  It's important for Bob to keep negotiating to try to get the price down further. There are still several rounds remaining, and with persistence, he might be able to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting close to his budget. He's increasing his offer again, showing that he's serious about buying the product. However, he is still leaving a little room for Alice to come down in price.  It's important to keep negotiating as the rounds are getting limited, and Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although the time is getting tight, Bob is still better off rejecting Alice's offer.  It's only $1500 away from his maximum budget, but Bob should try to negotiate further. There are still 3 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a significant increase in his offer. This is a strong signal to Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's still pushing for a lower price. With only three rounds left, this is likely his last chance to make a counteroffer before having to choose between Alice's next offer or buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, it's a better strategy for Bob to buy the product from John. Alice is offering a price that is only $1,000 less than John's price, and there is only one round left for negotiations. There's a high chance that Alice will reject Bob's final counteroffer, leaving him with no product at all.  It's better to secure the product from John now, even if it means paying slightly more."
