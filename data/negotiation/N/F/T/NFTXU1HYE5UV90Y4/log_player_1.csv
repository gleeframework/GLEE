Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think the price is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  There's room for him to come up higher, and I'm willing to dedicate a few more rounds to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my target range. I'll push a little further."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,220,000 for the product. I think it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to be realistic.  Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and while I'd prefer to get to $1,300,000, securing a $220,000 profit is a good outcome.  It's better to accept now than risk him lowering his offer or walking away in later rounds."
