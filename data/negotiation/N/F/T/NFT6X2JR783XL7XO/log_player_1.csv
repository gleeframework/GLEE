Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This would give us both a good deal, with me getting the product and you getting a fair price. Let's see if we can make this work.
