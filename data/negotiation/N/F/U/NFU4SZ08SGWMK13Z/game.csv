"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What would you say?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $11,000? I think that's a fair offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to let it go for $14,500.  I need to get at least this much for it to make it worth my while. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I can see this is important to you, but $14,500 is still a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $11,500? That's the highest I can go.",11500.0,Bob,6,
