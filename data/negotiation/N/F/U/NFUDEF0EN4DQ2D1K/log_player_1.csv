"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential concessions in later rounds."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I believe there's room for more negotiation and I'm not yet ready to sell to John for a lower price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}

I'm making a small counteroffer at $1,275,000. This demonstrates my willingness to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still trying to secure a price closer to my desired value."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I still believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob.  If he rejects this offer, I will be forced to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm running out of time and there is a significant risk Bob will reject any further counteroffers. It's safer to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk getting nothing."
