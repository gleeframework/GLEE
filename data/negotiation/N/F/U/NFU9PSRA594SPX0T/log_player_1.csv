"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to set the bar high early on.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming for a price well above my minimum. 

If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate downward, but the initial high offer establishes my expectations and leaves room for concessions.  

Remember, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to leverage the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000 as a bargaining chip.  I will use this leverage to try and get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $2,000,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000. 

This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider my options more carefully. I'm still willing to go lower, but I'll keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as I weigh my choices."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his initial offer of $1,200,000, which is still far below my minimum. While tempting, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safer option than settling for a price so low.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will continue negotiating with him, using John's offer as leverage.  There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,600,000.  While this is still above my minimum acceptable price, it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  

With each round, I'm narrowing the gap between my offer and Bob's, aiming for a mutually acceptable agreement.  I believe this offer is a good compromise considering the potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still too low.  I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob.  John's offer of $1,500,000 is a safety net, but I'm still hopeful that I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to take a more aggressive approach this round. I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,550,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

I'm doing this for two reasons:

1. **Time is running out:** We're down to 3 rounds left. I need to start closing the gap between my offer and Bob's if I want to make a deal with him.
2. **John's offer is a powerful incentive:** I know I can sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm using that knowledge to push Bob closer to my desired price.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to make a final counteroffer in the next round, aiming to hit my minimum acceptable price. I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We are down to two rounds left, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet me halfway.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of not getting a deal at all is too high.

Given these circumstances, it's best to take the guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It's the most sensible choice to ensure I receive a price that meets my minimum requirements."
