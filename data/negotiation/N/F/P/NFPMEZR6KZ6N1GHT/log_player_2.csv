"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is $1,500,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget and the market value she claims, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer to avoid losing the sale."
