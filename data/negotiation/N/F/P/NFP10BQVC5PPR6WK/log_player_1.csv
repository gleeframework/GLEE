Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
