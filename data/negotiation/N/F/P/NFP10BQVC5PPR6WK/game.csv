"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
