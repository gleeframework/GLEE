# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is a decent price, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further in a subsequent offer."
