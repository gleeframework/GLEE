"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save money and the product is worth $150 to you, accepting Alice's offer of $160 is not a good choice. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John immediately for $150 is also not ideal, as there's a chance you could get the product for a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $140. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $160, but still within the range of what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $155 is closer to my target price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Buying from John at this point for $150 is still a good option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $145. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $140 and Alice's latest offer of $155. I believe this price is fair and shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still prioritize saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $152 is only $2 more than what I'm willing to pay from John.  Considering that we're already at round 5, and there are only 5 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating.  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price, and I might end up buying from John for $150 anyway. It's better to accept this offer and get the product now."
