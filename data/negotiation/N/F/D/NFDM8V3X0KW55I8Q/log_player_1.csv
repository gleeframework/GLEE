I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:** This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It shows confidence in my product's value:** A high opening price suggests I believe the product is worth a lot, which could influence Bob's perception. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for back-and-forth negotiation without immediately jeopardizing the deal.

I'll be watching Bob's response carefully. If he rejects the offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth pursuing further."
