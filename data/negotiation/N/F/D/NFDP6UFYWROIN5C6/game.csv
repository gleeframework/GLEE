"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, my initial price took into account several key factors that justify a higher valuation.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's potential.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $900,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your initial price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but the gap between our positions remains significant. This product holds substantial value beyond what you're currently offering. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,025,000, but that's my final offer. I believe it reflects the product's true worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my previous offers.",925000.0,Bob,6,
