"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $80? Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $90, which is a fair compromise considering my budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",90.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $120, so I'm counteroffering at $105. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it.",105.0,Alice,5,,
