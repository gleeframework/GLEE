"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but let's split the difference.  How about $1,300,000?  This is a fair price that still allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's aim for a final deal that works for both of us. How about $1,350,000?  This is a fair compromise that takes into account the value we both place on this product.  I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about $1,275,000? I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $1,275,000 simply isn't enough for me.  How about $1,325,000?  This offer takes into account both our positions and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about $1,300,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,8,
