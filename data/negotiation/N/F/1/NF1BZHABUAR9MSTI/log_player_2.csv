(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is too high of an initial offer.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be happy to offer $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I am proposing to offer the product to you for $10,500. I believe this price reflects both the value of the product and allows for a fair transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit high, and I'm hesitant to commit at this point.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to offer the product to you for $10,000. This price reflects the value of the product while also allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has finally come down to a price that's within my budget.  While I could technically get it for the same price from John, there's no point in switching sellers now.  I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
