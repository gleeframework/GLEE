"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something of immense value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. This product is quite interesting to me, but I believe a price closer to $1,200,000 would be more reasonable. Would you be open to negotiating in that range?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,250,000?  That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $1,250,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking $1,350,000 could be a sweet spot for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems we're getting closer.  I'm willing to move up slightly to $1,275,000.  Let's make this deal happen!",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,290,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
