Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,290,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's also sticking close to her starting point. At $1,290,000, you're getting a significant discount off her initial offer and a good price overall. Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly better deal, but there's also the risk of Alice becoming less flexible. It's a good idea to accept this offer now and secure a good price."
