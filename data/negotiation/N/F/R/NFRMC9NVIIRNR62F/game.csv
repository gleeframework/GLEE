"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I also have to consider the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,050,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,080,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
