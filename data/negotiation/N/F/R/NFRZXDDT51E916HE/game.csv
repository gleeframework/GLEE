"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer of $950,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe you'll be happy with the purchase.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe that the product's value is closer to $1,100,000. Considering your offer of $975,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe you'll be happy with the purchase.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm appreciative of your continued negotiation, but unfortunately, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.  We can close this deal now and avoid further back-and-forth, or I will need to explore other options, including purchasing from another seller.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
