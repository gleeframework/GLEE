"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $20,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to me.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price of $20,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $7,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, given the product's worth to you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I can do better than that. I'll offer $9,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your latest offer, Bob, but $9,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $16,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think I can do better than that. I'll offer $10,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,6,
