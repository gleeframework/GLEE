"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since you have a backup option with John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down. This leaves room for negotiation if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above my target. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting allows for another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer. This should keep the negotiation moving and hopefully lead to a more favorable final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and we're only $25,000 away from my initial counteroffer.  Accepting is the most logical choice, as the potential savings from further negotiation are small compared to the risk of her walking away and forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price."
