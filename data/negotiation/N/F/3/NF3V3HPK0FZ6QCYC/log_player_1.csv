Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum.  This allows for potential negotiation and gives me a good starting point.  I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate.  If not, I'll always have John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I need to be mindful of potential losses, selling for $800,000 would be a huge loss for me. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price. This allows for potential negotiation, but also ensures I won't lose out on the deal if Bob isn't willing to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to lose out on too much profit. Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
