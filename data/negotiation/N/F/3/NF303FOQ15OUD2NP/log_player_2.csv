Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm firm on at least $80 for this product. It's high quality and I know you'll get your money's worth.  Let's try $82.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's not the absolute lowest, getting the product for $82 meets my needs while still leaving some room for negotiation in case Alice is bluffing.  It's better to secure a reasonable price now than risk the deal falling through and having to pay John's higher price."
