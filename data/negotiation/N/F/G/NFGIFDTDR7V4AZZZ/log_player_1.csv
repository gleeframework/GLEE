"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it.  I'm starting with a price of $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm framing the initial offer as an opening point for discussion.  

I'm hoping this will start the negotiation process in a positive way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, I need to get a bit more for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I'm showing respect for Bob's offer, while still stating my own needs.
* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a compromise to meet halfway, which can be appealing in negotiations.
* **Open to Feedback:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, keeping the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $105. Can you meet me at $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $98 is still too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or, if necessary, I can still sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal. I'm willing to go down to $102, but that's really my bottom line.  Let's make this happen.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 102}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm stating my price point clearly, indicating I'm serious about a deal, but still open to negotiation.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to act.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm staying positive and optimistic to keep the conversation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $102. Can you meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We are now in Round 6, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that we'll run out of rounds without reaching a deal.  I've already been negotiating for a while and I don't want to waste any more time. It's best to accept the guaranteed $120 from John to ensure I get the best possible outcome."
