Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $120 to Bob. This is crucial information.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $119 (just below Bob's maximum), it might make him feel like he's not getting a good deal. Offering $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $80. This means you don't have to go below that price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate you down further. Be prepared to consider counter-offers, but remember your minimum acceptable price is $80."
