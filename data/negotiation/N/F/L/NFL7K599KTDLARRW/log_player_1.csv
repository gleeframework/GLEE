Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,999. This is a one-time offer, as I already have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer adds pressure for Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, giving you a little wiggle room. 
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $12,000 to Bob might make it seem like you're desperate to sell and don't have other options.

It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer knowing his perceived value is much lower. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
