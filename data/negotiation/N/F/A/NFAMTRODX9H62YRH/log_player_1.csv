"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  Given its unique advantages, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique advantages"" and appealing to Bob's ""business acumen,"" the message aims to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room:** The offer is significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum, allowing for concessions throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not quite justified by the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer meets your absolute minimum price, you have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount. There's no strategic advantage to continuing negotiations with Bob at this point. Selling to John ensures you receive your desired value without the risk of further negotiation potentially lowering the final price."
