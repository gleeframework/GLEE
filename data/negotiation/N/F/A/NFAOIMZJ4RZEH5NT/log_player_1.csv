Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price of $150, but not so high that it's likely to immediately scare Bob away. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's a reasonable compromise. Accepting his offer is the best option to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
