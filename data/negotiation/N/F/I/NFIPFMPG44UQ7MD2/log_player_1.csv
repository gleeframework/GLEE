Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a high offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer of $19,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $10,000. While it might seem high, it gives you leverage to potentially negotiate down while still making a profit above your minimum. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value, potentially swaying Bob's perception.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics. If you know he's a hard bargainer, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is crucial, you might want to start with a less aggressive offer, even if it means potentially earning slightly less."
