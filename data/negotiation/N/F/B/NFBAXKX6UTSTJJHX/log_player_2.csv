"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than your target. This shows that you're serious about buying the product but also that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right. It leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gets Alice closer to your desired price without being so low that she immediately rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above your desired $800,000. There's still room for negotiation to bring the price down further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to continue trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your target but lower than Alice's last offer. This demonstrates your willingness to meet halfway while still pushing for a better price. It also avoids pushing Alice to accept John's offer."
