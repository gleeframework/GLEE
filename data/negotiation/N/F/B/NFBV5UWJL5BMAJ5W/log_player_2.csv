"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $110, I'm anchoring the negotiation closer to my target price. Even if Alice rejects it, it sets the stage for future offers.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is framed positively, expressing interest while also explaining my budget constraints.  This makes it more likely Alice will continue negotiating.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm leaving room to negotiate upwards while staying below my maximum budget of $150 and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I can do $130, but I was thinking more along the lines of $135. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have some wiggle room.  She's signaling some flexibility by mentioning $130. I'll reject this offer to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle in the middle at $122?"",
""product_price"": 122
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a compromise at $122, directly between my previous offer ($110) and her current one ($135). This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Close to Target:** This price is very close to Alice's value ($120) and well below my maximum budget. There's a good chance she'll accept, and it's a good deal for me. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm still prepared to walk away if needed and buy from John for $150, but this offer aims for a more beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Savings:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is likely firm on a price close to $125.  The potential savings from another round of negotiation are minimal. 
* **Good Deal:** $125 is still a very good price compared to my maximum budget of $150 and John's offer. It's a reasonable compromise.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield significant gains and could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a good price."
