"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it, given that's the maximum I'm willing to spend.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit too high.  I can go up to $9,000. Let's see if we can close this deal. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
