"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 right now. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. Let me know if that works for you!",13500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a little too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to purchase the product within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I want to keep the negotiation going. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this works for you!",14000.0,Alice,5,,
