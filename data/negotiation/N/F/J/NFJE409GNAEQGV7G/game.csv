"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is still very attractive for you considering the product's value, and it's the lowest I can go.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This leaves us both with a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,5,
