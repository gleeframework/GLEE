"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I believe would be a great asset to your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's well below its true value, but still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's discuss a price of $12,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000). While it's lower than your maximum budget and John's offer, there's room for negotiation to get a better price."
