"Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I believe would be a great asset to your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's well below its true value, but still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's discuss a price of $12,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
