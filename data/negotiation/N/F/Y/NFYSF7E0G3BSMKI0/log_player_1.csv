I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but I want to leave room for negotiation and see how much Bob is willing to pay."

While I'm happy with $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,350,000. This is still a good price for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer and shows that I'm willing to compromise."
