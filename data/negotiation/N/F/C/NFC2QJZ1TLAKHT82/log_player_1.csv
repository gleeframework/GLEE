Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you're free to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if listed publicly, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is $5,000 above your minimum, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a sale above your baseline."
