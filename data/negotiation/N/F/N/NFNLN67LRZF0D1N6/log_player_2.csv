"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum value, there's room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your price is attractive, I'm hoping to secure a better deal.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. This price is still within my budget and provides a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than your initial maximum of $1,000,000 and still provides a decent profit for Alice.  Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but it risks Alice walking away or you running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures a successful deal and saves you a substantial amount of money."
