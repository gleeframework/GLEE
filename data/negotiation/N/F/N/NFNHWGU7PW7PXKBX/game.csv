"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. This product definitely seems interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find this offer more reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I hope you can understand my position.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
