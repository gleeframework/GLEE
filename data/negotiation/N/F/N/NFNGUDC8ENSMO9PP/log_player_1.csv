"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to encourage negotiation but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and highlights the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price is lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without me losing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1050000. This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for us both to profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still far below the $1,200,000 I need to make this deal worthwhile.
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price.  
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** While I want to sell to Bob if possible, selling to John guarantees my minimum desired profit. 

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point. I'll aim to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000,  which is still a fair price considering the value this product brings you.  Let's keep the negotiation moving - what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Strategic compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This shows a desire to reach an agreement while maintaining my profitability.
* **Positive and engaging tone:**  The message encourages Bob to continue the negotiation and emphasizes the value he'll gain from the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $1075000 is a fair price that acknowledges both our perspectives.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While he's moved closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal.
* **The risk of selling to John is low:** I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I don't need to rush into a decision.

**Next steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob again, aiming to get closer to my desired price point.  I'll need to be more aggressive and potentially offer a smaller concession to encourage a quicker agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me.  I'm feeling  $1,125,000 is a much fairer price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's close the deal at this point, it's a win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm only increasing my offer by $25,000, showing a willingness to compromise but still holding firm. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll receive from the product, justifying my price.
* **Sense of urgency:**  I'm suggesting we finalize the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Win-win frame:**  I'm framing the offer as a win for both parties to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's try to find a solution that benefits us both.  I'm firm at $1075000. It's a good price for you, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to 4 rounds, and I haven't been able to convince Bob to move up significantly.
* **No significant progress:**  Bob is sticking to his price, and I'm not sure I can push him higher in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired profit of $1,200,000.

It's a strategic decision. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the risk of not closing a deal in the remaining rounds is too high.  Selling to John secures a favorable outcome for me, even though it's not my ideal scenario."
