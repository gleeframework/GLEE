"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John is always an option if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for us both to profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1050000 doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000,  which is still a fair price considering the value this product brings you.  Let's keep the negotiation moving - what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to negotiate. Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price, and Bob can likely secure a price closer to his target of $1,050,000.  Buying from John is always a fallback option, but there's still room for improvement in the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $1075,000 is a fair price that acknowledges both our perspectives.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1075000 is still too low for me.  I'm feeling  $1125000 is a much fairer price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's close the deal at this point, it's a win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is coming down in price, Bob should still reject the offer. He's still within his target price range of $1,050,000 - $1,075,000.  Continuing to negotiate could get him a better deal, and the option to buy from John always remains."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, let's try to find a solution that benefits us both.  I'm firm at $1,075,000. It's a good price for you, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
