"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $120 to both of us. I'm starting the negotiation at $105. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is a good deal, you can likely get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $95.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position. To move forward, I propose we set the product price at $100. This allows us to find common ground while still valuing the product appropriately. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to your desired price point, you can still potentially get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target. How about $97?  That seems like a fair compromise, given our starting points."", ""product_price"": 97}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a price of $98 for the product. It's a step towards meeting your target while still maintaining a fair value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $98, which is only $3 more than your target of $95.  Considering you have only 5 rounds left and you can get it for $120 from John, it's a good deal to accept.  There's a chance you could get it for $96 or $97 in the remaining rounds, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential small savings."
