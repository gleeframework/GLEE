Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the premium quality, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 10000}
