"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $12,000 to make this work.  Could we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $11,000.  I'm really close to accepting, but I need just a bit more to make it work.  How about $11,100? It's only a small increase, but it would make a big difference for me.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11100.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand your need to make a small increase, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",10900.0,Bob,8,
