{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can we meet in the middle at $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $15,000?  That's a significant discount, and I believe it's fair considering the value I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not comfortable with $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13500? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm getting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I want to see if I can get him to go up a bit more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000. That's a very fair price for the value I'm offering, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13500, so how about $13250? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly higher offer.  I'm not confident I can get him to agree to my counteroffer in the remaining rounds, and if I reject him, I risk having to sell to John for $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's time to accept and close the deal."
