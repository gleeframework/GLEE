"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can we meet in the middle at $14000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your interest.  While $12000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $15000?  That's a significant discount, and I believe it's fair considering the value I'm offering.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not comfortable with $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13500? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm getting.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $14000. That's a very fair price for the value I'm offering, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13500, so how about $13250? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment if we can agree on this price.",13250.0,Bob,6,
