Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a better deal if he pushes back a little. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies that the product is worth more than Bob might initially think.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  Alice knows she has John as a backup buyer at $150, so she can afford to be a bit bolder with her initial offer to Bob."
