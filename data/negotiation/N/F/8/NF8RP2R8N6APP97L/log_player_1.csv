Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" you subtly imply that the product is worth the asking price without explicitly stating Bob will get a bad deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know what you think"" encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue and potentially counter-offer.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you still have the security of selling to John for $12,000.  You can then decide whether to slightly lower the price for Bob or stand firm."
