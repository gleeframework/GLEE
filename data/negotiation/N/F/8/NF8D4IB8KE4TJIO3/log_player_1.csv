"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum, but still below what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefit for both of us, making it seem like a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, setting the stage for a potential back-and-forth. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round.  I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response, and I have the option of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob stalls or I feel I won't get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would mean a loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's initial counteroffer is too low, it opens the door for further negotiation. I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  I'm aware that selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, but I'm not ready to accept that just yet.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground. I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and the potential of selling to John if negotiations with Bob stall."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That way we both walk away with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($14,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($11,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and making the deal more palatable.
* **Remaining Flexible:** I'm still leaving room for negotiation if Bob doesn't accept this offer. 

**Important Note:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a backup option (John) if this round doesn't work out. My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to Bob while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $11,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting would mean a loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:** While Bob is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially with only 6 rounds left. 
* **John is a Safety Net:** I'm aware that selling to John is a safe option, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again, possibly meeting him halfway once more. I'll need to be strategic as the rounds are getting shorter, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can come down to $12,000.  This is really my bottom line, but I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This time, I'm offering a price exactly halfway between my previous offer ($12,500) and Bob's current offer ($11,500).  This demonstrates a genuine attempt to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Bottom Line:** I'm clearly stating that this is my lowest acceptable price, creating urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm ending the message with a hopeful tone, suggesting that we can reach a successful conclusion.

**Important Note:** 

* I'm still aware that selling to John for $12,000 is an option, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob at a slightly higher price.
* With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and firm in my negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and go to $11,750? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be realistic about the likelihood of getting a higher price from Bob.
* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $12,000 that John is willing to pay.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit, while continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of ending up with nothing.

**Conclusion:**

I've decided to sell the product to John.  It's a safe choice that ensures I meet my minimum goal.  While I would have liked to get a higher price, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob outweighs the potential reward."
