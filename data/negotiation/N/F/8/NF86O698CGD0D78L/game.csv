"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still gives you a good value, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I still need to make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that gives both of us a good deal. Let's find a solution.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
