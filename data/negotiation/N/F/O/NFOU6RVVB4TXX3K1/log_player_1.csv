Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still being attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $14,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit, while also being closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's last offer is too low, and I don't think there's much room for further negotiation. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's closer to my desired value, so it's the most sensible option."
