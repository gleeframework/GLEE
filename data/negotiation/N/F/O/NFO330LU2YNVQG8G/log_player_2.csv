"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from its true value. This is a limited-time opportunity, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is clearly using pressure tactics by mentioning another buyer.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to settle for a higher price."
