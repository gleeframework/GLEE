# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. Plus, I think you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a ""deal"" based on the product's value to Bob, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  Bob should reject Alice's offer and purchase from John for $8,000."
