"Thanks Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you. Let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $108. If we can agree on that price, I'm ready to buy.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 is still not quite there for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is a good price for both of us, and I don't want to miss this opportunity to work with you. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
