"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to both of us, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I appreciate your consideration.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  How about $1,180,000? This still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. ",1180000.0,Alice,3,
