Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm offering it to you before considering other buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I think you'll find this a worthwhile investment."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  A price of $1,900,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Value justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique opportunity"" and the product's value to encourage Bob to accept a price higher than your minimum.
* **Alternative buyer (implied):**  While not explicitly mentioning John, the phrase ""before considering other buyers"" subtly hints at the existence of other interested parties. This could motivate Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price."
