"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $122. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,5,
