Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his perceived value of the product is. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. However, I believe there is room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer, but still leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary.  I want to see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's unlikely he will offer more.  It's better to accept and secure the sale rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer."
