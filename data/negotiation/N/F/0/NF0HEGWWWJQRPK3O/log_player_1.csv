"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the significant value it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:**  The message is framed to encourage a positive negotiation process. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit, but I also understand Bob has alternatives. I'm aiming to reach an agreement above my minimum selling point ($800,000) within the 10 rounds. I'll carefully analyze Bob's counteroffers and adjust my strategy accordingly, always keeping in mind the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my initial ask and still leaves a substantial gap from his perceived value of $1,200,000. While it's above my minimum selling point to John, I believe there's room for negotiation to achieve a better outcome. 

**Strategy:**

I will counter with an offer closer to $1,000,000 in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle while still securing a significant profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer considering the true value this product holds. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've reduced my price by $50,000 from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a compromise closer to my target.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a collaborative and solution-oriented tone to encourage agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $975,000. This price acknowledges the product's value while still being within my budget. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's substantially higher than my minimum selling point ($800,000) and provides a healthy profit margin.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We've both moved closer to the middle ground, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation further carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me becoming too firm, potentially leading to a stalemate. It's better to secure a good deal now. 

**Outcome:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I will successfully sell the product for $975,000, exceeding my minimum price and securing a favorable outcome."
