"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you. I'm confident this price reflects a fair balance between our interests. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $600,000 is simply too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,000,000 is the lowest I can go at this point. This price still offers you a significant gain compared to your initial estimate. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise, considering the product's potential benefits to you. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product holds significant value.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This price acknowledges the value while working within my budget constraints.",750000.0,Bob,4,
