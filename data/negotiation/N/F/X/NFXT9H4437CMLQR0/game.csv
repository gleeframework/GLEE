,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $1500000 is significantly over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see something closer to my initial asking price. Let's try $1200000.  This is a fair price for the value this product offers.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
