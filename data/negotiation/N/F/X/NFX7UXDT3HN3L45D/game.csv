"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident that this product is worth $800,000 to me, and I'm willing to pay that amount.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I've thought it over, and I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'm now offering the product to you for $815,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value it holds for you.",815000.0,Alice,5,
