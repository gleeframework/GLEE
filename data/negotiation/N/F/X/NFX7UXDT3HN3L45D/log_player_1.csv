Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
