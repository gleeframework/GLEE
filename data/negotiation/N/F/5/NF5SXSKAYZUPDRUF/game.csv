"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is also below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Would you consider $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. My revised offer is $13,000 for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
