"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit high for me. How about $140? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $145, which is the lowest I'm comfortable selling this product for. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little hesitant at $145. If you're willing to go down to $140, I'm ready to buy it. Let's close this deal!",140.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $145 is still a bit high for you, and I'm willing to meet you at $140. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $142.50. That's the best I can do.",142.5,Alice,7,
