"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. Can you consider that price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but $1,075,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
