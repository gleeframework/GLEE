"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this stage. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your candor about the value of the product. However, $950000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1050000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you while also being fair to me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable right now.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  This price reflects the value to both of us and allows us to close this deal quickly.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1075000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable compromise from my end.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1075000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $1025000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, but I'd like to propose a small premium for the convenience of a quick sale. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000, but I'll throw in some additional services and support that will enhance the product's value to you. This way, you'll get the product at a great price, and I'll get a fair return on my investment.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not interested in the additional services at this time. I'm focused on getting the product at a fair price.  Let's stick to the price of $1025000. It's a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Bob,8,
