Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $900,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in this compromise.
