Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will bring you significant returns."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have a safety net. Offering the product to Bob at a higher price allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $1,500,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you can still settle on a price higher than your guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Justify the Price:** The message highlights the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer and that you are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer."
