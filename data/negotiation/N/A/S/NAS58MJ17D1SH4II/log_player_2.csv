{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so it makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

Bob is going to start with a fairly aggressive counteroffer. He's aiming for a significant discount, but it's still within the realm of reason. He's leaving some room for negotiation but showing Alice that he's serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still higher than John's price. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better deal before committing to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

Bob is going to increase his offer slightly, but it's still less than John's price. He's showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate, but he's also sticking to his goal of getting the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's offer is only $500 less than John's price, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a counteroffer.  It's better to go with the sure thing and save the hassle of further negotiation."
