"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's likely Bob will reject this offer. However, this will give me valuable information about his perceived value of the product and allow me to gauge his potential for a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush. Bob's low offer suggests he's not willing to pay much. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's initial offer, but it's still below my ideal selling price. I want to see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has increased his offer to $16,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price and a significant improvement from his previous offer. Accepting this offer is the best strategy at this point. While I might be able to get a slightly higher price with more rounds of negotiation, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or the negotiation process will drag on.  It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing the sale completely."
