"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum asking price, knowing that John is willing to pay that amount.  This sets a strong baseline and gives Bob a clear understanding of my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from my initial price, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to offer $950,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet halfway, but I still believe the product is worth more."
