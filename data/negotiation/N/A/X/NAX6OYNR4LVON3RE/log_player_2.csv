Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay right now. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Would you consider $10,750?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,750. I can offer you the product for $10,875. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Current offer vs. John:** Alice's offer of $10,875 is significantly lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has already rejected Alice's offers at $11,500 and $11,000, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  This offer is a good compromise. 
* **Potential for further savings:** While there's always the chance to try for a lower price, the risk is that Alice might walk away from the deal, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

**Conclusion:**  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
