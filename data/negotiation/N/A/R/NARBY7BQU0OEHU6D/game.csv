"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth $800000 to you, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for your business.  I'm willing to start with a price of $1300000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it reflects the value I place on this product.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
