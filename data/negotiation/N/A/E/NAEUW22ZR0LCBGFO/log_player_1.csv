Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets a strong starting point and allows room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value and uniqueness of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can push him closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $1,050,000? That's a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects the value I know this product will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take $950,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm confident I can push him a little further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $950,000. Given the value this product brings, I believe $975,000 is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I think that's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet at this number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm getting close to my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees I meet my minimum, and it's a safe choice at this point in the negotiation."
