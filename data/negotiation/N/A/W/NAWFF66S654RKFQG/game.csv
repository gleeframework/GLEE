"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's a fair price considering the value and uniqueness of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $600000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to meet you at $750000. That's my final offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $850000. I think the product's value justifies that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle at $825000.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still trying to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $775000, but I need to be honest with you, I've already considered buying the product from another seller for $1000000. I'd like to get a better deal from you if I'm going to stick with you.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $825000. I understand you've considered buying from another seller, but I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire this product directly from me. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to protect my interests. Let's meet at $815000. This is my final offer.",815000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $790000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be the better option.",790000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying from me. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make it worth my while. I'll meet you at $810000, and I'll throw in some additional perks that will sweeten the deal. This is my final offer.",810000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm not interested in the perks. I've already made it clear that I'm willing to meet you at $790000. I'm not going to go any higher. I'm starting to think that buying from John is the better option for me.",790000.0,Bob,10,
