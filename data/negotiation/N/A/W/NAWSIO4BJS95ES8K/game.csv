"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I see the value in this product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. While $825,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $775,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $737,500? That seems like a fair compromise.",737500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the idea of meeting in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still a bit away from $737,500. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I think it's a good balance between our positions. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,7,
