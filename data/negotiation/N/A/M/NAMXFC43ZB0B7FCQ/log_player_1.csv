Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000 (your guaranteed sale price to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price around $12,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still making the offer attractive to Bob.

This strategy seeks a balance between a high potential profit and a reasonable chance of acceptance from Bob."
