"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good price. It's a significant discount from the initial offer and only $50,000 more than Bob's counteroffer. Accepting this offer saves Bob a substantial amount compared to buying from John and offers a good balance between savings and finalizing the purchase."
