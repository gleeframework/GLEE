"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $119 is close to your maximum budget, there's a chance you could get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer, potentially saving you a few more dollars before resorting to buying from John."
