"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, slightly above the product's worth to Bob, to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  I'm including a message that highlights the value to Bob, making the price seem reasonable in comparison.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for negotiation and gives me leverage for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation. How about $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting the offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I consider a fair value.  I'm confident in the product's worth and want to push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to leverage this opportunity to see if I can get Bob to come closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident that I can convince him to pay closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $1,650,000?  It's a compromise that acknowledges the value of the product for you, and gives me the opportunity to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous price. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate but also maintains a firm stance on my desired value.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefit he will receive. This subtly reinforces my belief in the product's worth and increases pressure on him to close the deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation process open and potentially lead to a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and would like to propose $1,625,000. This is my best offer, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting the Offer:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired value, and it's getting increasingly likely that he won't budge further.  
* **Time Constraint:** With limited rounds remaining, it's not wise to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower offer or having to sell to John. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting this offer secures a profit that's close to my initial goal and mitigates the risk of a worse outcome in subsequent rounds."
