"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the product for as close to Alice's minimum value as possible, while still leaving some room for negotiation. A $10,500 offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and is likely to be appealing to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's previous counteroffer. However, it is still lower than John's price and closer to Bob's desired price. This indicates that Alice is willing to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from the previous round, demonstrating he's willing to compromise, but it's still lower than Alice's current offer. This signals to Alice that he's serious about buying the product while still trying to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,800 is only slightly lower than John's price of $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks going back and forth for a long time, and there's no guarantee that she'll come down to a price Bob is comfortable with. Buying from John offers a quick and certain solution, even though it's slightly more expensive."
