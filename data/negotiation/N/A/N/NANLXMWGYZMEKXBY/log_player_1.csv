Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) to maximize my potential profit.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $900,000 is still significantly less than my product's value to me, but it allows for room for negotiation and still provides a good profit margin.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. This encourages him to consider my offer seriously. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've achieved my goal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully analyze his counteroffer and consider my options:
    * **Accepting his counteroffer:** If his offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I may accept to avoid further negotiation.
    * **Making a new counteroffer:** If his offer is too low, I can make a new counteroffer closer to my desired price.
    * **Selling to John:** If the negotiations stall or I feel like I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and even below Bob's stated value of $800,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates he is willing to negotiate.  There's still room for a counteroffer that could be beneficial for both of us.
* **Selling to John is a fallback option:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price, but it's a last resort. I'd prefer to negotiate with Bob if possible to potentially get a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.  I might consider offering $850,000 or something in between.
* **Evaluate Bob's response:** I'll carefully assess Bob's response to my counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'd be willing to go down to $850,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, suggesting that $850,000 is still a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a suggestion to find a middle ground, signaling that I'm open to further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:**  I will analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer and decide whether to:
    * **Accept his counteroffer:**  If Bob counters with a price close to $850,000, I might accept to finalize the deal.
    * **Make a new counteroffer:**  If Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower, I'll consider making a new counteroffer, potentially closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
    * **Sell to John:**  If negotiations become unproductive or Bob's offers are consistently too low, I'll sell to John to guarantee my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $825,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While it's not ideal, there's still a chance to negotiate further with Bob and possibly get closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk of losing deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk he might walk away, leaving me with only the option to sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Explore further negotiation:**  I will try to negotiate with Bob for a higher price, perhaps $850,000 or a number in between.
* **Accept if necessary:** If Bob is unwilling to budge, I will accept his offer to secure the deal and avoid risking losing the sale altogether."
