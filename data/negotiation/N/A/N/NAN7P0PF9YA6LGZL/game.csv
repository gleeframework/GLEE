"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is there any flexibility in your pricing?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to be able to justify the cost to my team. Can you consider $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to justify the cost to your team. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",7800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession to $7800, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be able to get a good return on investment. Can you consider $6500?",6500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns about return on investment, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6500.
