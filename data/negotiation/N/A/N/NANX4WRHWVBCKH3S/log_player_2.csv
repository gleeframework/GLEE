"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to you, there's room for a deal that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a significant discount, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. I'm hoping this will kickstart the negotiation and lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a good compromise and only $500 more than my initial counteroffer. Accepting this offer saves me $500 compared to buying from John and ensures I get the product."
