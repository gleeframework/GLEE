{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's above your minimum threshold, giving you some room to negotiate. It also emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, potentially encouraging him to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum threshold of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away happy. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above your minimum threshold of $1,000,000 and is a good compromise.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal with Bob altogether."
