"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! It's a rare opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,000,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason:  While Alice is moving in the right direction, $950,000 is still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  Bob should counter with a price closer to his ideal goal of saving as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to offer you $925,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $975,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason:  Alice's offer of $975,000 is a good compromise.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a lower price, it's not guaranteed that Alice will budge further.  Considering the time spent so far, and the fact that Bob is close to his ideal price, accepting this offer is the best choice.  Also, buying from John for $1,200,000 would be a much worse deal than accepting Alice's offer."
