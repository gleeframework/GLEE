Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is substantial. I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but I need to see a significant step from your side to justify letting go of this valuable product. Would you consider $1,000,000?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a significant stretch for me. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $900,000.

I hope we can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 900000}
