"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $850,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still seeking a slightly higher return. How about we settle at $875,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",875000.0,Alice,5,
