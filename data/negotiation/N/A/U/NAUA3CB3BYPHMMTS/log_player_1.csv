Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed sale to John at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This is his likely maximum bid.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. For a deal to happen, you'd need to go below your minimum or Bob would need to pay more than it's worth to him.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the given information, you have two options:

1. **Aim for John:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John, it's in your best interest to move on from Bob quickly.
2. **High Anchor:** You could start with an extremely high offer to see if Bob is willing to negotiate beyond his perceived value. This is risky, as it could turn him off completely.

**The Offer**

Given the circumstances, aiming for John makes the most sense. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I move forward with another interested buyer.  My asking price is $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward about your intention to sell elsewhere.
* **High Price:** The price is significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This makes it likely he'll decline, allowing you to move on to John. 

**Important Note:**  While this offer is designed to lead you to the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, there's always a slight chance Bob might surprise you with a counter-offer. Be prepared to analyze any response he gives!"
