"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, he can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. He is still saving money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,750. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,750. I'm thinking of selling the product for $10,875. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could continue to negotiate, he is only saving a small amount of money by doing so. It's likely that Alice will not go lower than $10,875, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. It's a better deal than buying from John, and at this point, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential savings."
