"Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, however, my valuation for this product is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $1,800,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and shows my commitment to finding a deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
