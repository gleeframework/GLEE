Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price slightly below Bob's valuation increases the likelihood of a sale while still securing a significant profit. 
* **The Offer:** $1,400,000 leaves a $100,000 ""surplus"" for Bob (his valuation minus the price) while netting you $200,000 above your minimum.

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
