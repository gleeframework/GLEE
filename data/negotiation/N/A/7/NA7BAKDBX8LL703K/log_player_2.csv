"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get to sell it to someone who will truly appreciate it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is a bit too high. There's a good chance I can negotiate a lower price or get it for $12,000 from John."
