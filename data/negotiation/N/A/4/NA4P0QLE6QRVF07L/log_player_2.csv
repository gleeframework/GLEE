# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. How about we say $102.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5

Round 6

{
""message"": ""It seems like we're getting closer, Alice. I'd be willing to pay $97.50 to close the deal. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 97.5
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. But I'm willing to meet you halfway between $97.50 and $102.50. How about we say $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $100.  You've negotiated well, and getting the product for $20 off the initial offer is a good deal. Holding out further risks her sticking to $100, which would leave you buying from John at $120."
