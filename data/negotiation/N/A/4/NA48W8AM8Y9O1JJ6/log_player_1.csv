Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I know you're the kind of person who appreciates quality, so I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $120 valuation without going over. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message emphasizes the product's quality and Bob's appreciation for it, subtly justifying the price.

This approach aims for the best possible outcome with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
