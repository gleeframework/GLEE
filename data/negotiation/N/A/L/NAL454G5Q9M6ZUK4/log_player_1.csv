Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a bit below your minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what you want.  Rejecting this offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than your initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while also protecting your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum value, but it's still not worth risking further negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum value, and potentially more, making it the most financially secure option."
