,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $115?  I'm really interested in your product but I'm on a tight budget.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $115 is lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?  It's still a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  That's my final offer, and it's the absolute most I can afford.",120.0,Bob,4,
