"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair for both of us. My asking price is $950,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",950000.0,Alice,1,
