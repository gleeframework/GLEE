"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for something worth a lot to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is closer to my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to entice him. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Leaving room for negotiation allows for a potential compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to counter-offer if Bob rejects my initial offer. I'll also be watching for any signals that he's not interested in negotiating further. If it seems like he's not serious, I'll be ready to move on to John and secure the $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While I want to make a deal, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not willing to settle for that price yet.
* **Weighing Options:** I'm not ready to sell to John just yet.  There's a chance I can still get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but still showing flexibility.  I'll continue to monitor Bob's responses and be prepared to sell to John if he's not willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down to $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, hoping to persuade him to meet me halfway. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm injecting a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""close this deal,"" implying that I may not be willing to negotiate for much longer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll consider a slight further reduction, but I'm getting closer to my minimum value. If he continues to be unwilling to compromise, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,500. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Potential Loss:**  If I reject his offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing him altogether and having to sell to John for $15,000. 
* **Time Constraint:** I'm already four rounds in, and the negotiation process is taking longer than expected. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and minimize the risk of losing both Bob and a significant amount of potential profit."
