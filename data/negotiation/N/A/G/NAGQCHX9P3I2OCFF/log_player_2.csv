"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range of what the product is worth to him. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $105 is better than $110, it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $100?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making another counteroffer, but this time he's offering a price that's only slightly lower than Alice's last offer. This shows that he's serious about buying the product but still wants to get a good deal. This also keeps the negotiation moving forward and might convince Alice to accept a price closer to her bottom line."
