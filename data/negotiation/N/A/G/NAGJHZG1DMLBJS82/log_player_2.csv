{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is close to your maximum price, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer opens the door to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Clear and concise:**  The message is straightforward and lets Alice know you're serious about buying the product.
* **Focus on value:**  It implies that you see value in the product, but you're not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $900000? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice and gives you another opportunity to lower the price.  Remember, you have a limited number of rounds, so a slight compromise might be necessary, but not yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further delay."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Focus on Fair Deal:** Highlighting a ""fair price for both of us"" emphasizes a win-win situation.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning closing the deal without further delay subtly pressures Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. Let's meet in the middle at $890000. This price acknowledges the value you place on the product while allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, there's still a bit of room for negotiation.

It's important to remember that you have a limited number of rounds, but you're still trying to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $890,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** A small increase shows flexibility and commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Closing Language:** Emphasizing closing the deal without further delay adds pressure.
* **Fairness:**  Reiterating that this is a fair price for both parties reinforces the win-win scenario."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there. I'm willing to drop to $885000 for this product.  It's a fair price that recognizes the value you'll receive, and it allows us to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Progress:**  The price is very close to your target, and further negotiation might not yield significant savings.
* **Time Constraints:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice increases.
* **Potential Loss:**  If you reject Alice's offer and fail to reach a deal, you risk having to buy from John at a much higher price. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that is within your budget and allows you to avoid the risk of buying from John at a significantly higher cost."
