"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a great deal considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $950000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $900000? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further delay.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. Let's meet in the middle at $890000. This price acknowledges the value you place on the product while allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $890000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880000.  Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there. I'm willing to drop to $885000 for this product.  It's a fair price that recognizes the value you'll receive, and it allows us to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen!",885000.0,Alice,7,
