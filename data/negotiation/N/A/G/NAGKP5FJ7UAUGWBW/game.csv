"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $170 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I can sell it to you for $160. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $150. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider my offer?",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $155. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",155.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",130.0,Bob,6,
