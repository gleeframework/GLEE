It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $6,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for improvement."

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows you're serious about buying the product but are also looking for a good deal."

$5,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay at this point.  I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4750}

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  This price is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it might be more appealing to her."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $5,250 is closer to my goal, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}

Alice is now asking for more than I'm willing to pay, and we're running out of time.  It's better to buy from John at this point and secure the product."
