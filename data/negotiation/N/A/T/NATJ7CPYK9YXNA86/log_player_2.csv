{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's offer is above his maximum price point of $15,000, he should reject it.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still higher.  He can likely get it for less by continuing to negotiate.  The possibility of getting it for $15,000 from John keeps him motivated to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Since he has the option of getting the product from John for $15,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a better price. There's a chance he could get the price down to his desired $15,000 or close to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now making a very strong offer, only $500 above his target price of $15,000. This demonstrates his willingness to buy the product but also his desire to get a price as close to his limit as possible.  He's likely to be disappointed if Alice rejects this offer, but it's a reasonable move given the situation."
