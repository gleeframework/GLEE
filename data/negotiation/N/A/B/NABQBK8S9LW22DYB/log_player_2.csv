"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a very good price, but there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get it for even less. I'm not desperate to buy right away, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows me to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant price reduction. This helps establish my negotiating stance and sets the stage for potential compromise.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it gives me valuable information about her willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is still a good deal, it's within the range of what I'd be willing to pay if I were nearing the end of negotiations. However, I have plenty of rounds left, and I believe there's still potential to get a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue probing for a better price without rushing into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids the risk of Alice getting frustrated with too low of an offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $450,000 is a tempting price, I'm still holding out for a lower price. I believe that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can potentially get a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $350,000.  I'm not yet in a desperate position to accept a price that's still significantly higher than my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, showing that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway. This is a strategic move to signal that I'm serious about buying the product but also want to get the best price possible. It's a calculated risk, but I believe it could push Alice closer to my target price in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $475,000 is close to a price I'd be willing to accept, I'm still within the early stages of negotiations, and there's a chance I can push for a slightly lower price. Rejecting this offer and continuing the negotiation shows Alice that I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $450,000, which is now right in the middle of Alice's last offer ($475,000) and my previous offer ($400,000). This shows a clear commitment to reaching a compromise.  I'm hoping this final push will be enough to convince Alice to accept. If not, I'm prepared to accept her next offer, which is likely to be closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $487,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $487,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good price, and I'm running out of time. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident that I've gotten a significantly better price than what John was offering."
