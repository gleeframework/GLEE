Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm motivated to sell, $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, Thanks for your offer. I understand it's lower than I'd hoped. While I'm eager to find a buyer, I need to make sure the deal works for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price is a significant step towards your offer, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still outside my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8000.  If this doesn't work for you, I'm going to have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I value the opportunity to sell to him, his offer is still too far below my minimum.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round and try to work towards a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not able to go that low.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offer, and I hope it's a good starting point for us to find an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8000.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. We're reaching a point where we're unlikely to agree on a price that works for both of us. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's better than accepting Bob's offer. I'll keep an eye out for other potential buyers in the future."
