Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,400,000 vs. $1,000,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting other interested buyers (John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  We know we have John as a backup. 
* **Profitable Even with a Discount:** Even if Bob negotiates a lower price (within reason), we are still guaranteed a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000)."
