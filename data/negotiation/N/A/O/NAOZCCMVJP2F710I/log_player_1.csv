"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows for negotiation room.
* **Reasoning:** Providing a reason for the price (""value and potential"") makes the offer appear more legitimate. 
* **Openness:**  The message invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation room:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation and potentially getting closer to my desired price.
* **Time:** We are still early in the negotiation process (round 2 of 10)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still reflects the product's true value and its potential for you.  Let's find a middle ground to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reason:**  I'm not just rejecting Bob's offer; I'm providing a counter with a specific reason (value and potential) to justify my price. 
* **Moving closer:**  This counteroffer is a significant decrease from my initial offer ($1,750,000), but it's still above my minimum ($1,500,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** The message is  polite and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation window:** We have 6 rounds left, giving me time to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price.
* **John's offer:** While John is offering a higher price, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. This price reflects the product's value and also shows my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  This counteroffer is a significant decrease from my previous offer ($1,600,000), showing a willingness to compromise and move closer to Bob's price. 
* **Finality:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting this is a final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Reasoning:** I'm still justifying my price with the product's value and emphasizing my commitment to making a deal. 
* **Time:** We're halfway through the negotiation process, and I'm pushing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,550,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made several concessions, and it seems unlikely Bob will come up to my price.
* **John's offer:** John is offering me my minimum acceptable price and is a sure deal.  It's not ideal, but it's the safest option given the circumstances.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
