Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's strategy:**  Start with a significant counteroffer, hoping to push Alice closer to her desired price point of $12,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

* **Bob's strategy:** Increase his offer slightly from the previous round to show he's willing to compromise while staying within his budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible, but still get the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $15,000, which is Bob's maximum budget and the same price as John's offer.
* **Reason for choosing John:** There is no benefit to continuing negotiations with Alice at this point.  Bob can get the product for the same price from John, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a lower price."
