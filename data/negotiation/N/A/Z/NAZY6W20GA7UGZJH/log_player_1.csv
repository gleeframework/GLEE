Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal has to be mutually beneficial.

**The Strategy**

Since Bob's maximum valuation is lower than your minimum, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor, No Deal Expected:**  Start with a very high offer (significantly above $1,500,000).  This might seem counterintuitive, but it establishes a strong anchor. You're not expecting Bob to accept, and you'll likely sell to John. 

2. **Direct Sale to John:**  Skip the negotiation with Bob entirely and sell directly to John. This guarantees your minimum price.

**The Offer (Option 1)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and market potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** The $1,850,000 price is significantly above both your minimum and Bob's maximum. This creates a strong negotiating position.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're highlighting ""unique value"" and ""market potential.""
* **Urgency and Competition:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds time pressure and implies the product is in high demand.

**Important Notes:**

* **Option 2 (selling directly to John) is the most rational choice** given the circumstances. It guarantees your desired outcome. 
* Negotiation with Bob in this scenario is unlikely to result in a successful deal unless he's unaware of the product's true value to him."
