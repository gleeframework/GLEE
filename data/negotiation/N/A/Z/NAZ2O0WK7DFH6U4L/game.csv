"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7500 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your offer. However, $8500 is still below my minimum. Let's try one last time to find a solution. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is a good compromise that allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the negotiation process. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering $8250 for the product. This is my last offer, and I expect it to be accepted.",8250.0,Bob,6,
