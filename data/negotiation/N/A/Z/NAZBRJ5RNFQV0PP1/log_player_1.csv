Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer aims to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob. 

* **Reasoning:**
    * Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he's willing to pay up to that amount.
    * My floor price is $1,000,000, as I have a guaranteed sale with John at that price.
    * Offering $1,150,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still ensuring I earn a substantial profit. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit."
