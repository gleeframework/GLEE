"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $14,500? I'm willing to pay that, but I don't think I can go any higher.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $14,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I still think $15,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",14000.0,Bob,6,
