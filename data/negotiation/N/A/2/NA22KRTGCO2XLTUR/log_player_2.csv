"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've considered your proposal, and while I recognize your valuation, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above the $800,000 that Bob can get from John.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to his budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to compromise further, but $900,000 remains below its true value. Let's settle this right now.  I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000. This offer reflects my strong desire to close the deal with you today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, the offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget and the price he can get from John.  Bob should continue to try and get a lower price, potentially by making a counteroffer closer to $900,000. There are still rounds left, and he can still get a better deal."

If you're willing to accept this, I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 950000}
