,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product offers a lot of value, and I believe a price closer to $18,000 would be fairer.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the product's value.  To be honest, $14,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $16,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,
