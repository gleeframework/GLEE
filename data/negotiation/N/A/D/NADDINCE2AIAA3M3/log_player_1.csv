Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $950,000?  This would still represent a significant gain for you while allowing me to reach a price that works for me."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider a price of $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price range, and we are already halfway through the negotiations. It's a good deal for me, and there's a risk that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might walk away entirely.  I'm going to accept his offer to secure the sale."
