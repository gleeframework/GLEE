"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise that still gives me a good profit margin.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is getting closer, but to be honest, my absolute limit is $7,000. If you're able to make that work, I'm ready to close the deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",7200.0,Alice,5,
