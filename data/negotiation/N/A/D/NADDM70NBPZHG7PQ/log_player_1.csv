Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's above Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately off-putting.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message hints that the product is worth more than Bob's perceived value, potentially swaying his opinion.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning a ""special price"" and offering it to Bob ""first,"" it subtly implies he might miss out if he doesn't act quickly. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still being high enough to ensure a profit above Alice's minimum. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the security of John's guaranteed purchase at $150."
