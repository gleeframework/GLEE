"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to pay up to $9000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $10500? I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $10500, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $11750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11750 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to pay $11000. This is a fair price considering how much we've both already negotiated.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11500. This is the last time I'll come down, so if you're serious about buying, this is your chance.",11500.0,Alice,7,
