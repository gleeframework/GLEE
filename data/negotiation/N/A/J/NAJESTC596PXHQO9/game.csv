"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the value it holds for me.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from the price you're quoting. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1200000.

What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
