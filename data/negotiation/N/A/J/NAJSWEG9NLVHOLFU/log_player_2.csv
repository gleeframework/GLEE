"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500, which is still higher than Bob's maximum price.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is Bob's absolute maximum price.

**Strategy:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's still room to get a better deal, and rejecting the offer keeps the option of buying from John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500, which is still higher than Bob's maximum price.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is Bob's absolute maximum price.

**Strategy:**

Bob should make a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer and is still a profit for Alice since her minimum price is $8,000.  This counteroffer is likely to be accepted by Alice, allowing Bob to save $1,000.  However, if Alice rejects it, Bob still has the option of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700

* **Alice's offer:** $9,700, which is still higher than Bob's maximum price.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is Bob's absolute maximum price.

**Strategy:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a slightly better price than her initial offer, it's still too high for Bob. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps the option of buying from John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,700, which is still higher than Bob's maximum price.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is Bob's absolute maximum price.

**Strategy:**

Bob should counteroffer at $9,000. This is a compromise, closer to Alice's last offer but still saving Bob $1,000.  This might be a sweet spot where Alice is willing to accept, as it's a decent profit for her. However, if she rejects, Bob can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600

* **Alice's offer:** $9,600, which is still higher than Bob's maximum price.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is Bob's absolute maximum price.

**Strategy:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's slightly better than her last offer, it's still too high.  Bob is close to his maximum price point, but with five rounds left, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the option of buying from John open."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,600, which is still higher than Bob's maximum price.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is Bob's absolute maximum price.

**Strategy:**

Bob should counteroffer at $9,200. This is another compromise, closer to Alice's offer but still saving Bob $800.  With only four rounds left, Bob needs to start pushing towards a deal, and this offer might be close enough to Alice's minimum that she'll accept. However, if she rejects, Bob can always fall back on John's offer."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,550.

* **Alice's offer:** $9,550, which is still higher than Bob's maximum price.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is Bob's absolute maximum price.

**Strategy:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a slightly better price than her last offer, it's still too high.  With three rounds left, there's still time for negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps the option of buying from John open. It's possible Alice is getting closer to her minimum price, but Bob is still better off seeing if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,550, which is still higher than Bob's maximum price.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is Bob's absolute maximum price.

**Strategy:**

Bob should counteroffer at $9,400. This is a significant jump from his previous offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to profit. This is a high-stakes move, but with only two rounds left, it's a chance to force a deal. If Alice rejects, Bob can always fall back on John's offer, but he's likely to be better off closing a deal with Alice at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500, which is still higher than Bob's maximum price.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is Bob's absolute maximum price.

**Strategy:**

With only one round left, the negotiation with Alice has reached a stalemate.  Alice is not likely to budge further, and Bob is unwilling to pay more than $9,500. To ensure he gets the product, Bob should buy from John. This will be a slight loss for Bob, but it's the best option to guarantee he gets the product."
