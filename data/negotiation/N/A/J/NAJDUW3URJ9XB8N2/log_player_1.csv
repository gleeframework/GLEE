Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows you to potentially gain more than selling to John immediately.  Even if Bob negotiates down, you have room to work with. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer is a starting point. Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, and you can then decide if you want to accept a lower offer or stick to your bottom line (selling to John).
* **Value Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value by mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a wider release. This could make the price more palatable.

**Important:** It's crucial to gauge Bob's reactions and be prepared to adjust your strategy if needed. If he seems completely turned off by the price, you have the option to lower it slightly during the negotiation phase."
