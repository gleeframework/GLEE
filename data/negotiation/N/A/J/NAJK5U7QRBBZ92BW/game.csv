"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  My asking price is $1,000,000. This represents a significant saving for you and allows me to secure a profitable sale.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
