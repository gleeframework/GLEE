# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to negotiate from here. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price.**  You're aiming for a price under $1,500,000, and Alice is starting at $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  Alice has indicated a willingness to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is the fallback option.** You know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, so you have a safety net.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:**  You're starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price.  This creates a space for negotiation.
* **Communicate value and fairness:**  You're framing your offer as fair for both parties, acknowledging Alice's value for the product while stating your budget.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  By saying it's your ""best offer,"" you're setting a limit but also implying a willingness to discuss further if needed."
