"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's start with a price of $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good value for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This way, you'll still be getting a good deal, and I'll be able to get a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to each of us.  Let's try to make this deal work.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm thinking of a price of $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,7,
