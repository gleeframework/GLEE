"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's start with a price of $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good value for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This way, you'll still be getting a good deal, and I'll be able to get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget.  $11,000 is closer, but you should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to each of us.  Let's try to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm thinking of a price of $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, but it's still above your budget.  $10,000 is a significant improvement, but you still have room to negotiate, and you're not willing to give up the possibility of buying it from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above your budget, and you've already rejected her counteroffers multiple times. You've already made it clear you're not willing to go above $9,000, and Alice is not budging. Since you have the option to purchase the product from John for $8,000, it's the most logical choice at this point to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at a price that works for you."
