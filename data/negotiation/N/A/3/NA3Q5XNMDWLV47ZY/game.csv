"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $1500000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, reflecting the maximum I can afford and still find it a worthwhile purchase. I'm eager to explore this opportunity further if you're open to discussing a lower price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still beyond my budget.  Considering the value I've placed on this product, I can offer $900000. This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the value you see in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1050000.

"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility in these negotiations.  While I see the value in this product, $1050000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which represents a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can bridge the remaining gap to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
