"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's budget.  It's prudent to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no point in buying from John yet, as we might be able to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, reflecting the maximum I can afford and still find it a worthwhile purchase. I'm eager to explore this opportunity further if you're open to discussing a lower price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it's still beyond Bob's budget. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further attempts at getting a better price.  There's no need to buy from John yet, as a lower price might still be attainable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  Considering the value I've placed on this product, I can offer $900,000. This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the value you see in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the negotiations so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget.  He should continue to try to negotiate a lower price. There's still potential to get closer to his desired price point, and there's no need to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility in these negotiations.  While I see the value in this product, $1,050,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can bridge the remaining gap to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1025000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the negotiations so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer, $1,025,000 is still more than Bob's budget.  He's reached a point where the negotiations are unlikely to result in a price lower than $800,000.  It's better to avoid further rounds and buy from John at a guaranteed price within his budget."
