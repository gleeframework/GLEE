"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a game-changer in the industry and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! The product looks great, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to my budget, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $10,000 is pushing my absolute limit.  I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $9,750. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",9750.0,Bob,6,
