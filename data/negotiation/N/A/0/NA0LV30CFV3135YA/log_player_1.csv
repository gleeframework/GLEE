Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. I'll offer the product to him for $200.

{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer is equal to the minimum value the product has to me ($150), I will choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer.
