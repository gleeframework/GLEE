"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to pay less than $100. Could we agree on $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",92.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I still feel that $92.5 is a bit high. Would you consider $87.5?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's meet in the middle again. Would you be willing to go up to $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
