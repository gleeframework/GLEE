"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go up to $900,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offer, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been great to work with and I can tell we're close. I'm willing to come up a little bit from my last offer. How about $775,000 and we call it a deal?",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the game! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, so I'll do the same. I can offer you the product for $825,000. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,7,
