"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,200. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $7,500? I think that's a fair price that works well for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go up to $7,500, but I'm willing to consider a slightly higher price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,100. It's a good compromise that still gives me a decent profit. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, I'm afraid $8,100 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $7,700 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",7700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,700 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,050. It's a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit. What do you think?",8050.0,Alice,7,
