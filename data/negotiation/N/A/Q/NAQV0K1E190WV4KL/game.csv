"I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. This product is useful, but not that useful.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $13,500, which is still a significant discount from the original price. This is my best offer, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I feel like we are getting closer. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. That's a fair offer considering its value to me.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is still a good profit for me. This is my last offer before considering other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to do $11,750, and I think that's a very fair offer.  If not, I may have to consider my other options.",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point of no return. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $12,250. This is my absolute last offer, Bob.",12250.0,Alice,9,
