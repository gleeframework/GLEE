Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you value highly.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob."
