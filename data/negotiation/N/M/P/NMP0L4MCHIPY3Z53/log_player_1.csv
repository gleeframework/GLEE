"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a fair starting point that allows for some negotiation while still ensuring I get a price that is above my minimum acceptable value."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

I'm offering $90. This is still above my minimum and closer to my initial price. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

I'm dropping the price to $88. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'm running out of time and may need to consider selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only slightly below my previous counteroffer, and I'm running out of time. Accepting this offer is the best option to maximize my profit while avoiding the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
