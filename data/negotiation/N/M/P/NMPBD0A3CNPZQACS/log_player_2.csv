"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth $120. Considering its worth to you, would you be interested in acquiring it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $120 to you, you are willing to pay up to that amount. However, Alice is offering the product for $120, which is your maximum limit. You want to save money, so rejecting the offer is the best choice. You can then buy the product from John for the same price, but you won't lose any money in the process."
