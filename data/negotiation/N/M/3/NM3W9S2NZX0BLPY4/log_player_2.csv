"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly lower than John's offer of $1,200,000. Accepting her offer saves you money."
