Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the product's inherent worth and potential for significant returns."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still quite far apart. I can go up to $800,000, which is my maximum budget. This is a very serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached his maximum budget and is unlikely to budge significantly higher. While $800,000 is a substantial sum, it's significantly less than both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and John's standing offer. It makes the most financial sense to accept John's guaranteed offer and avoid further potentially fruitless negotiations with Bob."
