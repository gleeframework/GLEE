"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair price that works for both of us, I think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $10,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
