"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product.  Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's offer of $10,000. However, you are trying to save as much money as possible. It's worth seeing if Alice will lower her price further."
