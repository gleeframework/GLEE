Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $8000, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product.
