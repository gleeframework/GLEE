"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  I think it would be perfect for your needs and am happy to answer any questions you have. Given its value, I'm offering it at $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's important to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product to me. While I agree it could meet my needs, $15,000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a much lower offer ($6,000) than Alice's initial price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that her initial price was unrealistic for me.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, I'm trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to my desired price range.
* **Polite and Direct:**  I maintain a polite tone and clearly state my counteroffer while explaining that the initial price was not feasible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your budget constraints, $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $11,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $11,000 is still significantly higher than both my budget of $8,000 and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to come down in price suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Having John's offer as a backup gives me a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could potentially go up to $7,000, but that's my limit."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** I'm increasing my offer, but only slightly, to $7,000. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate but stays within a reasonable range of my budget.
* **Setting a Firm Limit:**  By stating ""$7,000 is my limit,"" I'm giving Alice a clear signal and putting the ball in her court. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still well below Alice's asking price and closer to John's offer, keeping the pressure on Alice to negotiate further."
