"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend $8,500, but I'm still a bit below that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",9200.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $9,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to make it more appealing. I'm counteroffering $9,150. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9150.0,Alice,5,,
