Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too low.  I want to get closer to my goal of $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's still a great deal for you, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This still saves you some money while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $10,000 is still a significant profit and a good deal considering I could sell to John for $8,000.  It's important to remember that I have limited rounds, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing both Bob and John as buyers."
