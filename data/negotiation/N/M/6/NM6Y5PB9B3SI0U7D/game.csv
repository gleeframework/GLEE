"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $17000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $10000. I'll make one more counteroffer: $16000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $15000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us both.",15000.0,Bob,6,
