# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll agree it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While Alice's offer is higher than her personal value of the product, it's still significantly lower than what you would pay from John.  This means you can save $300,000 by accepting Alice's offer."
