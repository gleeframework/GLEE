Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above Bob's perceived value:** It gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Is below your minimum:** It leaves you room to make concessions if necessary.
* **Offers a clear and concise message:** It outlines the offer and encourages Bob to respond. 

By starting with this offer, you create a good foundation for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is a better offer than Bob's initial perceived value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than your minimum desired price of $12,000. It's important to remember that you have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain your leverage and can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and come down from your initial asking price.
* **Offers a reasonable compromise:** $9,500 is closer to Bob's offer, but still closer to your desired price.
* **Reinforces the value proposition:** It reminds Bob of the product's value and makes it seem like he's getting a good deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both parties, increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? It's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still below your ideal price of $12,000, it's significantly closer to your minimum desired price of $12,000. You've already rejected Bob's offer twice and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you much higher. 

Given that you have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $12,000, accepting Bob's offer at $9,000 is a reasonable outcome. You'll still be able to make a decent profit and avoid potentially lengthy and unproductive negotiations with Bob."
