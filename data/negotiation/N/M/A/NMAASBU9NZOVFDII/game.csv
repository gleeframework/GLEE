"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think!",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $115 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could we do $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I think that's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell you're serious about selling this, and I am interested, but I have a firm budget.  How about $100 even?  That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
