"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $18,000. I believe it holds significant value and this price reflects its worth.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I believe it's a good starting point for negotiations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is quite a way off from what I can accept.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to cover my costs and the value of this product. Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
