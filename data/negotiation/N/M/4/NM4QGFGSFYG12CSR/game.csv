"I'm interested in the product, but $800000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can you meet me in the middle?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $600000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $600000. I'm offering it to you for $700000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $650000. Can you meet me at this price?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're getting closer to my target, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. I'm offering it to you for $680000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",680000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already given you a significant discount from my original price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. I'm offering it to you for $670000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",670000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to make a final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $670000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $660000 and $670000, so I'm offering $665000. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",665000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm disappointed that we're still so far apart, Bob. I've already given you a significant discount from my original price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.
