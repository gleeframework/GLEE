Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to be willing to pay a significant price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I think I can get a little more from Bob. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still trying to get closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair midpoint and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to $9,500, $9,200 is still a good price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for a lower price.  It's important to recognize when a negotiation has reached a point where it's better to accept a slightly lower offer than to risk getting nothing at all."
