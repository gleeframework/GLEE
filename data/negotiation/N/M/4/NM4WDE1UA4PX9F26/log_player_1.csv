"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still below my ideal target. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, especially considering Bob's initial rejection of my offer. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my target.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $12,500. While it's still not my ideal price, it's a fair deal and a decent profit.  We're already at round 4, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  At this point, it's more important to close the sale and secure the profit than to hold out for a higher price."
