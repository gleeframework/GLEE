"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my best price for now.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I like that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras, like a 2-year warranty and dedicated support, to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer on price, but I'm open to negotiations on the extras.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the extras you're including. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product with the added warranty and support. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
