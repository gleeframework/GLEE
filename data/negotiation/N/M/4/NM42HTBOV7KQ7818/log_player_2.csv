"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my best price for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I like that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras, like a 2-year warranty and dedicated support, to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer on price, but I'm open to negotiations on the extras. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems stuck at the $1,200,000 mark. It's unlikely she'll come down significantly from there. We should send one more offer to test her willingness to negotiate, but be prepared to walk away and go with John if she doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer and the extras you're including. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product with the added warranty and support. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:** In this round, we're going for a slightly bolder approach. Offering her exact value lets her know we're serious but also aren't willing to budge much more. By calling it our ""final offer,"" we're increasing the pressure for her to make a decision."
