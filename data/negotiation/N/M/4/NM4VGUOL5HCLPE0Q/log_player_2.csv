"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $95 is below his maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit high for me. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for a product you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $90 is closer to his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of a lower price open."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 87}
