,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below my valuation for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential of this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't go as low as $1,100,000. My final offer is $1,225,000.  This is a considerable investment for you, but I'm confident you'll see an excellent return on that investment.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
