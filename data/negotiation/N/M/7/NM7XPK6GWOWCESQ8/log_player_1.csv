Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $812,500 is above my minimum value of $800,000 and within a reasonable range of my desired price. It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept it."
