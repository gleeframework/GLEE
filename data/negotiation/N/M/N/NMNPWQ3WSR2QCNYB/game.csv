"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm feeling confident that we can strike a deal at $1,100,000. This would be a good price for both of us, and we could close this deal today. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I value the product, $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",1110000.0,Bob,6,
