Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that will be a great addition to your portfolio. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob and using positive language to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.

**Why this strategy?**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:** Starting high allows for a larger potential profit.
* **Test Bob's willingness to pay:** This price will quickly reveal if Bob is serious about buying the product.
* **Set a strong initial position:** This sets a high bar for negotiation, giving me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would mean selling the product for less than what I could get from John.  I'll counteroffer to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, which is a significant concession but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, implying that even at $1,050,000, he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to Finding Common Ground:** I'm using positive language and emphasizing my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution, showing flexibility without compromising my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum requirement.  Therefore, it's more beneficial to sell to John for $1,000,000 and secure a guaranteed profit."
