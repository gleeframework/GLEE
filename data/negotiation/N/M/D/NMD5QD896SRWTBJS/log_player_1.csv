Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so anything above that is a win.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** The difference between Bob's value and your minimum is your negotiation space ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000 = $300,000).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum value increases the chances of acceptance.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I value it highly, but I believe in finding the right fit.  I'm willing to make this happen for you at $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Start by emphasizing the product's value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Letting Bob know others are interested creates a reason to act quickly.
* **Attractive Price:** The offer is significantly below Bob's maximum value, making it appealing.
* **Clear Call to Action:** It's clear this is a time-sensitive offer.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might try to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide if you want to negotiate further or proceed with John."
