{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,250,000 is a better deal than John's $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  This counteroffer is a bold move, offering a price closer to Alice's minimum value while still leaving room for compromise.  It's a strong starting point for negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's last counteroffer, but it's closer to Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a price closer to $1,150,000.  It's a calculated risk, but Bob has time to negotiate further and could get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a significant move here, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will need to re-evaluate his strategy and potentially consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable.  The negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and Bob has already made several concessions.  It's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to lower her price significantly, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.  

At this point, buying from John for $1,500,000 becomes a more attractive option. While it's not the ideal price, it guarantees a deal and prevents further wasted time and effort in negotiation."
