{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is far too high. It's above your maximum budget of $12,000.  It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $12,000. This is the most I'm willing to pay, and it leaves no room for further negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll move on to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial $12,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying, but I'm still not willing to go much higher. This is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Alice will accept it.  If not, I'll still have the option of buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. This shows Alice that I'm flexible and willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to cave to her demands. Hopefully, she'll see that my offer is fair and close to her value of $15,000. If she rejects this, I'll likely go to John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but $15,500 is still above my budget. I'm not willing to pay that much. There are still a few rounds left, and I think I can get a better price.  I'll continue negotiating and see if I can reach a more favorable deal. If not, I'll move to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer again to $14,500. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer of $14,000 and Alice's offer of $15,500. This is a fair price, and hopefully, Alice will see that. If she rejects it, I'm likely to go to John as we are getting close to the end of the rounds."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still asking for more than I am willing to pay.  We are down to the last round, and I'm not sure I can get her to budge any further. Since I can get the product from John for my maximum price of $12,000, it makes more sense to buy it from him now.  It's a much more financially sound decision."
