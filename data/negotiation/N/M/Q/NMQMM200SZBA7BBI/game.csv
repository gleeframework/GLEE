"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value to me, but $95 is a bit steep. How about $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase it immediately.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 doesn't quite cover my costs. Let's split the difference - how about $90? It's still a great price for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale.",90.0,Alice,3,
