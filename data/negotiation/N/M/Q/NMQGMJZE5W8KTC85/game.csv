"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference - $10,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finally close this transaction.",10000.0,Alice,5,
