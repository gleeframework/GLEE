Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,200,000.  This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:**  I'm guaranteed to make a profit.
* **It's within Bob's range:**  He values the product at $1,000,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It sets a high bar:**  It encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, which gives me more information and negotiating leverage. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on:

* **How close is his counteroffer to my desired price?**
* **How much time do I have?**  If John is waiting, I may need to accept a lower offer sooner.
* **How determined is Bob?** If he seems eager to buy, I can hold out for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **It's too low:**  While $900,000 is still profitable, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and my desired outcome.
* **I have other options:** I can either counteroffer Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000. 
* **It's a negotiation:**  Bob's low counteroffer suggests he's willing to negotiate. I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price.

I'll now make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll need to carefully consider my offer amount to keep the negotiation moving forward while trying to maximize my profit."

{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,050,000.  This is my reasoning:

* **Meeting in the middle:** It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Still profitable:**  It's well above my minimum, ensuring a good profit.
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness. If he's willing to accept, it's a win for me. If he rejects, it'll give me more information about his negotiating range. 

I'm cautiously optimistic.  My counteroffer is more likely to be accepted than my first offer, but I'm still in a strong position if it's rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **It's still too low:** While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable offer. 
* **The risk of a counteroffer:** If I accept this offer, I might regret it if Bob would have been willing to go higher. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safer and more profitable option at this point.

However, I am not ready to give up on Bob completely. I will make one more counteroffer to see if I can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  Here's why:

* **My minimum:** I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000. It's my minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing Bob's limit:**  This offer gives Bob one last chance to accept a deal that's still profitable for him.
* **Ready for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to move forward with John. I'm confident that he'll be happy to buy the product at my minimum price. 

This is a high-stakes offer. It's a gamble, but I believe that it's worth taking."
