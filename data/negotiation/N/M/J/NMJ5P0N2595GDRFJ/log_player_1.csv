Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more. I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $1075000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1060000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still confident that I can get a higher price, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum asking price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
