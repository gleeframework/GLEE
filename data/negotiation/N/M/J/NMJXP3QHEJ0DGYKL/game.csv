"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
