"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
