"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can potentially save $500 by rejecting the initial offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still within your budget and only $500 more than your initial counteroffer. It's a fair compromise, and you're better off accepting this offer than risking going back and forth further or buying from John at a higher price."
