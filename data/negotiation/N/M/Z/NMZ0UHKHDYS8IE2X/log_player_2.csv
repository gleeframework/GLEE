# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a one-year warranty and a personalized consultation. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $16,250. This is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.

Bob is getting close to his maximum price but is still not happy with the price.  Alice is showing a strong desire to sell, but Bob does not want to risk going further into the negotiation.  He's happy to get the product from John, who is willing to sell for the maximum price Bob is willing to pay."
