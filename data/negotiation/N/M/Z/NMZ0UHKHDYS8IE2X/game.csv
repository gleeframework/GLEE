"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can get a better deal elsewhere.  I'm willing to offer $15,500.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a one-year warranty and a personalized consultation. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $16,250. This is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",16250.0,Alice,5,
