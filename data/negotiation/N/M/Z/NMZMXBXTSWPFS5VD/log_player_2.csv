"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. You don't know how much she needs to get for the product.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to find a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range of what you're willing to pay.  This creates some room for negotiation while also showing that you're serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $7500 is lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8500? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to try and push her price down further.  It's important to keep trying to get the best deal possible before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming for a compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and your previous offer. This shows you're serious about buying the product but still want a good deal.  It also leaves some room for Alice to come down slightly if she needs to."
