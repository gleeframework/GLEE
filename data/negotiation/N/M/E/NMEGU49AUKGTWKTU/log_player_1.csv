Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $13,000 is still a little lower than I'd like, but I want to see if I can negotiate further before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm happy to come down to $13,500.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $13,000 is closer to my goal, I still believe I can get a better price if I keep negotiating.  I'm not in a rush, and I'm confident I can achieve a higher price with a few more rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close on price, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and agree on $13,250? It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 13250}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  We're getting close, but I'm not ready to settle for $13,100 yet.  I'm confident that with a couple more rounds of negotiation, we can reach a price that works for both of us.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 at any point, so I'm not in a rush to close the deal at a price that's not satisfactory."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a price we both feel good about.  I'm willing to go down to $13,150.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13150}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Okay, this time I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, I'm getting close to the number of rounds I'm willing to negotiate and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $12,000.  $13,100 is a good price, and it's better than settling for the lower price from John."
