"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $950000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me at $980000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $920000. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go down to $920000, but I'm not ready to accept that price yet. I'm going to make a new offer that's a bit higher than your last one. I'll sell the product to you for $960000. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging from this price. What do you think?",960000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $920000, but that's as low as I can go. Please reconsider and meet me at this price.",920000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm going to make one last offer that's right at the middle point between what I want and what you're willing to pay. I'll sell the product to you for $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making one last offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm going to have to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to buy the product from John for $800000, and I think that's a fair price. I hope you can reconsider and meet me at that price.",800000.0,Bob,10,
