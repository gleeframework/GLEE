"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  I could consider $1,075,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the revised offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000. I believe this is the best compromise considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this offer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I value this potential deal and I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 as my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
