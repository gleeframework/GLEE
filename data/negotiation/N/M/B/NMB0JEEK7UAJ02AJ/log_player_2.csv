"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high. While it's below your maximum budget, there's significant room for negotiation. A counteroffer will likely result in a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the negotiation closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll continue to counteroffer strategically."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"",
