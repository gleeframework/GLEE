"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product and would like to make a counteroffer of $8,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000?  That's still a great price for this product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I've given it some thought and am willing to increase my counteroffer to $8,800. This still allows for a fair deal for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $9,400? This gives us both a good deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",9400.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $8,900 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while staying within my budget.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  $8,900 just isn't enough for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200.  This is a final offer from me, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options. ",9200.0,Alice,7,
