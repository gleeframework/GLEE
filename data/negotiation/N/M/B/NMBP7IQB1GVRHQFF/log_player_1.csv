Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180,  a little higher than Bob's perceived value.  I want to see if I can get a good starting point.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down a bit, but I'm not going to give it away for $150 unless I have to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $120 is not acceptable. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $160. It's a compromise, and I'm hoping it'll be acceptable to Bob. If not, I'm prepared to keep negotiating, but I won't go lower than $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $140 is still too low for me. I'm going to make one more counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to sell the product for $150, which is my minimum price. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John."
