"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I make a good profit.  I'm confident that I can get at least $15,000 from John, so this is a safe starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is far too low.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I still have 8 rounds to go, so there's time to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but it still gives me a good profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I still have several rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good profit for me. I believe that Bob is starting to realize that my product is worth more than $12,000. I'm hoping he will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I have 4 rounds left and I think I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm going to offer $15,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm willing to drop my price further if needed. However, I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the value in my product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my minimum price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $15,000. It's time to secure the deal with John and move on."
