"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is significantly below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to facilitate this deal. It's still a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, but I still think that's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. That's my final offer.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
