"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to both of us. This product, which I am confident you will find invaluable, is priced at $950,000. My goal is to ensure that we reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I believe this price reflects the true worth of the item while allowing for a fair profit on my end. I look forward to discussing the details with you further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget:** You are willing to pay no more than $1,000,000. Alice is asking for $950,000, which is still too high.
* **John's offer is your fallback:**  While John's price is higher, it's still within your budget. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to go with John as a backup. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or move forward with John's offer."
