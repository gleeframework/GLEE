"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider a price closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $10,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider $14,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
