"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  It makes sense to reject and counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my limits. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $900,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm going to reject her offer and try to get closer to my target price. There are still rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence. I understand you're working within a budget, but the value of this product is substantial. I could consider letting it go for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above my budget.  I have a couple of options:

* **Reject and counteroffer:** I could try to get closer to my $950,000 target by making another counteroffer.
* **Buy from John:**  Since Alice is saying this is her final offer, I could just go ahead and buy from John for $800,000.  This would guarantee I get the product within my budget.

In this case, I'm going to **reject and counteroffer** one more time. I'm willing to risk losing the deal to John, but there's still a chance Alice might come down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still working within a tight budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  If you're serious about selling, I think we can make this work.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
