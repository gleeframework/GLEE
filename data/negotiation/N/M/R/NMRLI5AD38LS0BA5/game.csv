"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too pricey for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I'm willing to come down to $160 for you. I think that's a fair deal considering the value it brings.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $110 is closer to what you're thinking, I can't go that low.  How about $135? That's my final offer.",135.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit much for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my limit.",120.0,Bob,6,
