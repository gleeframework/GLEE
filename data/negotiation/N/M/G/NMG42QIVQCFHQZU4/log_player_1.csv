Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $115. This is a bit more than Bob values the product, but it leaves some room for negotiation and still allows me to make a profit.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
``` 

I'm offering $112.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough.  I've already been through a few rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that we're not likely to find a price that's satisfactory to both of us.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I get the best possible price and avoid any further negotiations with Bob."
