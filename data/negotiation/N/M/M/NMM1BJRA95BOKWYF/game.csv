"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to consider your product at $8,500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? This would allow both of us to walk away happy with the transaction.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500 is too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000. How about we settle on $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",9750.0,Alice,5,
