Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's well above your estimated value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is closer to my minimum, but I can likely get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000.  This is a good price for both of us - it's significantly lower than your initial price, but still above your estimated value. Let's try to find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price just above his offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point.  $925,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a little bit away from my ideal price. How about we split the difference and go with $937,500? It's a fair price for both of us and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 937500}
