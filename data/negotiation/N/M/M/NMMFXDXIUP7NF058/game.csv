"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's well above your estimated value.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000.  This is a good price for both of us - it's significantly lower than your initial price, but still above your estimated value. Let's try to find a compromise here.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point.  $925,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a little bit away from my ideal price. How about we split the difference and go with $937,500? It's a fair price for both of us and it gets us closer to a deal.",937500.0,Alice,5,
