"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to adjusting the price based on your feedback.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is my maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the benefits you'll receive from the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but still reflects the value I believe the product holds. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go below this point.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
