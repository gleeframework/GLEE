Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he won't pay more than that.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum.  Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the current valuations, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor, Possible Negotiation:** Start with a high offer significantly above Bob's valuation. This might make him counter-offer, giving you room to negotiate down towards your minimum.

2. **Accept John's Offer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, you can forgo negotiating with Bob altogether.

**Offer (Option 1 - Negotiation Attempt)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have a counter-proposal."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Anchor:** The $1,800,000 starting point is significantly above Bob's valuation, creating an anchor.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly invites Bob to counter-offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate.

**Important Notes:**

* **Success isn't guaranteed:** Bob might outright reject the offer, especially if he's aware of your alternative buyer.
* **Time sensitivity:** If you're concerned about delays, accepting John's offer might be more efficient.

**Option 2 (Accept John's Offer) would involve no message to Bob, as you'd proceed directly to selling to John.**"
