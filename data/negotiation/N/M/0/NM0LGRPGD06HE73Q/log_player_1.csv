Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially secure a better deal with Bob.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet. The product is worth more than $900,000 to me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $925,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have 6 rounds left to potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm committed to seeing if I can secure a better deal with Bob before turning to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $937,500. This would allow me to get closer to my target price while still making the product attainable for you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 937500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate the effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Based on my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $920,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will help us move closer to closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm starting to run out of rounds, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  $920,000 is still quite a bit lower than my desired price, and John's offer is a secure fallback. I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this deal work, but I need to be closer to my target price.  Let's compromise at $930,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within your budget.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 930000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your efforts to find a compromise. I am willing to consider a price of $922,500 for the product. I believe this price offers a reasonable balance between the value of the product and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will lead us towards a successful conclusion of the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $922,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $922,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last two rounds. While Bob has come closer to my desired price, it is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I do not have time to risk further negotiation and potentially get stuck with a price lower than what I could get from John. It's time to secure the guaranteed deal with John."
