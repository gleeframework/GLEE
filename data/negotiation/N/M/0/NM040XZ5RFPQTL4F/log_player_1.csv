{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also higher than the product's value to Bob, making it potentially attractive.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. I highlight the deal's value to him, prompting a positive response. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to start negotiations by offering a price slightly lower than my minimum. This creates a margin for further negotiation while still securing a good price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I will assess his counteroffer. 
* If his counteroffer is too low, I will make a counter-counteroffer.
* If negotiations stall, I will  consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's a compromise, it's still too far below my value threshold.  

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. I'm not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions. I'll also consider the risk of losing the deal with Bob and selling to John, but I'm determined to maximize my earnings."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This price is a midpoint between my initial offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000. It's a significant compromise on my part, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's compromise while highlighting the value of the product. I frame the price as a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum price. I'm hoping this midpoint price will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the counteroffer, I will finalize the sale.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I will need to consider my options, including making another counteroffer or selling to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'd like to try to get even closer. How about we settle on $1,150,000?

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:**  This price is a compromise, bridging the gap between my previous offer of $1,250,000 and Bob's latest offer of $1,150,000.  It's a significant concession on my part, but still allows me to get closer to my desired price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes my willingness to negotiate. I acknowledge Bob's persistence while reaffirming my value for the product.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum price. I'm hoping this final concession will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'd like to try to get even closer. How about we settle on $1,100,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made significant concessions, and it's becoming clear that a deal with Bob is unlikely.  I'm not willing to risk losing the deal and settling for a price that significantly undervalues the product.

**Strategy:**

It's time to move on and secure the sale with John.  While I would prefer to negotiate a higher price, selling to John guarantees a profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities.

**Next Steps:**

I will contact John and finalize the sale.  I've learned that it's important to set clear boundaries and not be afraid to walk away from a deal if it doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
