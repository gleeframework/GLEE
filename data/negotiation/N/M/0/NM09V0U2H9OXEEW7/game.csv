"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $810,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to move forward with the purchase at this price.",810000.0,Bob,4,
