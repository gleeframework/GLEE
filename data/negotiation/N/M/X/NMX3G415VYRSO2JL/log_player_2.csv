Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice and try to get the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1200000, which is my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, even though it means giving up the possibility of a slightly lower price from Alice.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is that she might become unwilling to sell or further increase her asking price."
