{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer. $9,000 is over your budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,500.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and hopefully shows I'm serious about buying, but still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  While $8,500 is closer to my budget, I still want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice $8,000.  This is my absolute maximum price, and I'm hoping she'll take it to avoid losing the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my maximum price, but I've already made my final offer. At this point, I'm better off buying from John for $8,000 to ensure I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with.  There's no guarantee I'll be able to negotiate any lower with Alice, and I'm running out of rounds."
