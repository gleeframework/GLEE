"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
