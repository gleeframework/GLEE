"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $90 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $80, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go above $80. Can you meet me at that price or is there a reason you can't sell it to me for $80?,80.0,Bob,6,
