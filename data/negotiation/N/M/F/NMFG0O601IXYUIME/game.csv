"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,212,500. That's a fair price for both of us and lets us finalize the deal.",1212500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I could go up to $1,190,000, but I'd need you to meet me there to seal the deal.",1190000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,190,000 is still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This gives us both a good deal and lets us finalize the sale. Let's close this now.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
