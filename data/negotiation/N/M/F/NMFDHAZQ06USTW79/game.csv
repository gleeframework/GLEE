"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $1300000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me and the fact that John is willing to sell it to me for the same price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000.

This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
