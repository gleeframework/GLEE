"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $15,000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good start, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
