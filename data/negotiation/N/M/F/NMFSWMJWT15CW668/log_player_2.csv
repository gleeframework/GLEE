"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  I can potentially save more money by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good start, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a significant discount from her original price.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to $10,000, it's unlikely she'll go lower.  Accepting her offer saves me $3,500 compared to buying from John."
