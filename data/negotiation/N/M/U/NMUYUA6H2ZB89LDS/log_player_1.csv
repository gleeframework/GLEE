"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting price is quite high. While I recognize the value of the product, I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly still significantly undervaluing the product. While his offer is increasing, it's important to hold firm and demonstrate that the value of the product is far greater than his current bids.  We are still willing to negotiate, but moving to John is becoming a stronger option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart on price.  To be frank, $750,000 is less than I would consider acceptable. To move this forward, I'm willing to drop to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects my strong interest in closing a deal with you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a noticeable price drop to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.  
* **Maintaining Value:** The offer is still significantly above Bob's bids, reinforcing the product's high value. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, we're increasing the pressure for Bob to make a serious offer while leaving ourselves the option of John's deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's make this simple: I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** Bob's offer is getting much closer to our minimum, but we're still leaving money on the table.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  With only a few rounds left, we need to decide if squeezing more out of Bob is worth the risk of him walking away. We're very close to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Final Push:**  A firm rejection here signals to Bob that we're serious about a higher price and might push him closer to our acceptable range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting close. Your offer is tempting, and I appreciate you moving in the right direction.  However, to make this worthwhile for me, I need to see a price of $1,100,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  We're making it clear this is our last offer to encourage Bob to take it seriously. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** We are moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above our minimum acceptable price, making it a fair compromise. 
* **Time Limit:** With few rounds left, the pressure is on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Backup Plan:** We're still positioned to walk away and take John's offer if necessary."
