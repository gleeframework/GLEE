Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $100 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a small discount while allowing you to maximize your profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
