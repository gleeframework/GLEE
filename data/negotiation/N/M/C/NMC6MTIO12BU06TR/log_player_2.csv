**Explanation:**

* **Your Value:** You value the product at $150.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice offers the product for $120. 
* **John's Price:** John sells the product for $150.

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum value and John's price, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer. You save $30 compared to buying from John."
