"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a better price can be reached, but buying from John is always an option if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $8,000 limit.  Since he can get the product for that price from John, there's no reason to accept. He should continue negotiating with Alice, aiming to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $9,250 for the product."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer the product to you for $10,000, which is the price I was originally willing to sell it to John for. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget of $8,000. Since Bob can get the product for $8,000 from John, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice.  It's in Bob's best interest to buy from John and get the best deal."
