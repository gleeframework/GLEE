"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This price still reflects the product's value and potential, while offering you a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
