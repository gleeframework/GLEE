"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exclusive product to you for $20,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at $10,000. Would you consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
