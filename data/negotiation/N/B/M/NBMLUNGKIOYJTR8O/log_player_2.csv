# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you value the product at $15,000, Alice is offering it for $13,000, which is a better deal.
* **You have room to negotiate further.** You can potentially try to lower the price further, but accepting the current offer is still a good choice."
