Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $8,000, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $8,000 to you, you are subtly anchoring Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering it at $10,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a safety net â€“ John is willing to buy the product for $8,000 if Bob declines.  

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation."
