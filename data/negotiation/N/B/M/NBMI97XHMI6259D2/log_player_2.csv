"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is a decent amount below my maximum price, but it's still significantly more than what it's worth to her. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 
Explanation: I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but still gives us room to negotiate. I want to aim for somewhere close to the middle of our valuations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but it's still a bit high. I'll reject and try to inch closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $95?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

Explanation: I'm sticking close to my previous counteroffer, sending a signal that I'm serious about this price range.  Hopefully, Alice will be willing to meet closer to the middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $102. This is my final offer, as I need to consider other buyers who are willing to pay a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Explanation: Alice is using the ""final offer"" tactic and it's getting close to the point where further negotiation might not be productive. $102 is a reasonable compromise, especially considering John's price of $150. It's better to secure a decent deal now than risk it for a slightly lower price."
