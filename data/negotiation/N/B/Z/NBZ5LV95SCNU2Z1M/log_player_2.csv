It's better to try and negotiate with Alice further. You can likely get a better price than $950,000, which is still too high for your budget."

This counteroffer shows you are serious about buying the product but are still trying to get a better price. It's a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your budget."
