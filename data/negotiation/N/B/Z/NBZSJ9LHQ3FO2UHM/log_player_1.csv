"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I believe the product is worth to me ($100). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly highlighting the value of the product to Bob by suggesting he'll enjoy it. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation and am interested in the product. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit. 
* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John for $100 would be a safe option, but I'm hoping to get more.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my desired price, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""a bit too low"") to make it seem more reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Focus on Agreement:**  I'm framing the offer as a way to reach an agreement, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $97.50 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to get as close to $100 as possible. 
* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not at my minimum price point.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate higher, especially since we've already made some compromises. 
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John for $100 is still an option, but I'm hoping for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price in the $99-$100 range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to go a little higher, but I can't go below $99.  That's my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:**  I'm increasing my offer to $99, showing a willingness to compromise further.
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a justification for my final offer (""my final offer"") to make it seem more reasonable.
* **Directness:**  I'm being direct and concise, focusing on the key point: the offer. 
* **Decision Time:** I'm giving Bob a clear decision to make, increasing the likelihood of a quick resolution."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see, Alice. Thank you for your offer. I would like to counter with $97 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're already at round 6, and each round brings us closer to my minimum price of $100. 
* **Small Difference:** The difference between Bob's offer of $97 and my desired price of $100 is now quite small.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continued negotiation might lead to a stalemate, and I risk losing valuable time.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is my minimum.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd like to get closer to $100, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to John is the safest and most practical option at this point."
