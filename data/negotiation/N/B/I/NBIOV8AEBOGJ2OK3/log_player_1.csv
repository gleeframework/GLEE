"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a decent starting point that reflects the value of the product to me while leaving some room for negotiation.  I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than $80, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counter-offering at $105. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping the price above Bob's offer.  I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating in the hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price. I'm aware that John is a guaranteed buyer for $120, but I'm still optimistic about getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100 in this round.  I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm also running out of time.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I need to prioritize certainty and minimize risk. While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob,  I'm running out of time and his offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation."
