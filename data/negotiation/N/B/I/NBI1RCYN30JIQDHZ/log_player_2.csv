"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm proposing a price of $9,500.  It's a steal for something that will bring you so much value! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or secure a better deal elsewhere."
