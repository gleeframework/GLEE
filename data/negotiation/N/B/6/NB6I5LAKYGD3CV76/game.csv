"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make another serious offer. I can do $775,000, which is the highest I can go without going over my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $775,000 is closer to where I need to be. However, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute bottom line. If we can agree on that, I'm happy to finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
