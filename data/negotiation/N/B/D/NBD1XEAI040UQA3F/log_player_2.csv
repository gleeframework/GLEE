You have three options:

You can do better than $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500? This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, you can still do better. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer, potentially getting closer to your target price of $8,000."
