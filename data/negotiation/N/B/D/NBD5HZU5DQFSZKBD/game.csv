"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Alice,3,
