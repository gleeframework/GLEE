Alice's offer is way above your budget. You need to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $120 is still too high for your budget. It's better to buy the product from John for $80."
