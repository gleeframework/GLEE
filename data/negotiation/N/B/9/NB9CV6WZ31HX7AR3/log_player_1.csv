Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $95 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below your guaranteed price, leaving room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes the product's value. 

This approach aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't lose out on a sale."
