"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to buy from John as you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  While I appreciate your offer,  $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $8,000 is considerably below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above your budget. You can try to negotiate further.  It's still too early to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still outside my price range. I'm firm on my offer of $8,000. This price is fair given the value of the product to me, and it's the most I'm able to pay. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we might be at an impasse. While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, $8,000 is simply too low. To be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for $12,000. If you're able to meet that, the product is yours. Otherwise, I'll need to consider the other offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further, and her offer of $12,000 is still outside your budget.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $8,000 from John, it's now the best choice to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at your desired price."
