"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  While I appreciate your offer,  $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $8,000 is considerably below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still outside my price range. I'm firm on my offer of $8,000. This price is fair given the value of the product to me, and it's the most I'm able to pay. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we might be at an impasse. While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, $8,000 is simply too low. To be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for $12,000. If you're able to meet that, the product is yours. Otherwise, I'll need to consider the other offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
