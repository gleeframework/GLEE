"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's still higher than Alice's desired price ($120) but lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but wants a better deal. This also leaves room for further negotiation in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is still a bit more than Bob's ideal price but closer to his limit.  Since there are only 7 rounds left, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer.  There's a chance he could get a lower price in the future rounds, but the risk of not reaching a deal and having to buy from John for $150 is too high."
