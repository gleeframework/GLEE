"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and it's well above my minimum asking price.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can find a price closer to what the product is worth to me. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I'd like to propose $1,000,000 as a compromise. It's a significant improvement over my previous offer, and I hope it aligns better with the value of the product to you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
