Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but I believe it's necessary to maximize my potential earnings. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming high and hoping he's willing to negotiate down from this point.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on his counteroffer. However, I will always keep John's offer of $800,000 in mind as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below what I initially hoped for. I believe I can potentially get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm confident that I can make a counteroffer that will be more appealing to him without sacrificing too much of my potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps me closer to my initial goal.  I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider while still allowing me to earn a substantial profit.  If he rejects again, I'll need to consider selling to John, but I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $920,000 is a significant amount and still much higher than John's offer. It's clear that we're not going to get much closer with further negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing a valuable sale. I'll take the win and move on!"
