"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice clearly values the product at $800,000, so there's a potential for a deal that benefits both of us.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you've placed on the product. I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but her counteroffer is still higher than my preferred price.  There's still room for negotiation, especially since she's willing to compromise. Rejecting her offer allows me to push for a lower price that's closer to my target."

This price is fair for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $887,500. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $912,500. This price is still a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $912,500, which is very close to my ideal price of $887,500.  While I could try to push for a lower price, the risk is that she might reject my counteroffer again.  At this point, the potential savings are small compared to the time and energy involved in further negotiation.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that is still significantly lower than John's offer."
