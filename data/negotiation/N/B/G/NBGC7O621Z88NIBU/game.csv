"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if you can meet me in the middle.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's fair to me.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of offering $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my means. Can you consider my offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a little further and offer the product for $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
