Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he might get a deal. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message implies a higher value by using phrases like ""significant amount"" and ""willing to part with it.""
* **Leaving Room for John:** Offering it at $20,000 leaves a $5,000 buffer. Even if Bob negotiates down, you have a good chance of getting more than John's offer.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
