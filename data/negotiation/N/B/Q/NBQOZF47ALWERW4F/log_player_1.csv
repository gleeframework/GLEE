"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation. It is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than your minimum. This allows for potential concessions in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to consider, it would be a massive loss for me. I need to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $700,000. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $700,000 is still too low for me. I need to push for a higher price and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to meet my needs while ensuring you get a valuable product at a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
