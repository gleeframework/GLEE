"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is close to my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Showing interest in Bob:** I'm explicitly mentioning that I think the product is of value to Bob. This helps build rapport and sets the stage for a potentially mutually beneficial deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to respond and engage in a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $100 is my minimum acceptable value, I'm confident I can get a better deal.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate with Bob.  I'm willing to consider his offer, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Exploring other options:** I'm not immediately jumping to sell to John. I want to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $115?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm increasing Bob's offer by $15, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not giving in too quickly.
* **Focusing on a win-win:** My message emphasizes that this price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you value the product, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $107 is getting close to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Time is of the essence:** We're already in Round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and being stuck with the lower price from John.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though I'm accepting a lower price this time, I've built a relationship with Bob and might be able to negotiate a better price in future deals if he's interested in similar products."
