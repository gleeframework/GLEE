"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This ""anchors"" the negotiation high.  Even if Bob pushes back significantly, it leaves room to negotiate down while still potentially exceeding my minimum.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher than the asking price by mentioning ""potential.""
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price signals I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. I have room to negotiate and am willing to see if I can bring him closer to my target range.  John's offer provides a good safety net, but I'm not ready to walk away from potentially getting a better deal from Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate you recognizing the potential of this product. While your offer is reasonable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,900,000. This reflects the true value and the unique advantages it offers.  Are you open to exploring options around this figure?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial decrease from my initial offer, signaling flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob somewhere in the middle. However, I'm still aiming significantly higher than his offer and slightly above my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's ""true value"" to justify the higher price and shift the conversation away from just Bob's budget.
* **Open to Discussion:** The phrasing ""exploring options around this figure"" suggests some room for negotiation without committing to a specific price drop. This keeps the door open for Bob to make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I acknowledge the value you're placing on this product, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. This price reflects the potential of the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a profitable deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
