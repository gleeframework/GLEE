"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay up to $800,000. This offer is a starting point for negotiation and shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He can still get the product for $800,000 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of paying as little as possible.  He's increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's serious about buying but still firmly below Alice's offer. He hopes this will entice Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is not budging much in her price. At this point, Bob has already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and his counteroffers are getting closer to his maximum. Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he has a guaranteed deal with John for a lower price. Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John."
