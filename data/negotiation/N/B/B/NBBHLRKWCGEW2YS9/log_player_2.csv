Alice is moving closer to my price, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll try to negotiate a bit more before considering John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and go with $1,175,000? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

I'm still not willing to pay $1,400,000.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but if she won't budge, I'll probably buy from John in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,250,000. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,450,000, which is still a good deal for you, but also allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

Alice is still too high for me.  At this point, I'm better off just buying from John.  I've only got a few rounds left, and I'm not sure if I can get Alice down to a price I'm comfortable with."
