"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100. If that works for you, let's make a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here of you not valuing this product fairly. My walk-away price is $120.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it.",120.0,Alice,5,
