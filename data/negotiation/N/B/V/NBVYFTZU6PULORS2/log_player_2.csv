"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her value for the product, you know you can get it for $100 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the door to getting the best possible price."
