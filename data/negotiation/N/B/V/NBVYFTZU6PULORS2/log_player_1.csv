Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows her minimum acceptable price is $150 (her value) but aims to get as close to Bob's maximum ($200) as possible.  Starting at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning she has other options (""willing to offer it to *you*""), Alice subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act. 
* **Leaving Room for Acceptance:** The $140 price point is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) but is still attractive enough that he might consider it a fair deal."
