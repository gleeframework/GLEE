"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to purchase a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but if that fails, he can always go with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a reasonable compromise.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $16,000 is still more than he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate further. If Alice refuses to budge, he can always buy the product from John for $12,000."

I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $14,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $16,500 for the product. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $16,500, which is still above Bob's budget.  It's better to accept a sure thing from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice that might result in an even higher price."
