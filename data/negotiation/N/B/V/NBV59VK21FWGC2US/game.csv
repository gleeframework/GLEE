"I have a unique opportunity for you to purchase a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a reasonable compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on your last offer.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $14,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $16,500 for the product. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",16500.0,Alice,5,
