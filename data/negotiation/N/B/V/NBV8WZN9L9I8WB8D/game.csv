"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is a fair price, it's a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my value. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I think this is a fair compromise and would be a great price for both of us.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm very close to making a deal with you.  I'm going to make one final offer of $10,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it's fair to me.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can finalize the sale. ",10000.0,Alice,5,
