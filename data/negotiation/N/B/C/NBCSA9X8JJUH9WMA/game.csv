"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer,  $9,000 is not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  how about $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is still a little high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  Let's try $10,000.  This is a fair compromise that still allows me to get a good price for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
