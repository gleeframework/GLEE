Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to increase the chances of Bob accepting the initial offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm aware Bob might counteroffer, so I'm leaving enough space for negotiation without jeopardizing my goal of maximizing profit.
* **John as a backup:**  I have John as a fallback option, giving me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Even though Bob increased his offer, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's room to push for a higher price. 
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Open to compromise:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $875,000, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $860,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value and the price I'm willing to pay. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway again.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, his offer of $860,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  We're still in the negotiation phase. There's a possibility of Bob increasing his offer further.
* **John is a safe backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 allows me to hold out for a better offer from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $860,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop my price to $870,000. This is my final offer. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 870000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm signaling this is my final offer to pressure Bob into accepting. 
* **Meeting halfway (again):** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining my position.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob about the product's value to justify the price.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm using language like ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency. 

This counteroffer strikes a balance between being firm on my minimum price and showing flexibility. It's also a good strategy to try and push Bob to make a decision, as he may not want to risk losing the deal altogether."
