"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than both your maximum price and Alice's valuation. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's valuation of $80. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation environment. We provide a reason for the counteroffer without revealing our absolute maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for such a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice moved down from her initial offer, but $95 is still higher than our target price. 
* **Gradual Concessions:** We want to avoid accepting too quickly and potentially leaving money on the table. By continuing to negotiate, we signal that we're looking for a price closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a great product, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a common negotiation tactic and implies a willingness to compromise.
* **Targeting the Sweet Spot:**  We're aiming for a price that's a good deal for us (below our $120 maximum) while still likely being acceptable to Alice (above her $80 valuation).
* **Maintaining Communication:** We keep the conversation going, showing Alice we're serious about purchasing the product but want to find the right price."
