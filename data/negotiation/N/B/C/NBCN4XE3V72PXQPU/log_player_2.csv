"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $12,000. I'm confident it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for less from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his limit. He's better off going with John's offer for $8,000."
