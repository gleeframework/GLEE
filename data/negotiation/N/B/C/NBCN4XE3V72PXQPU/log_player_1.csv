Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $12,000. I'm confident it's a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and benefits"" aims to frame the price in a positive light.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone keeps the conversation open for Bob to respond, either with a counteroffer or by accepting.
 
This strategy balances ambition with a willingness to negotiate, increasing the chances of a favorable outcome for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, accepting it would mean a significant loss ($2,000). It's too early to settle.  Since we have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, we have room to negotiate with Bob.  We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We've moved closer to Bob's price point, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  By reiterating the product's value, we're subtly reminding Bob of what he'd be missing at a lower price. 
* **Strong Position:** We're offering a price we know we can get elsewhere (from John). This gives us a strong bargaining position. 

By aiming for $10,000, we maximize our potential profit while still leaving Bob some room to negotiate further if he's truly motivated."
