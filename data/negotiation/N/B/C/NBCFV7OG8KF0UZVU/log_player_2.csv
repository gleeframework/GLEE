"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I've priced it at $1,300,000 to reflect its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth significantly more than your offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can still potentially negotiate a better price, as she indicated this was her final offer but she did lower the price from the previous round.  It's worth seeing if you can get her closer to your $1,000,000 target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still beyond my budget. I'm confident that $1,100,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm ready to make the purchase at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm selling.  I can't go any lower than $1,150,000.  This is my absolute final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her ""absolute final offer"". While you could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance she won't budge further. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John at $1,000,000.  You'll save $150,000 compared to Alice's offer and avoid any further negotiation."
