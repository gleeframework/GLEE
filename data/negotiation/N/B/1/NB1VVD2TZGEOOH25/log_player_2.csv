"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget of $12,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with his absolute maximum price. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation.  He's letting Alice know he's serious about getting the product, but he's also not willing to go higher than his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He has room to negotiate further, and he's still better off than buying from John at this point.  By continuing the negotiation, Bob might get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing Alice he's willing to compromise.  $13,000 is still within his budget and represents a significant decrease from Alice's last offer.  This move keeps the negotiation moving forward and might encourage Alice to make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still too high for Bob. It's a slight decrease from her previous offer but still above his budget. He should reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and get a better price. The negotiation process has demonstrated that Alice is willing to lower her price, so continuing to counteroffer could lead to a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again increasing his offer, but this time by a larger margin, demonstrating a willingness to be more flexible. This move is calculated to entice Alice towards a compromise.  It's important to note that Bob is still within his budget, and he's trying to find a middle ground with Alice's offers.  This counteroffer signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't budge beyond his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,800 is still too high for Bob, and he's only got 3 rounds left. At this point, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to budge much further.  He's already made significant compromises and the risk of continuing the negotiation is that he'll run out of time and be forced to accept a price he's not comfortable with.  It's better to cut his losses and buy the product from John at his price of $12,000.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the potential of a worse outcome with Alice."
