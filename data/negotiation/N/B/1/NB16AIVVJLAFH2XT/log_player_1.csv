Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm suggesting the product is a ""great deal"" without going into specifics about its features or benefits. This creates curiosity and encourages Bob to inquire further. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to open up the conversation and allow Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will:

* **If he accepts:** I'll close the deal and sell him the product at $150.
* **If he rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I might accept a lower price if it's close to my minimum acceptable price or counteroffer with a slightly lower price. 
* **If negotiations become too lengthy or I feel I can't get a better price:** I'll stop the negotiation and sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $100? I'm looking forward to hearing your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting it would result in a loss for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a middle ground. I will use the following strategy:

* **Counteroffer:** I will offer a price of $130, which is still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Rationale:** I will explain that $130 is a fair price considering the value of the product and that I am willing to negotiate further to reach an agreement. 

**Goals:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to earn as much as possible for the product.
* **Keep Bob Interested:** I want to maintain a positive relationship with Bob and keep him engaged in the negotiation. 
* **Avoid Selling to John:** Selling to John for $120 is my last resort and I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob if possible."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While $100 is lower than my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $130? It's a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to consider $120 as the price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer will still allow me to meet my financial goal and avoid selling to John.  There's no benefit in continuing negotiations further as I've already reached my minimum, and any further counteroffers might lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away completely. 

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
