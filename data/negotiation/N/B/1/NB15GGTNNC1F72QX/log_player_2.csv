"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It signals that I'm serious about buying but need a much lower price. 
* **Polite and Positive:** The message maintains a respectful and optimistic tone. It acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest in the product.

This strategy aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate a price closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, the product's value to me is higher than $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $10,000 is still too high. I know I have a backup option with John at $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will move closer to a price I find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:**  I'm making it clear that $8,000 is my final offer. This is a strong negotiating tactic, especially since I have a backup option at that price. 
* **Justification:** I'm giving a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing it's the maximum I'm willing to spend.

By now, Alice should understand I'm serious and have a limit. This puts the ball in her court to decide if she wants to make a deal or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking we could be even closer to the middle. How about $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go down to $8,000.  She's holding firm at a price point that's still significantly higher than my backup plan with John. Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially miss out on both deals, it's in my best interest to secure the product from John at the price I'm comfortable with."
