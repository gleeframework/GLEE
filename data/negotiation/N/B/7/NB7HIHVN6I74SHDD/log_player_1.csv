"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $15,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
