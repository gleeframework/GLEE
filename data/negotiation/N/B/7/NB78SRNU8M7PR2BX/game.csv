"Alice, your offer is much higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product, given my research and its market value. Let's work together to find a price that's fair to both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $12000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $12000 is still outside of my budget. I'm sticking with my original offer of $8000, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the product's market value. Let's make this deal happen!",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to go with another seller. Let's close this deal, and avoid any further delays.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $8000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9500. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
