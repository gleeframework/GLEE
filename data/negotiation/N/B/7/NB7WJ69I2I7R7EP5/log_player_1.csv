{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to maximize potential profit. However, it's not so high that it's immediately unreasonable, allowing for negotiation. The message is friendly and encourages a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum value.  I'll counter Bob's offer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's only $500 less than my counteroffer and above my minimum of $10,000.  It's a good deal for me, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round."
