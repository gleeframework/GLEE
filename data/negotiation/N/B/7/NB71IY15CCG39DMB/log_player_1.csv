"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $140 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you be willing to consider $125? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price. I still believe the product is worth more than $125 to Bob, given that it's worth $150 to him.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $132?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $132 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my initial counter-offer of $132.  While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price of $140, I think it's a good deal for both of us, and there's a good chance he might reject any further counter-offers.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit and keeps me from losing money by selling to John."
