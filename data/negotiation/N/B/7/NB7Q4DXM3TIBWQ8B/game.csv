"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Can you consider it?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle.
