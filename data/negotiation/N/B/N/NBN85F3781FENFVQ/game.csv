"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value and my initial asking price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. This price is fair to both of us, and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,
