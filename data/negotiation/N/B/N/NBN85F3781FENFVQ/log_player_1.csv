Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable asset.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. This price is fair to both of us, and would allow us to close the deal quickly.
