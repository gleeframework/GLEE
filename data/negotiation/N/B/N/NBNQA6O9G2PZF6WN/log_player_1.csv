Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a premium. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more willing to pay a higher price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes I don't know Bob's financial limits or how much he might be willing to pay. 
* If I had more information about Bob, I could tailor my offer more effectively."
