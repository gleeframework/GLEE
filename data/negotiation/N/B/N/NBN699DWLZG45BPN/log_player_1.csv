Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  We want to aim for a price significantly higher than this while staying below his maximum.
* **John as a Guarantee:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000. This means we don't have to go below that price.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** The offer of $1,350,000  leaves a good profit margin for Alice while still potentially being attractive to Bob. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") and exclusivity, potentially making the offer more appealing. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,350,000. He might try to negotiate, or he might outright reject the offer. Alice needs to be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet her price expectations."
