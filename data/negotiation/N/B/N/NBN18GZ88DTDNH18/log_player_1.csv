Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle, and you can always come down a bit while still staying above your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:** A higher initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects it, you haven't lost anything. 
 
Let me know what Bob says!"
