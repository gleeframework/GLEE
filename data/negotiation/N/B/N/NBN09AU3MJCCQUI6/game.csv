"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $100. I'm willing to go up to $110, but I think it's a bit more valuable than that. How about we meet in the middle of my previous offer and your offer at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I think the product is worth a premium, and I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let's talk turkey!",110.0,Alice,9,
