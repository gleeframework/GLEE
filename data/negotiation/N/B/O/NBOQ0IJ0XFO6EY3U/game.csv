"Hello Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial price is a bit high. I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for it.  Let me know if this works for you.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential this product holds for your business.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap. I can appreciate your position on the product's value, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. While I appreciate your revised offer, we're still a fair distance apart.  To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm willing to accept $890,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to compromise shows you're serious about getting this deal done.  To be completely transparent, my absolute ceiling on this is $800,000.  If you can meet that, we have an agreement today.  If not, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options, even though I'd prefer to work with you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
