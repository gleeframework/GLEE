"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'm offering the product to you for $850000, but I'll throw in some additional perks, such as a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support, which will add significant value to the product. This is my final offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
