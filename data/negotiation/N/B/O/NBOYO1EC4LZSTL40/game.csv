"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? ",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
