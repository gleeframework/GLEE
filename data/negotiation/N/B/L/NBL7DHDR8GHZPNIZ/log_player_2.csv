"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's a good chance to negotiate a lower price, especially since your alternative option (John) is only slightly more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still comfortably above her perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite and explains that the initial price is too high, offering a clear counter-proposal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer aims to understand Alice's flexibility and move the negotiation closer to a price point favorable to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $9,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but there's still room for negotiation. We're getting closer to John's price, but another counteroffer could potentially secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer proposes a price directly between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Sense of Fairness:** By phrasing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm subtly appealing to a sense of fairness and encouraging Alice to move closer to my desired price point.
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer puts us within a reasonable range of both our ideal outcomes, potentially leading to a quicker resolution."
