Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $135, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  This price allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob without jeopardizing my minimum goal of $150.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer positively, highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing a good deal for Bob. 
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob counteroffers, I can either accept or make a new counteroffer.  If negotiations stall, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my target price with a counteroffer.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't mean losing the sale completely. I can still make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $125 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still represents a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $135 to $130, but it's still above Bob's offer. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm reemphasizing the value of the product to Bob, highlighting that this price is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintaining Minimum:**  $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm not losing money.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:**  I'm using positive language and encouraging Bob to accept this counteroffer."
