"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it has immense potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product to me. While $950,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to secure a more advantageous deal. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This price reflects a significant discount from my maximum budget and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable accepting $800,000 for the product. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also being a significant discount from its true value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, which represents a significant investment for me and a fair compromise. This price recognizes the value of the product while still providing you with a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This price is closer to the product's true value and still represents a significant discount from its worth to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal and avoid going any further.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a slightly lower price, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,015,000 for the product. This price still reflects its value to you and is a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to maintain a certain level of profit. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,015,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to pay $985,000 for the product. This offer reflects a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while still allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm hoping this is the final offer that we can agree on.",985000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to maintain a certain level of profit. I'm offering the product to you for $1,012,500.
