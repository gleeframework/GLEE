"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'd love to offer you. I'm asking for $15,000, which reflects its high quality and value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have 8 rounds left, and John is a backup option at $12,000. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this work. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I have 6 rounds left and John is still an option for $12,000.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a one-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. We're getting closer, but with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory price is too high.  John is a guaranteed sale at $12,000, which is more than worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
