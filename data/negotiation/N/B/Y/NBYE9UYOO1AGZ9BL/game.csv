"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1500000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let's try to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm going to counter with $1100000. This is my final offer, as it's the lowest I can go while still feeling comfortable with the deal. Let's close this now.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
