"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that is currently priced at $950000. This product is worth significantly more than what I'm offering, but I believe its value to you could be even higher.  Let me know your thoughts and we can discuss further. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is eager to purchase it for $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
