# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can save up to $1,000 by getting a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to work with me. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise, as it saves you $1,250 compared to buying from John.  It's also a decent profit margin for Alice."
