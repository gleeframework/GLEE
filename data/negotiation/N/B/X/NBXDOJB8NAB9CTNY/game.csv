"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and offer $8,250? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate.",8250.0,Bob,4,
