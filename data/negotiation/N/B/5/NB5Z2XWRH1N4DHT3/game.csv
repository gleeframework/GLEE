,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $118. It's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",118.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $118 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go to $112.  This is a fair price, and it will allow me to buy the product without stretching my budget too thin.",112.0,Bob,6,
