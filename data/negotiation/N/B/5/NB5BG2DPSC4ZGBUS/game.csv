"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to go down to 10800, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value this product brings.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10800 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $10200, I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10200.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we compromise at 10500?",10500.0,Alice,7,
