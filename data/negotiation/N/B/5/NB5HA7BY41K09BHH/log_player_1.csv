Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to push for a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great price for the product, considering its value.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,750 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,875? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being a good deal for you.  Let's try to close this deal,  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.
