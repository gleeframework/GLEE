Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $1,200,000 (John's offer).
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he's willing to pay beyond his $1,500,000 valuation. 
* There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, having John as a backup buyer mitigates this risk."
