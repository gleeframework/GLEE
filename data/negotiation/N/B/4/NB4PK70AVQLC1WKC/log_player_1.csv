Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that Bob values the product at $1,500,000, making it a potentially attractive price for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,350,000. This counteroffer leaves some room for negotiation but also ensures I'm not selling too far below what I believe the product is worth."
