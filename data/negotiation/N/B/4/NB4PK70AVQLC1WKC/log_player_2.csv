"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than what John is selling it for, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price.  There's a chance Alice might accept a lower price, saving Bob money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $1,350,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's valuation of $1,200,000. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while demonstrating Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still lower than what John is selling it for ($1,500,000).  It's a good deal for Bob, saving him $100,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always the possibility of negotiating further,  accepting the offer guarantees a purchase at a favorable price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers."
