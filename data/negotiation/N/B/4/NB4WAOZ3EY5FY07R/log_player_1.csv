Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, the product's value justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $1,200,000 is the highest I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000) and John's offer. It makes sense to accept now rather than risk losing him in further rounds."
