"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000, which reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant and goes beyond the $1,000,000 mark. I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,450,000 to find a middle ground.  I believe this offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial feedback.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable offering $1,150,000,  which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your willingness to work towards a deal.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,300,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding an agreement that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
