"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,000. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to find a solution that benefits us both.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
