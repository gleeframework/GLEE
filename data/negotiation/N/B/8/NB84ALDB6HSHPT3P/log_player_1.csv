Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While I could push for more, Bob landing at my minimum acceptable price is a good outcome. It's better to secure the deal now than risk him lowering his offer or walking away in future rounds."
