It's always worth trying to negotiate. Since you're not sure how much Alice needs to sell the product for, there's a chance you can get it for less."

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a bold move, but it might be enough to get her attention and start the negotiation process."

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can get a lower price."
