(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,270,000 is only $70,000 more than John's price.  Considering the limited rounds remaining, it's a good compromise. Bob can save some money compared to John while still securing the product. There's a higher risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers, potentially leading to a worse outcome."
