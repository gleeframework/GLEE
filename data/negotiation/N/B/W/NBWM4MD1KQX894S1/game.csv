"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1050000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price is still fair to both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1075000 for the product. This is a good compromise that considers both our needs. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not making much progress here.  $1075000 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1087500. This is a final offer from me, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
