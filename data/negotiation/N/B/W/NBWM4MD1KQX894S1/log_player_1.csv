Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1075000 for the product. This is a good compromise that considers both our needs. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.
