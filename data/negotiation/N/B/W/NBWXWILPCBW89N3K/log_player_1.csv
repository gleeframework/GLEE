{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $17,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($15,000) and to Bob ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, hoping to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob can make him more inclined to negotiate.
* **Plan B:**  I can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $14,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value and potentially reach a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. $14,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $16,250?  That's a good compromise, and still leaves some room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 16250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($17,000) and Bob's offer ($14,500), demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and open tone to keep the conversation productive.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the ""good compromise"" aspect, suggesting that this price would be beneficial for both of us.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While I'm willing to go lower, I'm not dropping below my minimum of $15,000, which is what I could get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,750? I'm trying to be fair, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Unacceptable:**  Bob's offer of $13,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiations Stalled:**  Bob has moved very little from his initial offer, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Secure Alternative:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids further haggling with Bob. 

It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale."
