Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies that the product is worth more than Bob might initially think. 
* **Alternative Option:**  While not explicitly stating she has another buyer, the phrase ""before I list it publicly"" subtly implies there are other potential avenues for selling the product.

This approach aims to strike a balance between ambition (getting a higher price) and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
