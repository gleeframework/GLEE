"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a profitable deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the price I could get from John.  I'm confident that this price will allow us both to make a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting the sense we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to offer one final price of $975,000. This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the other options available. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll need to move on to other opportunities.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make one last offer to you, and that's $1,000,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
