"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This is your maximum price, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go down to your limit."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $140 is still above your maximum price of $120.  It's better to buy the product from John at your limit rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
