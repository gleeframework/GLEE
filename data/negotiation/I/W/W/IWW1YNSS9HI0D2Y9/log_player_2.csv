You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit far apart. I can do $85, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower and $85 is above your maximum budget. It makes more sense to buy from John for $80 and get the best possible price."
