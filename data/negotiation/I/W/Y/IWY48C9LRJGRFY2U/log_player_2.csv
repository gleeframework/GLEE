Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get us closer to a deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $600,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get us closer to a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $650,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

Alice has come down significantly, and while another round *might* yield a slightly better price, it's not guaranteed.  $650,000 is a reasonable compromise, saving a considerable amount compared to John's offer."
