"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you. I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is less than John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's closer to Alice's minimum while still saving money.  He's aiming for a middle ground in this first counteroffer,  showing he's serious about buying but wants a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. He can potentially get a lower price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and go with $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to negotiate, offering a price that's slightly higher than his previous offer but still lower than Alice's current offer.  He's showing flexibility and trying to reach a compromise that both parties can agree on."
