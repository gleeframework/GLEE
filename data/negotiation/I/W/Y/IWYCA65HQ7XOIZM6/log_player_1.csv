{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You don't know Bob's exact valuation, but you know it's worth $1,000,000 to him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above Bob's valuation.
* **Backup Option (John):** You have a strong backup option with John, ensuring you won't settle for less than $1,200,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while considering the possibility of negotiation and the security of a guaranteed sale."
