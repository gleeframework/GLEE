"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering this to me, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  That's a fair price considering my maximum is $8,000, and it's still above your value of $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal, considering its value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my range. John has offered me the same product for $8,000, so I'm really trying to stay close to that. I'm willing to offer you $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to stay close to John's offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering its value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
