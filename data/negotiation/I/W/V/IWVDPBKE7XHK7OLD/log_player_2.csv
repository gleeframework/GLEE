"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you value the product at $80, $50 is a good starting point. Let's see if we can get it even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
``` 
Let's start by offering $40, which is significantly less than Alice's offer but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Alice has come down to $45, which is closer to my counteroffer and still a good deal. I'll accept the offer and save some money."
