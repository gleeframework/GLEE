Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, I want to start negotiations with Bob closer to that figure. 
* **Justification for value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters."
