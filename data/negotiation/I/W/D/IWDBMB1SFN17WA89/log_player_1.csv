"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a fairer price would be $1,800,000. This takes into account the potential benefits it holds for your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

While closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price before accepting Bob's offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me to accept. How about we settle on $1,600,000? I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob is unlikely to move significantly closer to my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
