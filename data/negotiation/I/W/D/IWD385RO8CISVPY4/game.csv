"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1200000, which is a fair reflection of its worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also being fair to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $980000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm counteroffering $975000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $985000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering $985000. If this isn't acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",985000.0,Alice,7,
