Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $100 as possible, but I need to offer Bob a price that he might accept. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer it at a price lower than his valuation but higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $100 gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob.

By offering the product at $95, I'm giving Bob a chance to gain $5 in perceived value while still aiming for a higher profit than my guaranteed sale to John."
