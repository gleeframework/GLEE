Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum than Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob, emphasizing the ""great deal"" and the product's value.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm encouraging Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while leaving room for compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  I need to maintain leverage and see if I can push Bob higher. 

I'm choosing to reject his offer for now and make a counteroffer in the next round. This will allow me to gauge Bob's flexibility and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining some leverage.
* **Positive Framing:** Again, I'm focusing on the mutual benefits of the deal. I emphasize ""fair price"" and the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, allowing Bob to respond with a counteroffer or accept my proposal. 

By offering a counter-proposal that is closer to my ideal price, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward while staying within a range that still benefits me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,250 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000. I'm not desperate to sell and have the option of selling to John for a much higher price. Therefore, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate. I believe I can still push for a higher price with more rounds of negotiation."

* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""uniqueness"" and ""investment value"" of the product to justify the price point. I also highlight my commitment to finding a ""common ground,"" showcasing flexibility.

Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($10,625) and Bob's offer ($10,400). This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize ""fair price"" and ""good deal for both of us"" to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer.
