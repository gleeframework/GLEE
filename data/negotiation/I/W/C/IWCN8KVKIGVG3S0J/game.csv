"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $13,000. Let me know if that works for you!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I like where we're headed, Bob, but I'm still a bit short on my target price. I can do $13,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. Let me know if it works for you!",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $14,000. I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $14,000. I'll do $13,750. Let's see if we can make a deal!",13750.0,Alice,7,
