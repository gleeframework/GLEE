"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. This is a common tactic to maximize potential profit. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer as a positive opportunity for Bob, highlighting its value. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Note:** This is just a starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. I also have the option to go with John's offer if negotiations with Bob don't seem promising."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, but still above my minimum threshold. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer gives me more leverage and allows me to try and meet in the middle.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John immediately would secure a safe profit, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price with further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In round 3, I'll propose a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial price but still above Bob's offer. This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while remaining competitive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $14,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, reflecting the value this product holds.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by dropping my price from $18,000 to $16,000. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price point.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and open to further discussion.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or take the safe option of selling to John.  I'll aim to stay flexible and adapt my strategy based on the remaining rounds and Bob's actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $15500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum threshold of $12,000. This is a tempting offer, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  We are already in the fourth round, and the gap between our prices is narrowing.  Rejecting this offer maintains my leverage and allows me to make one final counteroffer in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John would guarantee a safe profit, I'm confident I can get closer to $16,000 with a final counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

In round 5, I'll make a final counteroffer at $15,750. This is a small compromise, but it should hopefully convince Bob to accept the deal. If he doesn't, I'll then consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards a deal. Let's split the difference: I'm proposing $15,750. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my last chance to secure a better price with Bob.  I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my initial asking price, but also attractive to Bob.
* **Compromise and Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""split the difference"" aspect to present the offer as a fair and mutually beneficial solution.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm conveying a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he accepts, I've successfully negotiated a good price. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to sell to John or make one final counteroffer in round 6."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $15200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** We are in round 6, and with only 4 rounds remaining, there's not much time to negotiate further.
* **Minimal Gain:** Bob's offer of $15,200 is only $200 higher than John's offer of $12,000.  The potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of further negotiation.
* **Risk of No Deal:** There's a significant risk that we won't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. 

**Decision:** Selling to John guarantees a safe profit of $12,000. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, securing a deal now is the more prudent choice."
