Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility on price. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
