# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can start by offering a lower price and see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  What do you think?

You have three options:

You're still closer to your goal price of $100.  Continue to negotiate, you might be able to get Alice down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $108. It's a fair compromise, and it would save us both some time."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $108 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $109?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109

You've come close to your target price, but Alice is still unwilling to budge much further. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially going back and forth multiple times.  John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which is your target, so it's the best option at this point."
