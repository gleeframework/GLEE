"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $108. It's a fair compromise, and it would save us both some time.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $108 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $109?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
