"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this revised offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
