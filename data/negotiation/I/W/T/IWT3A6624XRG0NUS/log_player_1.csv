Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a bargain price of $119. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price and well worth considering."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $120 as possible, but I also want to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is a price that still gives me a significant profit margin while being just below my guaranteed sale price to John. This creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.
* **Positive Messaging:**  Framing the offer as a ""bargain"" and a ""steal"" encourages Bob to see the value in the product and potentially overlook the fact that it's slightly above his perceived value."
