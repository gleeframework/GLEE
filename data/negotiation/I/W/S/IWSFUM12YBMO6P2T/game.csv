,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a little too high for me.  How about $11,000?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller step down and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
