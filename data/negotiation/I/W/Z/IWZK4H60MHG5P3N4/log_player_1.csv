Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum:** I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, so I shouldn't sell for anything less.
* **Starting high:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Potential profit:** By offering at $170, there's a chance Bob might accept, netting a $20 profit over selling to John.  

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I don't know how much Bob values the product. If I knew he valued it at $80, I might try a different approach."
