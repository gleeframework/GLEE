"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a higher price before potentially selling to John for the baseline value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sell at such a loss. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first round, showing willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a good price for me, and it might be appealing enough for Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to continue negotiating with him, as there's still room for a better price, and I want to avoid selling to John for the baseline value if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm further lowering my price to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price above the $1,000,000 baseline. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my baseline, but not quite there.  While I could continue to negotiate, we only have a few rounds left.  I'd rather not risk losing out on a sale entirely, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with, and it's better than risking a lower price with Bob in the limited remaining rounds."
