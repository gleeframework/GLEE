Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm really interested in this product, though.  How about we start at $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $142.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it's within my budget.",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $142.50 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already come down a significant amount from my initial offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $150? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",150.0,Alice,5,
