"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is far above your maximum budget of $120.  It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm really interested in this product, though.  How about we start at $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $155 is still outside of your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $142.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 142.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $142.50 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already come down a significant amount from my initial offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $150? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go below $150, which is still above your budget.  You've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems like further negotiation is unlikely to get you a better price. Buying from John at $120 is the most financially sensible choice at this point."
