"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,500.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $8,500. Considering our initial conversation, I'd like to make a revised offer of $9,800. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, while also showing my willingness to meet you halfway.",9800.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still believe the product's value is closer to $10,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to make a revised offer of $9,400. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway to find a deal that works for both of us.",9400.0,Alice,5,
