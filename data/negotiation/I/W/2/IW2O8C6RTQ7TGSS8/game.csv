"Alice,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,800,000 was a bit ambitious. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that still reflects the inherent value of this product.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,650,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This price is a fair compromise for both of us and leaves some room for negotiation.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
