# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. While I would like to accommodate your budget, I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. Therefore, I propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. This still allows us to retain a reasonable profit margin while remaining competitive in the market. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.
