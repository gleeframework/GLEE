"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11000? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about $10800? It's still a great deal for you, and it brings me closer to my target price.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10800.  That's a good price, but I'm still a little bit over budget.  How about we split the difference again and go with $10650?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to our desired price. ",10650.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10650, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we do $10750? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a small increase from your latest offer. Plus, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",10750.0,Alice,7,
