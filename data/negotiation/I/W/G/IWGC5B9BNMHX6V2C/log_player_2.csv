"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be happy to buy it for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:**  Bob is aiming for a lower price, but not drastically lower. This keeps the negotiations moving forward.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer and explains Bob's desire for a lower price. It ends with a question to encourage Alice to respond. 
* **Price:** $9,000 is a reasonable counteroffer. It's closer to Alice's value but still offers Bob a good deal."
