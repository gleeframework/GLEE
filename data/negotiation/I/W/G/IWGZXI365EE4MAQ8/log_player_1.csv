Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving and generating significant revenue. I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize profit. Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000, she should aim for a price significantly higher than her minimum ($800,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves a significant profit margin for Alice while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning a limited-time offer and other interested parties, Alice creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
