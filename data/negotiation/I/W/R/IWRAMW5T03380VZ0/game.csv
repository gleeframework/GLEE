"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  I'll offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a considerable reduction from my initial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need a price that works for me.  How about $950,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while respecting the budget I need to work within.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not a reasonable price.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product and my need to secure a reasonable price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
