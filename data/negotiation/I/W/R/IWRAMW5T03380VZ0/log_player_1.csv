Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  I will counter with a higher price, hoping to get closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  I'll offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a considerable reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need a price that works for me.  How about $950,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while respecting the budget I need to work within. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not a reasonable price.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product and my need to secure a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
