"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but $990,000 is still too far from my target.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can offer right now.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
