Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $8,000, showing you're willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's not unreasonable. Since we have a backup offer from John, we can afford to be a bit more assertive.  Let's try a counteroffer to see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

We're going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise - it's lower than our initial offer but still higher than Bob's. We're showing flexibility, but also demonstrating that we're not willing to settle for his lowball price.  We'll see if this strikes a better balance and leads to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While we want to maximize our profit, we also need to factor in the time and effort involved in negotiation. At this point, it's more efficient to sell the product to John for $8,000. This will give us a guaranteed profit and save us from further haggling with Bob."
