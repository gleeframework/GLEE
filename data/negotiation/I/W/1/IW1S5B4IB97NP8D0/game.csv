"I appreciate your willingness to sell, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $950,000 on this deal. This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",950000.0,Alice,3,
