"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make a profit on this deal.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,250,000.  This allows you to acquire a valuable product at a price that's still advantageous for you, while ensuring I can cover my costs.  Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,150,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $1,200,000 for this. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle, and we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're looking to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a better deal. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,6,
