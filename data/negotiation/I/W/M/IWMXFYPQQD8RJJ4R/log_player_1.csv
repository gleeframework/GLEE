Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have considerable interest from other parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but leaves room for profit.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing John will buy at $1,000,000 gives me negotiating power. I can create a sense of urgency and imply I have other interested buyers.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than his valuation. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a high price from Bob and ensuring the sale goes through."
