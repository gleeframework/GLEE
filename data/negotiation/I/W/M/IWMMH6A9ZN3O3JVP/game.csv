"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering you the product for $875,000. This is a fair compromise and I believe it's still a great deal for you.  Let's reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
