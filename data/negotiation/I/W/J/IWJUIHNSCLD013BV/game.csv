"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but I'm still a little ways off from that price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see that you're close to the value you place on the product, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I can see that you're really close to making a decision. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can sell the product to you for $13,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're still not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,7,
