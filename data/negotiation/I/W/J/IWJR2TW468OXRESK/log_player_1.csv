I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get at least $1,500,000 from John if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and it's also significantly below my initial offer of $1,750,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to start with a counteroffer that reflects the product's value to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I could always sell it to John for $1,500,000. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. It's far below my minimum acceptable price, and it's clear he's not willing to meet me halfway. At this point, it's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get a price that covers my minimum requirements."
