Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price close to the maximum Bob is willing to pay. It's also a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation without being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I will counter Bob's offer to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great price considering what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm willing to sell to John for $8,000, which is a more reasonable price.  I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a worse deal."
