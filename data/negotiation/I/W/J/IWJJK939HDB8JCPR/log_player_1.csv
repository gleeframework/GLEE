Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm also confident that the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm not risking losing out completely.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the value of the product. I hope this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John."
