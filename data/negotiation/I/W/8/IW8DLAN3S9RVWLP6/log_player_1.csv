"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price. I also want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell right away. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit than my minimum."
