Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming up, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $105. I was thinking more like $80, which is what I can get from John. Can you meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for more, Bob is getting close to my minimum price and mentioning John indicates he knows his alternative options. Accepting $95 secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
