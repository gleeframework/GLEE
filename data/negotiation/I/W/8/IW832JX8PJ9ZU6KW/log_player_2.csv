Alice's offer is far too high.  It's in my best interest to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

This product has significant inherent value, and I'm confident it will bring you a considerable return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.

While Alice is willing to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to my budget."
