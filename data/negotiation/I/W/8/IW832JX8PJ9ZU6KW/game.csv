"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept.  This product has significant inherent value, and I'm confident it will bring you a considerable return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,550,000? This is a fair compromise that allows me to acquire the product while ensuring you receive a reasonable price. Let's make this deal happen.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
