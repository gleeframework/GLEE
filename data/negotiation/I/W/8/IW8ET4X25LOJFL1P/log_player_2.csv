"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $175 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price of $100. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $100 is your budget, but unfortunately, that's too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $135 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price.  He has a strong bargaining position because he can always walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $117.50? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $117.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $126.25? This would allow us both to come to an agreement and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $126.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $126.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $126.25 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Continue negotiating:**  Bob could continue to negotiate, but there's no guarantee he'll be able to get the price down to his target.  He's already rejected several offers and Alice might become less willing to negotiate further.

2. **Buy from John:** Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100. This is the safest option, as it ensures Bob gets the product within his budget.

Given the limited number of rounds and the risk of further negotiation, Bob should choose to **BuyFromJhon** and secure the product at his target price."
