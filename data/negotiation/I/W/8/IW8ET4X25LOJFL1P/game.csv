"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $100 is your budget, but unfortunately, that's too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $117.50? This would be a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $117.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $126.25? This would allow us both to come to an agreement and move forward.",126.25,Alice,5,
