"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still higher than what Alice is willing to sell for ($8,000).  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved from $12,000 to $11,500, which is a decent compromise.  At this price, I am getting the product for less than what I would pay John, and it's still a good deal considering Alice's minimum price of $8,000.  Further negotiation might save a little more, but the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and needing to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
