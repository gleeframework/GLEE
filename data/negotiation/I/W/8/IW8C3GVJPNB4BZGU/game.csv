"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $900000 is below my initial price, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1050000. This price reflects the significant value of the product and leaves room for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975000. This would allow us both to secure a beneficial deal. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Bob,4,
