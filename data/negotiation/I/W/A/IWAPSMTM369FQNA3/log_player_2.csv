"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired $12,000 limit.  There's potential for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best move in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This offer starts the negotiation by showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Fairness:** $8,500 is a fair starting point for Bob. It's significantly lower than the $12,000 he'd pay John, but still leaves Alice with a profit. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly but firm, setting the tone for a collaborative negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more than that.  How about $9,250?  That's still a good deal for you, and gets me closer to where I need to be. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, $9,250 is still outside of Bob's ideal price range of $12,000 or lower. 
* **Negotiation room:**  There's still room for further negotiation. Bob can try to push the price down even further before considering John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting the offer doesn't risk losing the deal entirely.  If Bob doesn't get a better price from Alice, he can always turn to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:** Bob is slowly moving the price down, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a favorable price.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $9,000 is a fair compromise, getting closer to Alice's desired price while staying within Bob's budget.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** The message highlights how this deal benefits both parties, increasing the chances of Alice accepting."
