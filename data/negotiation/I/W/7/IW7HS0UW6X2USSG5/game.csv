"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it holds. However, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for a price of $800,000? I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. This item is truly one-of-a-kind and its worth is undeniable. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the value you place on the product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. Considering my budget, I propose a price of $1,100,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
