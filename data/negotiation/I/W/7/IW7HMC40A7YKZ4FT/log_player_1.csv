Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the discount, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and your asking price. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
