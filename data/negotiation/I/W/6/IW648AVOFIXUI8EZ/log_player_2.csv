Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution.
