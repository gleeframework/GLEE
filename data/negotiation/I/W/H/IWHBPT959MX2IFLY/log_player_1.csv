Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $1,200,000, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

While I'd love to get closer to my initial target price, I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is going nowhere fast.  $1,250,000 is still a good deal for me and it's likely the best I'll get from Bob. I'm going to accept his offer."
