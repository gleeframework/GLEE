"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds great, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll meet you at $10,750. That's my final offer for now. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm prepared to pay $10,250.  This is my final offer, as I can always buy from John at $10,000.",10250.0,Bob,6,
