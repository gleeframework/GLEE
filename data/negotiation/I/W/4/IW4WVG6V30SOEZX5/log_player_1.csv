{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's truly valuable, and I know it'll be a great asset for you.  My initial price is $11,000, but I'm open to discussion. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500.  I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but also gives us a chance to work together. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiating, $8,000 is too far below my minimum price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This represents a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the new offer! I appreciate your flexibility. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds.  While I'd prefer to sell it to Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price.  I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
