"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $120, as you can get the product for $100 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

Offering $90 is a good starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.  This shows you're serious about buying but are also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

You've shown Alice you're serious about buying, and she's come down a bit.  $95 is a reasonable counteroffer, acknowledging her previous offer but still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still not worth it yet. You're only two rounds away from being able to buy from John, so it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 98} 
```

You're almost at your limit for negotiating with Alice. Offering $98 shows you're willing to meet her halfway, but it's still a better price than buying from John."
