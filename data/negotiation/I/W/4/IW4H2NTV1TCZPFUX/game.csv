"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I understand the value of the product, but I still feel that $90 would be a fair price for me. Could we possibly reach an agreement at that amount?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still holding out for a price of $90, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $105. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",105.0,Alice,5,
