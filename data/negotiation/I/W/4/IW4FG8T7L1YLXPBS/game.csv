"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it'll be even more valuable to you. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $1,100,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,050,000? This gives you a great deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,025,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
