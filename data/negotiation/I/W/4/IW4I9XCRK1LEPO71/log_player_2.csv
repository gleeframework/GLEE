"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is cheaper than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $100 is a reasonable starting point, still offering a profit to Alice while being significantly cheaper than her initial offer and John's price.  This counteroffer creates room for negotiation, allowing Bob to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $115, the product is still significantly cheaper than buying from John, and Bob is likely to save enough to make the purchase worthwhile.  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer or a prolonged negotiation process increases.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal while minimizing risk."
