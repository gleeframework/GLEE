"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
