"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of your budget constraints. While I would like to accommodate your needs, I must maintain a fair pricing structure for all my customers. I am willing to consider a price of $75 for the product. This still allows me to cover costs and ensure the quality of our offerings. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",75.0,Alice,3,
