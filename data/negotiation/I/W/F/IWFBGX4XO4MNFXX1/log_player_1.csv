Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This gives me a $1,000 profit and leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I can still get $8,000 from John. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $8,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it still leaves me with a profit. Hopefully, this will be acceptable to Bob, but if not, I can still sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000, which is still a good deal for me."
