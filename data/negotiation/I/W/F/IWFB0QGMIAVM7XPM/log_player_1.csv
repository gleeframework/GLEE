Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a limited time at $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and how much he values the product.  His response will guide your next move.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. You are not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to his perceived value ($10,000) than your minimum ($12,000). There's room for negotiation. 
* You have the security of John's offer, so there's no need to accept a price below your minimum.
* By rejecting, you signal that you value the product higher and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  You are signaling willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price.
* **Target Value:** You're aiming for a price above your minimum while still leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for your counteroffer (""meeting in the middle"") can make it seem more reasonable and agreeable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11,500? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gain vs. Risk:** While $11,500 is below your initial target, it's only $500 less than John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Further negotiation might only yield small increments, and there's a risk Bob might walk away.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now provides immediate value, whereas continued negotiation delays the sale. 

By accepting Bob's offer of $11,500, you secure a reasonable profit while minimizing potential risks."
