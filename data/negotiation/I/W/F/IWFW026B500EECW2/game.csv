"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to $900,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground that's fair to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $800,000 is a good step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping for something closer to $850,000.  This would be a mutually beneficial deal, and I believe we can find a compromise there.",850000.0,Alice,5,
