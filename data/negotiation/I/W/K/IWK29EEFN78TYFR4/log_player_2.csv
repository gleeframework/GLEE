"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm confident it's worth more than $150 to you. Considering its exceptional features and the impact it could have on your needs, I'm proposing to sell it to you for $200. This price reflects not only the product's worth but also the opportunity to secure such a valuable item at a premium. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what you can get the product for from John. You should reject her offer and see if she'll come down to a more reasonable price or buy from John."
