,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $12,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. How about $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and would allow me to make this purchase.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",14000.0,Alice,7,
