Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,100,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Even though Bob increased his offer considerably, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer. I'll try to negotiate further."

While I understand your constraints, the value this product brings to the table is substantial. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept a price as low as $950,000.

Bob is now very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome than $1,000,000. Accepting this offer secures a good profit."
