"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's strategically sound to begin with an offer significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a higher profit.
* **Confident Language:**  The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Acknowledging that the price is a starting point and expressing willingness to discuss further invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  While there's a risk Bob might walk away, it's early in the negotiation, and you have room to maneuver. Selling to John guarantees your minimum, but there's still potential to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.  How about we consider $1,875,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Low Offer:** Bob's offer was significantly below your minimum, so a clear rejection is necessary.
* **Justification:**  By stating that his offer undervalues the product, you reiterate its worth without directly shutting down negotiations.
* **Compromise:**  Meeting halfway between your initial offer ($2,250,000) and his counteroffer ($1,200,000) shows flexibility and willingness to find common ground. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one?  Would you consider $1,537,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,537,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,537,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating more realistically, and his offer is above your guaranteed sale price with John. However, it's still below Bob's own perceived value of the product ($1,500,000). You have leverage to push for a bit more, especially with several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on this.  To make this happen, I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about we settle at $1,650,000?"",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** You want to encourage Bob that you're moving closer to a deal.
* **Small Concession:** By only dropping $187,500, you signal that you're nearing your bottom line but are still willing to negotiate.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:**  This price aims to secure a deal while still getting you a profit margin above Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. 
* **Simple Proposal:** A clean and straightforward offer can help expedite the closing process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  I'm willing to meet you halfway to close this out.  Would you consider $1,593,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,593,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,593,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer is now significantly above your guaranteed sale price with John and represents a healthy profit margin. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could try to push for a bit more, the potential gains are getting smaller, and there's a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and secures your profit. Halfway through the rounds, this is a reasonable point to agree."
