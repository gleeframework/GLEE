"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9800 is a more reasonable price considering the market value and our previous discussions. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than this. Is this a price you're willing to accept?",9800.0,Bob,6,
