{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm asking $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110 offer:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides security and allows me to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's offers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me though.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120. 
* **Counteroffer is a better strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price range. This keeps the negotiation going and increases the likelihood of reaching a more favorable outcome for me.
* **John is still a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 provides confidence that I can walk away if Bob's final offer isn't acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  I'm still willing to negotiate, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $87.50, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $65. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I emphasize that I'm still open to negotiation, suggesting flexibility and encouraging further dialogue.
* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer is strategically positioned to test Bob's willingness to come up from his initial offer. It gives him a fair price, while still giving me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a backup:**  I still have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$75 is still too low:** While closer to my minimum value, $75 is still significantly below what I'd ideally like to get. 
* **Continuing negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to $100.
* **John is a backup:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $120 gives me leverage and allows me to walk away if Bob's final offer isn't satisfactory.

**Strategy:**  At this point, I'm still focused on maximizing my profit.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to come up higher. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is still a little low for me. How about we meet at $80? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $80, which is closer to my desired price range but still a compromise from my previous offer of $87.50.
* **Reasoning:** I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to Bob while still giving me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Final attempt:** This is likely my final attempt to get a better price from Bob. I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept this offer.
* **Positive phrasing:** I use positive phrasing to encourage Bob to agree to my offer.
* **John as a backup:** I still have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low."
