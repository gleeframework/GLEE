Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product, just like I offered in round 6. I think that's a fair price considering the value it brings and the price you're looking for.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and while $980,000 is a good offer, it's not quite enough to make it worthwhile for me. I'm confident I can get my desired $1,000,000 from John, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
