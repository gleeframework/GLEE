"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",10500.0,Alice,5,
