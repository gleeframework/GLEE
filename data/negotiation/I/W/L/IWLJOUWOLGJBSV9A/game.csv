"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and show that I'm serious about purchasing the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer and for recognizing the value of this product. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, however,  $1,600,000 is still significantly lower than what I have in mind.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1,300,000 is the maximum I can go. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I understand your budget constraints. Let's land at $1,350,000. This demonstrates my willingness to find a compromise while still acknowledging the product's worth. ",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
