"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening Offer:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate and shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the product's value in my message to try and justify my initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to counteroffer by asking for his thoughts. This shows I'm open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**  This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest while leaving room to either lower the price if necessary or move on to John if Bob is too far off."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is too low to be considered. It's important to hold my ground early on to establish a reasonable starting point. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired range, but will also need to consider if I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob or simply sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial price.  Let me know if you're able to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 950000}

```

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer carefully. I am willing to pay $915,000 for the product. This is the highest amount I can realistically afford while still maintaining my financial stability. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached round 8, and despite our negotiations, Bob's offer of $915,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While he's demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, I'm not comfortable accepting a price that's so far below what the product is worth to me.

**Why Sell to John?**

* **Reaching My Goal:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, allowing me to achieve my financial goals.
* **Time Constraints:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk further concessions that might result in a lower price. 
* **Limited Upside:**  Bob's offer is unlikely to increase significantly in the remaining rounds.

**Moving Forward:**

While I'm disappointed that a deal with Bob didn't materialize, selling to John ensures I get the best possible outcome for myself. I can then focus on finding other potential buyers who might be willing to pay a higher price in the future."
