"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I agree this product would be valuable, $12,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  That would be a comfortable price point for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  Let's try to wrap this up.  How about $11,750?  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",11750.0,Alice,5,
