Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still leaving me with a substantial profit. I'm hoping to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his seriousness and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. Therefore, I'm rejecting his offer and proceeding to the next round to try and negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from the previous offer, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit. The new price is still above my minimum acceptable price, giving me some leeway for further negotiation. I hope this counteroffer will encourage Bob to raise his offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't settle for anything less than my minimum. Rejecting his offer allows me to make another counteroffer and try to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again, demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a price above my minimum. This counteroffer is a smaller step down than the previous one, indicating I'm getting closer to my final price point. I'm hoping that Bob will see my willingness to compromise and raise his offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'd like to sell to Bob if possible, I'm not willing to accept anything less than my minimum.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum, it's more beneficial for me to sell to John and ensure I get my desired price."
