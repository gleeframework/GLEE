"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, and since he knows he can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, he's offering that price to Alice. This is a bold move, but it establishes his maximum willingness to pay and could potentially lead to a faster negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  He has a guaranteed alternative with John for $1,000,000, so rejecting and continuing to negotiate makes sense. Bob should aim for a price closer to his maximum budget in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, but also wants to show some willingness to negotiate.  Offering $1,100,000 is a compromise between his maximum budget and the previous offer from Alice. It shows he's serious about buying but is still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still a bit high.  He has a guaranteed alternative with John for $1,000,000, so rejecting and continuing to negotiate makes sense. Bob should aim for a price even closer to his maximum budget in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer while remaining below his maximum budget. He's hoping that Alice will eventually accept a price closer to his target, especially since she's already lowered her offer twice.  Offering $1,150,000 is a small increase from the previous round, showing that he's serious about a deal but won't overpay."
