"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me to consider.  This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident that a price closer to $1,000,000 would be mutually beneficial. How about we settle on $975,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you halfway from $950,000 to $975,000, but only if you can meet me at $962,500. This is my final offer.",962500.0,Bob,6,
