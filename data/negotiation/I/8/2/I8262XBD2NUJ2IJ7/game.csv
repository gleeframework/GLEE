"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, that figure is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could we settle on $1,100,000? I feel that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still quite a ways off from where I see this deal happening.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  If you're able to come up to $1,400,000, the product is yours.  Otherwise, I need to consider my other option.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
