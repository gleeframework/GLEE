To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still very interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. How about $925,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it shows I'm serious about buying.",925000.0,Bob,4,
