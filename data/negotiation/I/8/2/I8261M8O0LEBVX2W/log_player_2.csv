"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  I'm not desperate for this product and have another option with John. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer!  While I am interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to propose $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows for a profit for you and fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within my budget.**  $1,150,000 is lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **A reasonable compromise.**  Alice has already lowered her price, demonstrating her willingness to negotiate.  This is a good deal for both of us. 
* **Minimizing risk.** Continuing to negotiate could drag this out and potentially result in me paying more, or Alice getting frustrated and selling to someone else."
