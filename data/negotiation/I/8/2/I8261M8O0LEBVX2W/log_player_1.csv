Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer!  While I am interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to propose $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows for a profit for you and fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
