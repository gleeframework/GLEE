"Alice, thank you for the offer!  While I am interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to propose $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows for a profit for you and fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work!",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
