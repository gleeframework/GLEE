"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it allows for room to negotiate if Bob isn't willing to pay that much.  It's important to start high to gauge his interest and see how far we can go in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I could sell to John for $15,000, Bob's offer is my minimum value. I'm rejecting his offer, as I want to see if I can get a higher price from him. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. It shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price. While $16,000 is still lower than I'd like, it's a good deal considering we are halfway through the negotiation.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
