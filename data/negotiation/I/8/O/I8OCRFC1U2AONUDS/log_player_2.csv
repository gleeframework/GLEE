{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to pay as little as possible.  While $9,500 is better than Alice's original value, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further. There's also the option of buying from John for $8,000, which sets a clear target for Bob's negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum of $8,000.  A counteroffer of $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, showing Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a significant amount, but not her full asking price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than the previous round, but still higher than Bob's desired price.  It's important to remember that Bob has a safety net in John, who will sell the product for $8,000. This gives Bob the leverage to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing Alice that he's willing to meet her halfway but still pushing for a price closer to his goal.  The $8,750 offer is a good compromise, demonstrating that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but not willing to overpay."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to her original asking price, but it's still too high for Bob.  He's already close to his desired price point, and with the option of buying from John, there's no need to rush into accepting a deal that's not in his best interest.  It's time to continue negotiating and see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to compromise. $9,000 is a reasonable middle ground,  indicating he is serious about buying but is still mindful of his budget. It's a good strategy to see if Alice will accept a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to her initial price, indicating she is not willing to budge much further.  Bob has already made significant concessions and it's unlikely he'll get the price lower than $9,000.  With only 3 rounds left, it's better for Bob to secure the product at John's $8,000 price to ensure he gets the best possible deal.  This is a strategic decision, prioritizing a guaranteed low price over potentially getting a slightly better deal with Alice, especially with the risk of running out of time."
