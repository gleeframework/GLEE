"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm asking for $20,000 to start the conversation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his maximum budget of $12,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum. He should continue negotiating to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
