Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth seeing if she'll come down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000. This is a fair price that balances the value of the product with your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to your maximum.  Considering you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, it's worth accepting this offer to potentially get a slightly better deal. You can always try to negotiate further with Alice if you're truly determined to get a lower price."
