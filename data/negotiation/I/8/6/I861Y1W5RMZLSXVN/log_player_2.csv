"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $100, which I think strikes a balance between its worth and your perceived value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is a good price, I can potentially get it for even less.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on $90 for the product? This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

While $90 is closer to my target, I still have room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer once more before considering John's offer."
