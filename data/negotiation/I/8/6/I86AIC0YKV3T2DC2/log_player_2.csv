Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe my product has a significant value to offer.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.
