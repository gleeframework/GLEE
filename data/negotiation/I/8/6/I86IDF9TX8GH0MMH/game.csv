"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the value you mentioned, I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value this product offers.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise and a good starting point for us to finalize the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
