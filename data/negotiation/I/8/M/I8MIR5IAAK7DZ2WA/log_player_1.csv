Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter his offer or move on to John if his offer isn't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not satisfied with that price yet. Bob is clearly undervaluing the product, and I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price point. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with $10,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still remaining above Bob's initial offer. I believe this price is fair, reflecting the value of the product while still giving Bob a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,500 is a good deal and significantly higher than selling to John. It seems like we've reached a point where further negotiation might not yield a much higher price. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option."
