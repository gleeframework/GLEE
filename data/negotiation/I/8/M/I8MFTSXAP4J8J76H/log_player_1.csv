{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I am willing to compromise while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'll counteroffer Bob to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get Bob to agree to a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that. How about we meet in the middle at $96? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 96}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. Would you be willing to consider a price of $94? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $94 is closer to my target, I've already made several concessions, and the negotiations are starting to drag on.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  He's guaranteed to pay my minimum price, and I'll avoid further negotiation."
