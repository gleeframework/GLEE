"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and if he's willing to pay a premium.  I'm setting a high bar, and if he rejects it, we can negotiate down from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject** Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round.  I don't want to rush into selling to John just yet, as there's still potential to get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject** Bob's offer. While $850,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe we can reach a more favorable agreement. I'll counteroffer in the next round. I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I think I can still get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as I don't want to risk going too much lower and ending up with the same price as John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject** Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round.  I'm still optimistic that I can get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $850,000. This is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept. If he rejects, I might be forced to reconsider selling to John, as time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to **sell to John**.  

We're at the end of the negotiation with Bob, and he's not budging on his $800,000 offer. I've already rejected his offer twice, and I'm running out of time. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's the most logical choice at this point."
