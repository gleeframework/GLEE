"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. After reconsidering, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. I believe this price is still a good value for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $10,800 is still a little out of my range.  I'm confident we can reach a deal if we meet in the middle.  I'm offering $10,600.  Let's work together to make this happen.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point.",10700.0,Alice,5,
