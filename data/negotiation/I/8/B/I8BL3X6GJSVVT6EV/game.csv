"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $95. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is the lowest I can go without losing money. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is important to you, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can do $100, but that's absolutely my limit.",100.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $105. This is my final offer, so I hope you can see the value in the product and accept it.",105.0,Alice,7,
