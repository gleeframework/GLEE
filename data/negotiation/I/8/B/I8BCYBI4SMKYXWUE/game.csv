"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably spend. I'm going to stick with my offer of $9000.  If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,
