Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $120 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, as that's a good starting point to potentially get a higher price. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message, which could help build rapport and make Bob more likely to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth it!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
