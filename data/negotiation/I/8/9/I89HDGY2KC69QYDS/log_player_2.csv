Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product is good, but not $1.6 million good. How about we bring it down closer to reality? "", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation.  While $1.6 million may have been a starting point, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price better reflects the true value and potential this product offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to be serious about this, so let's try to find some middle ground. Would you consider $1,000,000?  That's my limit."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is  below what I can accept.  This product is truly exceptional and its value is undeniable. I'm prepared to make my final offer at $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to go below $1,150,000. You have a guaranteed option with John for $1,000,000. It's better to secure the product at your target price than risk Alice not budging further and potentially losing the product altogether."
