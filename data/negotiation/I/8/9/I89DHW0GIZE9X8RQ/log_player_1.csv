Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's a great deal at $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, it's best to start with an offer higher than your minimum ($120). This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to surprisingly accept a higher price. 
* **Justification:**  The message includes ""I think it's a great deal"" to subtly anchor the value in Bob's mind. 
* **""Offering to you first""**: This subtly implies scarcity and might make the offer more appealing.

**Important:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still room to negotiate down towards $120 before Alice goes to John."
