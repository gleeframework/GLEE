I'm starting with a significantly lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This is a bold move, but it might get her to consider a lower price point."

Alice's offer is still above my budget, though it's closer. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This is a more realistic price point considering Alice's last offer and my budget. Hopefully, this will make Alice more open to negotiation."

Alice's offer is closer to my budget, but still above it. I'll try to negotiate a little more before considering buying from John."

I'm going to make one final counteroffer at $1,450,000. This is still within my budget and hopefully, close enough to Alice's desired price that we can reach an agreement.  If she rejects this, I'll go with John's offer."
