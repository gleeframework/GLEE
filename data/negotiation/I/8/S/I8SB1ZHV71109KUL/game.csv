"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of this product, but your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm eager to make this work.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  That's a strong offer reflecting the true value of this product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
