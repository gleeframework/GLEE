Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also creates the perception of a deal compared to the eventual public price. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning listing the product publicly, we create a sense of urgency and make Bob feel like he has a limited-time opportunity."
