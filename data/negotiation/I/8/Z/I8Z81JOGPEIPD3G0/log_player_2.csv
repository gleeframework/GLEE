"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great deal considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than her product's value to her, you can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  Saving the extra $100,000 makes buying from John the better financial decision."
