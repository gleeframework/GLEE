{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than the value of the product to me.  I'm not willing to compromise further. I'll sell to John for $800,000 to avoid any further negotiation."
