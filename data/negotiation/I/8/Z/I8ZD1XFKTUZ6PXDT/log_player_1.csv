Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially saving you significant costs in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still lower than my guaranteed offer ($1,000,000). 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter."
