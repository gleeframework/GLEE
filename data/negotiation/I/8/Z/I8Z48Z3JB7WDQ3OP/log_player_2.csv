"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and $100 is still more than your maximum of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $85? I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, considering your interest in the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to your maximum, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90,  which is a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You've reached a point where Alice's offer is very close to your maximum, but you're still not comfortable paying that much. It's better to go with the guaranteed deal from John at $80, saving you $12.50."
