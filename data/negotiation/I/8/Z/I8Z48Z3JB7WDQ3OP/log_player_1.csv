"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $85? I'm sure we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm also confident that John is a reliable alternative buyer, so I have leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, considering your interest in the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90,  which is a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to take a little more risk and try to push Bob higher.  I'm also mindful of the fact that I have John as a backup buyer.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
