"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $85? I'm sure we can find common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, considering your interest in the product. Let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90,  which is a fair compromise. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",92.5,Alice,5,
