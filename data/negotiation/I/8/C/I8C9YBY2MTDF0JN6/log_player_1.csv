Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing he values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still securing a substantial profit above your minimum.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  While you could start higher, getting too close to $1,200,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
