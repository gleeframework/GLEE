"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I'm confident this product can bring you even more than $9,500 worth of benefit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you see the value in this product.  $9,800 is close, but to be fair to us both, I can't go any lower than $10,200. This is my final offer.",10200.0,Alice,5,
