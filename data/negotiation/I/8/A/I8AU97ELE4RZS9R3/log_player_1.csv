Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm starting high, aiming for a profit, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm interested in selling, $85 is too low for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  I'm flexible, but I can't go much lower than that."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $102.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $95?  That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I'm not yet ready to settle for $95. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above what I can afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can definitely make that work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting close to my minimum. It's important to close the deal and avoid the risk of Bob walking away completely, or me losing out on a sale to John."
