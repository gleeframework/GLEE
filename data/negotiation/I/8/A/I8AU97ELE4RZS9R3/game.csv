"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  I'm flexible, but I can't go much lower than that.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $102.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $95?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above what I can afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can definitely make that work.",97.5,Bob,6,
