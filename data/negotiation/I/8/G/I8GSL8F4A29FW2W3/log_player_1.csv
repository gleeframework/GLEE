"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,700,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with a strong initial offer that is significantly higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for concessions and gives the impression that the product is highly valuable.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to anchor Bob's perception of its worth above his estimated $800,000.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  While the price is high, expressing willingness to negotiate signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and your initial asking price. While it's a slight increase from his perceived value, there's plenty of room for negotiation. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed win, but we can likely negotiate a better deal with Bob with more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product in the wider market.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to make a deal, but it's also firm for the exceptional value you're receiving."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** We are making a significant concession from $1,700,000 to $1,450,000 to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further. However, we are also stating that this offer is ""firm"" to set a strong boundary and signal that we're serious about a price above $1,000,000.
* **Wider Market Value:** By mentioning the ""wider market,"" we are reminding Bob that the product likely has value beyond his immediate estimation, justifying a higher price. 
* **Urgency and Value:** The phrase ""willingness to make a deal"" implies that this offer is time-sensitive and reinforces the product's high value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product, which reflects a significant compromise on my part.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $950,000 is still under our $1,000,000 minimum. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate upwards, and we have plenty of rounds left to try and bridge the gap. The risk of losing him to a competitor is low at this point, as he's actively engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of this unique product.  What do you say, shall we make a deal?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** We're making another substantial drop in price to $1,250,000, meeting Bob closer to the middle ground.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""This is my final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to take this offer seriously.
* **Direct Appeal:** The language is becoming more direct (""What do you say, shall we make a deal?"") to encourage a close.
* **Holding Firm Above Minimum:**  We are still holding our price well above the $1,000,000 mark, maximizing our potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 exceeds our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's also a risk that Bob could reduce his offer or walk away. This offer represents a strong profit, and accepting now ensures a successful deal."
