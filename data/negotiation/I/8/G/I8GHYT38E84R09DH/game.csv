"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget,  $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still allows me to profit while offering you a competitive deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue this conversation.  $1300000 is getting closer to what I need. How about we split the difference and go with $1400000? I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while still being within your budget.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?,1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000. This offers a good compromise for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
