"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is not a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $12,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $12,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking of $18,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,5,
