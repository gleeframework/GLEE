"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle at $7,000?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750

While Bob is getting closer to my acceptable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $8,000.  It's not worth the risk of him dropping out entirely. John offers a guaranteed $8,000, which is my minimum.  It's time to secure the sale."
