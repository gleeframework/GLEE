"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item that will surely meet your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it, as that's the maximum I'm comfortable spending. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $150. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $155, which is closer to my limit and hopefully still fair for you. What do you say?",155.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $150. I think this is a fair compromise, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",160.0,Alice,5,
