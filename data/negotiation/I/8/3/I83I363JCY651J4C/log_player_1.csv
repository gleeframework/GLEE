{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is below Bob's perceived value but still higher than your minimum acceptable price. It also includes a friendly message that encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to consider $100 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, it's still below the value I want to get for the product. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Would you be willing to consider $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $110, Bob's offer of $105 is close enough to my target price and significantly higher than what John would pay. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids further negotiation."
