Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This allows for negotiation room while still giving me a potential profit.  

I believe this initial offer is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low, below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, it's worth trying to negotiate with Bob further. 

I will counter with a higher price, aiming to get closer to my desired price while still being within Bob's perceived value range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a reasonable price for Bob to consider, as it's still below his perceived value. 

This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also standing my ground. It's a calculated risk that might lead to a deal with Bob, but if it fails, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer.  While selling to John for $15,000 would be more profitable, there's no guarantee that another buyer will come along, and this negotiation is taking time.  

Accepting Bob's offer of $11,000 secures a sale, providing me with a profit.  While not ideal, it's a good compromise, especially considering Bob's perceived value of $10,000."
