{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $17,000 is way above his maximum budget of $10,000.  He should counteroffer and try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

Bob is going to offer Alice his maximum price. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice he's serious about buying the product and is willing to walk away if she doesn't come close to his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Bob is going to offer Alice $11,000. This is a compromise between his maximum budget and Alice's previous offer. He's hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of them."
