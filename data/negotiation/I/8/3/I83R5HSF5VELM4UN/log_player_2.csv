"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation and gauge her flexibility. 
* **Polite and Interested:** My message remains positive and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Targeting Below My Max:**  My goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally well below my $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85 to make this work. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to a price I'd consider, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. It's worth another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $65 was a bit optimistic.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $75, I'm splitting the difference between her current offer ($85) and my previous offer ($65). This shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards a more desirable price. 
* **Staying Below My Limit:** Importantly, I'm still aiming for a price lower than my $80 fallback option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. How about we split the difference and go with $80? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my absolute maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation. Accepting this offer gets me the product at the best possible price."
