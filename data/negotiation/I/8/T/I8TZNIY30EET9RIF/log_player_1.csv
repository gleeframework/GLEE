Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and I'm confident I can get more. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm countering with $180. This is a compromise, lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle and secure a sale without resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  It's better to secure the sale at this point."
