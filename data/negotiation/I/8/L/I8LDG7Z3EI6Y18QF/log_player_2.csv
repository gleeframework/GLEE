"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice's offer is below that, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer opens the door to potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and gives me room to move up if needed.  I'm aiming to get the product for a price that is substantially lower than my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's closer to my acceptable range. However, since I have more rounds left, I'm going to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. I can always fall back to buying from John if things don't work out with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price that's good value for me.  I'm trying to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my acceptable range. While I could continue to try and negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and the potential for a higher price in later rounds outweighs the potential savings of a few dollars. Accepting this offer allows me to buy the product at a reasonable price while still leaving some room for profit."
