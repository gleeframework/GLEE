"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000 from John, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, giving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $12,000, but it's still above the product's value to Alice ($8,000). This gives Alice some incentive to negotiate, while still allowing Bob to save a substantial amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price.  While it's lower than her initial offer, Bob can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's worth trying to get closer to his target price before potentially having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from $9,000 to $10,000.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a good deal.  It also leaves room for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is getting closer to Bob's upper limit of $15,000.  At this point, Bob has already made two counteroffers, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down any further.  To avoid potentially getting stuck in a drawn-out negotiation and risk ending up paying more, Bob should choose to buy from John for $15,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget while minimizing the risk of further price increases."
