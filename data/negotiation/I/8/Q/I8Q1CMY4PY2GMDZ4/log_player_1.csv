Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum value ($1,000,000). This gives room for negotiation while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and framing it as a mutually beneficial opportunity. This approach helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I believe I can push for a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant value the product holds, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm reducing my price slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum value, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the product's value and emphasizing a ""fair compromise"". This tone helps maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere while pushing for a more favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's a reasonable offer that allows me to meet my goal. Selling to John would net me the same amount, but taking Bob's offer avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection."
