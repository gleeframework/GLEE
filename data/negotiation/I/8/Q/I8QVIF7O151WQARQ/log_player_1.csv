{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  This reflects the product's high quality and potential benefits for your business.  I'm open to negotiating, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. There's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I want to see if I can get a better price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but it gives you a good deal considering its potential benefits. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or I won't be able to secure a higher price.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale at my floor price, which is a good outcome."
