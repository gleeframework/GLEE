Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $200, significantly higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone in the message makes the negotiation less confrontational. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm willing to negotiate with Bob. However, I'll be mindful of my minimum value and will not sell below $150.
* If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll assess his counter-offer. If it's too low, I'll make a counter-offer closer to my initial price.
* If the negotiations stall or if Bob becomes unreasonable, I'll switch to John, who will pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's interested and there's room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counter-offer closer to my initial price. This will show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price, but I'm also willing to negotiate.
* I'll aim for a price between $150 and $200, taking into account Bob's initial rejection and my own minimum value. 
* I'll be prepared to make further concessions, but I won't drop below $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand $200 was a bit high, but $100 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  This would still give me a fair price, and I think it's within your range. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my minimum price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving Bob a clear reason for my counter-offer, emphasizing my need for a fair price while also suggesting it's within his range.
* **Strategic Price:** $175 is a significant drop from my initial price but still above my minimum. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** I'm aiming for a price that's both acceptable to me and potentially appealing to Bob. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to make further concessions if necessary, but I'm also confident that $175 is a fair price. 
* **Alternative:**  I'll still have the option to sell to John if Bob rejects my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $150 is my absolute minimum, and Bob has offered that amount. 
* **No further gain:**  I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob, especially considering his willingness to pay my minimum.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate would require more time and effort, without a guarantee of a higher price.

**Strategy:**

*  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and efficiently.
*  While John is also willing to pay $150, selling to Bob might be more beneficial as it demonstrates my negotiation skills and opens the possibility of future transactions."
