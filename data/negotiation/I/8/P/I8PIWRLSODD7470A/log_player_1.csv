Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a different valuation. While $1,400,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John at $1,200,000."
