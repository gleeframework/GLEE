"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
