"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. My price is $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $115 leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum price of $120.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly tone helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Open-ended Question:** Encouraging Bob to respond with his thoughts gives him a sense of control and may lead to a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $105 is below my minimum threshold of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **John is a safety net:**  Having John as an alternative buyer gives me leverage to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize that this is still a ""good deal"" for Bob, appealing to his perception of value. 
* **Focus on fairness:** Mentioning ""fair profit"" subtly implies that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $105, but I think that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $107.50 is still below my minimum price of $120.
* **John's offer is better:** I have a guaranteed $120 from John, making it risky to accept Bob's offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm not completely out of options yet.  I can counter with a price that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $107.50 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $112.50? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a middle ground:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($110) and Bob's last offer ($107.50). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I use phrases like ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and make it seem like a reasonable solution.
* **Show urgency:** The statement ""gets us closer to a deal"" subtly implies that I'm open to negotiating but also that time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $112.50 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $112.50, which would be $108.75. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  There's no guarantee that he'll budge further in the remaining rounds. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $120 is guaranteed and exceeds my minimum.  This is a much safer option, as I'm already in the later rounds.
* **Time is Limited:**  With only 4 rounds left, there's a higher risk that we won't reach an agreement with Bob, and I'll be left with a lower price than John's offer."
