(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's no reason to accept it. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This establishes a clear baseline and puts pressure on Alice to come down from her initial price. I'm hoping she'll accept, but if not, we'll have to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, although it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to keep the price below my maximum limit. This should signal to Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but not at an unreasonable price. Hopefully, this will lead to further negotiations and a deal closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still too high for my budget. I'm not willing to pay that much, and I'm confident that with more negotiation, I can get her down closer to my desired price point.  We're halfway through the negotiation process, and I still have time to reach a deal that works for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping it well below Alice's last offer. I'm hoping this will show her that I'm willing to compromise while also pushing her closer to my desired price. We're approaching the midpoint of our negotiations, and I want to see if we can come to an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has actually gone up from the previous round, indicating that she might be getting more stubborn. With only three rounds left, the chances of reaching a good deal with Alice seem slim. It's better to secure the product from John at a price that is within my budget and saves me further negotiation hassle."
