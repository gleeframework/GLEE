``` 

This offer gives you a good profit margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob, who values the product at $1,500,000. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $1350000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,350,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose $1360000 as the price for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,360,000 is slightly lower than my last counteroffer, it's still a good profit for me and a fair price considering Bob's counteroffers. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, so accepting this offer seems like the best choice."
