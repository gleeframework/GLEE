"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to him to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to make a deal, selling for $60 would be a significant loss for me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $100? That's still a good price for you, considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving down on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. However, it's getting closer, and we've already had a few rounds of negotiation. It's possible that we might not be able to reach a mutually acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate could risk me losing the opportunity to sell to John. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
