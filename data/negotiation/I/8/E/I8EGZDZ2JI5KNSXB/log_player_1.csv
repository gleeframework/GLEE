Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I understand its value to you, but I'm only able to go up to $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation.
