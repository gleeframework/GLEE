Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
