"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but still within a range where he might be willing to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing it as a win-win situation for both of us. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, as I expect him to. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value is still too low:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential to negotiate further:** While Bob is unwilling to pay my initial price, he is showing interest in the product and is willing to negotiate.
* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John would be the most profitable, but it would also eliminate the possibility of potentially reaching a higher price with Bob.  

Therefore, I choose to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go down to $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250?  This would give you a significant discount from my original offer and still allow me to cover my costs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). 
* **Maintaining my value:**  $13,250 is still above Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:**  I'm reiterating that finding a solution that works for both of us is the goal. 

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,750. I'm still a bit short of my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can get closer to my target price. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,750 remains below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While he's showing a commitment to buying the product, the price is still too low for me to consider.
* **Room for negotiation:** Even though we are nearing the halfway point of the rounds, there's still potential for further negotiation. 
* **Weighing opportunity cost:** While selling to John for $15,000 is the most lucrative option, I'm still hopeful that I can reach a better price with Bob, especially since he seems genuinely interested.

Therefore, I choose to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him in the hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your commitment to buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can come down a little further to $13,000.  This offer reflects a substantial discount from my initial price and represents a significant investment on your part. Let's try to bridge the gap and make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession by dropping the price to $13,000, demonstrating my willingness to reach a deal.  This is closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than his latest counteroffer.
* **Highlighting the discount:** I'm emphasizing the discount from my initial offer to make the price more appealing to Bob.
* **Strong closing statement:**  I'm emphasizing the need to bridge the gap and make the deal happen. 

This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, while still keeping the price relatively high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to be at or below $12,500. Can we meet at $12,750 or lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are at the halfway point of the negotiation, and Bob is firmly set on his price of $12,500.
* **Significant gap:** There's still a significant gap between our desired prices, and further negotiations might not yield a satisfactory result for me.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I'd like to maximize my earnings, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is too high. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.

Therefore, I choose to sell the product to John for $15,000, as it is the most secure and profitable option at this point in the negotiation."
