Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to offer $850000 for it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to offer $875000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875000 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my target price, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. To get this deal done, I'm willing to go up to $880000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can find a way to agree.  If not, I'll have to consider other options.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $900000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, and I think it's still a great value for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options, including selling the product to John for $800000.",900000.0,Alice,7,
