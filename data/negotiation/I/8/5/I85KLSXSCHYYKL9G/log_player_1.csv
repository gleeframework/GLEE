"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $12,000. It's worth every penny, and I know you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message, hoping to build a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to sell for $9,500, I believe I can do better by continuing to negotiate. $9,500 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? That gives us both a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on my desire to get a price closer to my desired value.  I'm also using a positive and encouraging tone in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still think I can get a better deal. I'm going to try to counter with a price that's closer to my desired value.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's try $10,250.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm continuing to try and find a compromise with Bob. I've lowered my offer slightly, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that by showing I'm willing to negotiate, he will come up with a counteroffer closer to my desired value.  I'm also using a positive and encouraging tone in my message to keep the negotiation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. Bob seems to be stuck on his price, and I'm starting to run out of time.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price if I keep negotiating with Bob."
