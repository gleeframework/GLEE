Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This offer stands before I open it to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John, your goal is to maximize your profit. Offering it to Bob first at a price higher than his perceived value but lower than your guaranteed sale price allows for this possibility.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $950,000 is carefully chosen:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($800,000), giving you room for negotiation if needed.
    * It's still a substantial discount from John's offer, making it potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
