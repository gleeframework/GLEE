"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This should incentivize Bob to counteroffer, and it allows me to gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counter-offering at $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $100. This shows I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm still not willing to sell at a price that is significantly below my minimum.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a final counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept as I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can push for a slightly higher price. There are still a few rounds left to negotiate, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $98. This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm getting close to accepting his offers. It's a delicate balance, but I believe this is a good price that's both fair to Bob and still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm not confident that I can push Bob to meet my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $120. Although it's not my ideal price, it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with an even lower offer."
