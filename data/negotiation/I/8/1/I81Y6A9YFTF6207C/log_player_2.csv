"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and buying from John would cost you more. This is a good deal!"
