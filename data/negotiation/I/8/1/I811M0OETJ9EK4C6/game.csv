"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I recognize the product's value, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you are trying to meet me halfway.  However, I'm still unable to go higher than my initial offer of $1,000,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at your initial offer of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a good value considering the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
