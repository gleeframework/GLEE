,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider a price of $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
