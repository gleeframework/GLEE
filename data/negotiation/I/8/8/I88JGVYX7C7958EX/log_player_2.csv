"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer to sweeten the deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fantastic price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

**Explanation:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. 
* While Alice is willing to make a concession, it's still not a good deal for Bob.
*  Bob can buy the product from John for $800,000, which is the best option for him."
