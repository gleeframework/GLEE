Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

This is a reasonable offer that still gives Bob some room to negotiate, while also giving me a decent profit margin. Let's see what he has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $11,000. Since this is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Next, I'll make a new offer that's slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer, but still below my minimum acceptable price:

{""product_price"": 11,500}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 11,750}
