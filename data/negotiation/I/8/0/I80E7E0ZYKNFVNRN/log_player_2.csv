"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely do better by counter-offering.  There's room for negotiation, as Alice values the product at $12,000 and Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  How about $13,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's desire to negotiate.
* **Fair Offer:**  It's still above Alice's value of $12,000, making it a potentially acceptable compromise.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's still room for further negotiation if needed.  Bob can adjust his offer again if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice's offer of $14,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what he'd pay John ($15,000) and closer to his target price. 
* **Avoid Further Negotiation:**  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice becoming unwilling to sell at all.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and could lead to losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether."
