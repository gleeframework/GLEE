"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant amount above my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product, but I'm not giving it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a price point that's closer to my desired amount. I hope this will be more appealing to Bob and encourage him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $8,750. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's latest offer. It's a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly stubborn and doesn't seem to be willing to budge.  It's getting close to my minimum price but isn't ideal.  I've only got 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk going lower.  I'm going to sell to John for $8,000, as it's a guaranteed sale and  meets my minimum price."
