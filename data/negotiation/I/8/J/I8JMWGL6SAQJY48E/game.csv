"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit higher than your proposal. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.

Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal!",875000.0,Alice,3,
