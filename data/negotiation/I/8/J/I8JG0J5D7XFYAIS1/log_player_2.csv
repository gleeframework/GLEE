"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John."
