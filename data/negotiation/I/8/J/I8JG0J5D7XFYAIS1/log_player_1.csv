Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Above the Guaranteed Sale:** The offer is significantly higher than John's offer ($1,000,000), ensuring that Alice is maximizing potential earnings.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
