Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $12000 for this item. Would you consider accepting such a price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $25,000, I'd like to reject it and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. I'll also keep in mind that I can sell the product to John for $15,000, so I'll aim to get closer to that price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $18000 is still beyond my current budget. I am looking to stay within $12000 for this purchase. Would it be possible for us to reach a compromise at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I've already rejected Bob's offer of $12,000 once, and now he's repeating it. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous counteroffer of $18,000, and I'm not confident that Bob will be willing to go higher than $12,000. Given that I can sell the product to John for $15,000, I think it's time to cut my losses and move on to the next buyer.
