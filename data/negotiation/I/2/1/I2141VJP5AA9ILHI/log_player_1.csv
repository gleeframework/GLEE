Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000.  What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is his maximum budget, and it's far below your minimum acceptable price. There's no room for negotiation that would bring you close to your desired profit. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price, making it the most logical choice to maximize your profit."
