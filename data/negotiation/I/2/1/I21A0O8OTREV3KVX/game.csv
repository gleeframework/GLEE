"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. Please consider this offer carefully, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $12,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
