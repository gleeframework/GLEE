"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we discussed, the product is worth $800000 to you, but I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
