"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you and a fair price for me.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8750? This would still be a great value for you, and it gives me some breathing room.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see we're getting closer!  Let's try $8500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal on track.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $8350. Can we meet at this price?",8350.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there! I understand your budget, and I'm willing to compromise just a little more. Let's try $8400.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a win-win. What do you say?",8400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $8400 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $8200, but no higher. Can we meet at this price?",8200.0,Bob,8,
