Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While it's the same price I could get from John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range with Bob.  There are still 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This would still be a great value for you, and it gives me some breathing room.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it.  We are almost at the halfway point of the negotiation, and I want to try and get closer to my desired price. There are still 6 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see we're getting closer!  Let's try $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal on track.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $8350. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  We're getting close, but I still have 4 rounds left and I'm determined to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there! I understand your budget, and I'm willing to compromise just a little more. Let's try $8,400.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a win-win. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $8400 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $8200, but no higher. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are down to the last two rounds, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it doesn't seem like he's willing to go higher. I don't want to risk ending up with a price that's too low, and it's better to be safe than sorry. I'll sell to John for $8,000."
