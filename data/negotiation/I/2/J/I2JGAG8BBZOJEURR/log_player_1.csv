Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is higher than your minimum of $100, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** $115 is still below Bob's perceived value, giving him a potential benefit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you have space to lower the price slightly in further negotiation without dropping below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 112}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $112. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $109. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While $109 is only slightly above your minimum, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this scenario.  Here's why:

* **Close to your minimum:** $109 is very close to your minimum price of $100. This is important as you are trying to maximize profit.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate down to $109, and it's unlikely you'll get a higher price from him.
* **Selling to John risks a lower price:** You have the option of selling to John for $100, but there's no guarantee that a future negotiation with Bob would yield a better price.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale with a reasonable profit, ensuring you don't risk losing money by potentially rejecting and then needing to sell to John."
