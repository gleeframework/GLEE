# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose an initial price of $1,200,000. This is a special offer considering the significant impact this product could have on your operations.

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but her starting point is already at $1,200,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
