Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  A $13,000 offer is below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it likely he'll engage in negotiations.
* **Provides a good profit:** It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $10,000, ensuring you make a good profit.
* **Sets a clear starting point:** A specific offer allows Bob to respond more easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, Bob's offer of $10,500 is within my minimum acceptable price range and is a better deal than selling to John for $10,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to secure the sale."
