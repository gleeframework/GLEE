"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $120?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for countering.  I understand the product is valuable to you, but $120 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $75.  This product is worth a lot to me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
