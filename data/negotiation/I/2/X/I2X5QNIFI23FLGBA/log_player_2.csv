"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $20,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000. This sets a clear limit and hopefully incentivizes Alice to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want a significant discount. Hopefully, she'll see the value in closing the deal at this price rather than risking further negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** $16,500 is still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice, as I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm also mindful of the fact that I have several rounds left to get a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $12,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground between our current positions. Alice has lowered her price twice now, so I'm hoping this offer shows that I'm making a serious effort to reach a deal. I believe we are getting closer to an agreement, and I'm confident that we can find a mutually acceptable price in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high, and I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. I have several rounds left, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal. It's also important to remember that I can always buy from John for $8,000 if I don't get a satisfactory offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has lowered her price, but it's still too high. This time, I'm offering $14,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but also shows that I'm still not willing to pay an exorbitant price. I believe this offer is more likely to be accepted than previous ones, as it represents a middle ground and signals a willingness to reach a deal. I'm also mindful of the limited rounds remaining and the fact that I can always purchase from John as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** With only one round left, Alice has not shown a strong willingness to budge on price.  It's unlikely I'll be able to get a price lower than $15,500 in this last round.  It's more advantageous for me to secure the product from John for $8,000, saving a considerable amount of money compared to Alice's final offer."
