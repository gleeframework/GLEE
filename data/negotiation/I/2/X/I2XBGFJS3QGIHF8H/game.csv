"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,300,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This still leaves you with a substantial profit margin, so I believe it's a fair offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1,175,000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $1,250,000 is my final offer.  Let's close this deal!",1250000.0,Alice,5,
