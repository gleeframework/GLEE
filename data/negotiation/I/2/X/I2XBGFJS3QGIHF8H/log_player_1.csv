Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,300,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This still leaves you with a substantial profit margin, so I believe it's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. I need to see a more serious offer before I consider selling.  I'll try to counter with a higher price that's closer to what I want."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1,175,000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $1,250,000 is my final offer.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
