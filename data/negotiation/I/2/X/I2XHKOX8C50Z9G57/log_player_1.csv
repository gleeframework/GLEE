"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum value, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't go below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,500. This is still above my minimum value and shows I'm willing to compromise, but it's also a reasonable middle ground between our initial offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  It's getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm offering $15,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value, and we're running out of rounds.  It's not worth risking a further decrease in price. I'll sell to John, who is guaranteed to pay my minimum value."
