Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $80 is a bit low for me. I can do $120, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $110, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if that works for you.

Alice is unlikely to go below $110, and it's better to secure the product for $100 from John than risk paying more."
