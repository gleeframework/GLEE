Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit ($9,500 - $10,000 = $500 loss) if Bob rejects it.  However, it's also close enough to Bob's valuation ($8,000) that he might be willing to accept it and make a small profit for himself. This strategy balances my desire for a higher price with the risk of Bob rejecting my offer."
