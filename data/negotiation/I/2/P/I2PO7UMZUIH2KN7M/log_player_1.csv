Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to leave some room for negotiation while still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and it might be a good compromise for Bob."
