Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $12,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. That's my final offer. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $13,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $12,000 rather than risk Alice walking away and potentially losing the product altogether."
