Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $110 is below my minimum threshold, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 125}

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $115 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my asking price.
