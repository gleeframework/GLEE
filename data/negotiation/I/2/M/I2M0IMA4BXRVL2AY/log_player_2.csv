"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value.** You're willing to pay up to $120, and her offer is $100, which leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's early in the negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer allows you to explore a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $90 for the product? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.**  $90 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Be polite and positive.**  A friendly tone can help keep negotiations open. 
* **Frame the offer as a win-win.**  The message suggests that finding a middle ground benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  Let's meet in the middle at $95.  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, and her offer is $95. 
* **It's a good compromise.** Alice has moved closer to your price, and further negotiation may take more time and not necessarily result in a significantly better price. 
* **You're saving money.**  Accepting this offer gets you the product for $25 less than what you'd pay John."
