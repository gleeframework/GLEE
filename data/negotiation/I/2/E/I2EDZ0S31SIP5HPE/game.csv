"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to facilitate a deal.  Let's meet in the middle at $825,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings, and it's still a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,
