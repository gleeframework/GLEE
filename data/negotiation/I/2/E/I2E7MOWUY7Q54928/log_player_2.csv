"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting price.  I'm interested in the product, but  $1,500,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,500,000 represents the high-end of its value, $800,000 undervalues its unique capabilities.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,200,000 is closer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. $950,000 is getting closer, but I need to ensure this deal reflects the true value of the product.  Would you be willing to meet at $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000. You can see she's negotiating down slowly. Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses and take that guaranteed deal.  You'll save $50,000 and avoid potentially tougher negotiations with Alice."
