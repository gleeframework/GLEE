"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still within Bob's budget. It's worth seeing if Alice will go lower. There's no harm in rejecting the offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's offering $10,000, which is still $2,000 above Alice's valuation. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, and if Alice rejects it, Bob can still counter-offer again in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much as possible.  $11,500 is closer to his goal, but it's still above his ideal price point. He can continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice to come down further.  There are still several rounds left, and he doesn't want to settle too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is a compromise point, still $500 less than Alice's offer.  It's likely that Alice will accept this offer, as she's already come down from $12,000 to $11,500. However, if Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to consider if he wants to continue negotiating or go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,200, which is only $200 above Bob's last counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob, as he's managed to negotiate a price significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price. Continuing to negotiate might get him a slightly better price, but it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away.  There's also the risk that Bob might not be able to get a better price from John.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product."
