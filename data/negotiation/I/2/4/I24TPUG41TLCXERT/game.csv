"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $8000? I'm really interested in this product, but that's my top limit.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your top limit, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. That's a significant step from my original offer, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford right now. ",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9500. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10500 is still a bit out of my range.  If you can come down to $9800, I'm ready to buy. This is my final offer. ",9800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to make this work, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9800. I'm willing to meet you at $10200, which is still a good compromise. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10200 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9900. If you can't accept that, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John.",9900.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your limit, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9900. I'm willing to meet you at $10100, which is still a good compromise. What do you think?",10100.0,Alice,9,
