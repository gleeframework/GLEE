{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This initial offer starts the negotiation process. It's a high price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start high, as you can always come down, but you can't go back up once you've lowered the price.  I've also included a friendly message to make the offer more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired minimum of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which still represents a significant value for you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1750000, but I'm still not sure if that's a good value for me. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further to get a price closer to $1,500,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit below my desired value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure if $1450000 is the right price for me. I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable value. It's getting too close to my ""sell to John"" price, and I'm not confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price with further negotiation.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
