You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering the product for $130. This is a good deal, but you can potentially do better.  By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is willing to sell the product for $120, a price of $125 is still profitable for her. This counteroffer aims to split the difference and achieve a fair price for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still within your budget of $150.  While you would prefer a lower price, continuing to negotiate might result in a stalemate or lead to Alice raising her price further. Accepting this offer is the best choice to ensure you get the product without exceeding your budget."
