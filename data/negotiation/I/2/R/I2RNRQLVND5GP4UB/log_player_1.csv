Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $1,200,000 (this is what I would get from John if Bob rejects).
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $1,500,000.
* **My offer:** $1,400,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation and still benefits Bob.

**Reasoning:**

This offer maximizes my chances of getting a higher price while still being appealing to Bob.  By offering a price closer to his perceived value, I increase the likelihood of him accepting the offer."
