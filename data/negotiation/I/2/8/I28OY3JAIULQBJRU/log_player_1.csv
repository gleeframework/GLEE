Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  A $4,000 difference between my offer and Bob's perceived value gives us some room to negotiate. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as an option for $15,000 allows me to be firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is too low:**  While it's above Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I can likely get a better price by counteroffering.
* **John's Offer:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position and allows me to be less likely to accept offers that are too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the product's value and still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** This counter-offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a comfortable margin.
* **Meeting halfway:**  $11,000 is a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to remind Bob of its worth and potentially motivate him to come up on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below desired price:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. While it's closer, it's still not a good enough deal for me.
* **Negotiation potential:** I can likely get a better price by counteroffering one more time.
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position and allows me to be less likely to accept offers that are too low.  I can comfortably reject Bob's offer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,500 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. This is a fair price that takes into account both our perspectives.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this offer."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is likely my last counteroffer as it's getting closer to my minimum price.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This price is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  The message emphasizes that this is a fair price that acknowledges both parties' positions.
* **Closing the Deal:**  The message signals that this is a final offer, encouraging Bob to accept or risk losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $9,800 is very close to my minimum desired price of $15,000, but it's still significantly less.
* **No More Room for Negotiation:**  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price that is satisfactory for me.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a much better outcome for me. I can secure a price that is closer to my desired value and avoid any further risk or potential frustration with Bob."
