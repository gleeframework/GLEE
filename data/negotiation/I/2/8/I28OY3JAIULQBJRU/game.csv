"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the product's value and still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,500 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. This is a fair price that takes into account both our perspectives.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this offer.",10250.0,Alice,5,
