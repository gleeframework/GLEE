Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to see if I can get a better deal, or at least get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to go a few rounds with Bob before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but  $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $875,000. I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can get a bit closer to $900,000.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. While $825,000 is a more reasonable offer, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 850000}
