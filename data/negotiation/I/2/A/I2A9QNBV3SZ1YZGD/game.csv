"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I believe it holds great potential for your business, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My initial price is $950,000.  Let's discuss!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but  $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $875,000. I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While $825,000 is a more reasonable offer, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward.",850000.0,Alice,5,
