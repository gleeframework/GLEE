Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $1,400,000 is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum price ($1,500,000) but still above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). 
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves room for negotiation, as I can go lower if needed, or Bob might counter with a higher offer. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Mentioning John (the other buyer) isn't explicitly stated, but it subtly implies I have other options, encouraging Bob to take the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing his incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation room remains:** There's still space to negotiate with Bob. I can likely secure a higher price if I continue the negotiation.
* **John's offer is the best:**  Selling to John would guarantee my minimum price and avoid any potential risk of a further decline in the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer signals that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary, putting pressure on him to improve his offer.

**Next steps:**  I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming to close the gap while still staying above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,300,000).
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  It's still above my minimum price of $1,500,000, which is important to ensure I don't lose out.
* **Fairness and Compromise:**  The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the offer, making it more attractive to Bob.
* **Urgency without Pressure:**  The message encourages Bob to respond promptly without being too pushy. 

**Next steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he still refuses, I might reconsider selling to John, but I'm optimistic that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
