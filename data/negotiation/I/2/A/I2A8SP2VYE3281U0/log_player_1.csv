Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $20,000 offer leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest and encourage a response.  

**Important Note:** There's an element of risk involved. If Bob outright rejects the $20,000, I'll miss out on the potential profit above $15,000. However, the potential reward for a higher sale price makes this approach worthwhile."
