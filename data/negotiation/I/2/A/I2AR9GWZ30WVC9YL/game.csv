"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $850,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which is $875,000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value to your business.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial asking price.",825000.0,Alice,7,
