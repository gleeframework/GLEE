"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for $9,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, you have 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It demonstrates your willingness to compromise, while still being within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend around $8,500, but I have to make a profit. I can do $9,200, and that's as low as I can go. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down a bit, but she's still above your target price.  You have rounds remaining, and you're still trying to get the best deal possible. Rejecting allows for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer of $8,500. How about $8,800?  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're staying firm with your goal of a lower price, but also showing flexibility by offering a slight increase from your previous counteroffer. This demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate, but you're also trying to stay within your target range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're still a bit off from my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,000, and that's as low as I can go. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is the same as her initial offer. While you initially rejected that price,  you've now gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely she will go lower. Accepting her offer gets you a decent price within your budget, and prevents further negotiation."
