,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product holds substantial value, and I believe $17,000 is a fair compromise. It reflects the quality and worth you're getting.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. Would you be willing to consider $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
