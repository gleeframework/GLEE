"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. Is this something you'd like to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate further.  While Alice's offer is good, I can potentially save more money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

```

Alice has come down to a price of $850,000. This is a good deal for me, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000. It's worth accepting this offer and finalizing the deal."
