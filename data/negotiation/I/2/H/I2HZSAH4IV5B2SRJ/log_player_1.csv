Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $13,000. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for a price higher than your minimum ($8,000).
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering it slightly below Bob's perceived value ($13,000) gives him a sense of a deal while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Backup Option:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob's valuation in mind. If you started too high, Bob might reject it outright, leaving you with the $8,000 from John. This offer balances risk and potential reward."
