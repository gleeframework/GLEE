"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $9,000 is still a little bit outside my budget. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering the value.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
