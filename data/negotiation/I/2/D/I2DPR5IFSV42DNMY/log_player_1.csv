"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while also reflecting the value I place on the product. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer just yet. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a fair profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hesitant to accept. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000, which is just slightly above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept the deal. If he rejects, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000, as I don't want to risk going any lower and potentially losing more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I've already made several concessions.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  It's time to secure the guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000."
