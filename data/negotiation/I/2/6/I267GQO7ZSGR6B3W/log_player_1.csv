Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $130. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but even if he successfully brings the price down a bit, Alice is still making a profit significantly higher than selling to John. 
* **Confidence:**  By confidently stating the product's value, Alice increases the perceived worth in Bob's mind. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for Alice while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
