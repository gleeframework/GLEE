Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle at $925,000? This gives us both a good deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $890,000 is certainly better than your previous offer. However, I still need to be closer to $950,000 to make this deal work for me. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, considering the value we both place on this product. What do you think?

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is stubbornly trying to stay above $950,000.  While we might be able to negotiate her down a tiny bit further, it's unlikely to be worth the risk. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000. It's more sensible to cut our losses and secure the product at that price."
