It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to save money."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while pushing for a more favorable price."

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still higher than my initial counteroffer.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $850,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good deal. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Alice and lead to a successful negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial price. While I would have preferred a lower price, it's still a considerable saving compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer is the most sensible option, as further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely."
