# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  $130
* **Your Value:** $150
* **Alice's Value:** $120

Accepting Alice's offer results in a net gain for you ($150 - $130 = $20) and a net gain for Alice ($130 - $120 = $10).  Rejecting the offer and buying from John would cost you $150, resulting in no profit."
