,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8,500.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll sell it to you for $8,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",8000.0,Alice,5,
