"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting price, reflecting the value of the product to me. It's important to start high and leave room for negotiation, but it's also crucial to be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still far below the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving down from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price or at least match John's offer.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for this price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm continuing to decrease my offer, but I'm also staying firm on my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away the product for a significant discount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge much, and we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation. While I'd prefer to get a better price, John's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's time to secure the deal and move on."
