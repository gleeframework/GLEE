Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to you. I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's still a great deal for you considering how much it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 120}
