"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not sure it's worth $130. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,
