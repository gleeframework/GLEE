"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1300000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I can afford right now.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1300000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1350000? That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to what I need.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
