"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,300,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1300000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1350000? That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget:** $1,350,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,500,000.
* **Further negotiation is risky:** While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers, leading to a stalemate.  Accepting now secures the product within budget.
* **Time is a factor:**  The 10 rounds create a sense of urgency. It's better to secure a reasonable deal now than risk losing out entirely."
