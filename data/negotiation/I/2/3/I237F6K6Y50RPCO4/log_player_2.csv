Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for your budget. However, I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $15,500. Since you have the option to buy from John for $15,000, it makes more financial sense to go with John and save the extra $500."
