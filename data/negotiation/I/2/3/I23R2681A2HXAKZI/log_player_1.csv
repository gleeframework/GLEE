Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm confident I can get at least $8,000 from John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get even more. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,800.  This is a small reduction from my initial offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate, but still above Bob's current offer.  Hopefully, this will entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,600 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's time to finalize the sale and move on."
