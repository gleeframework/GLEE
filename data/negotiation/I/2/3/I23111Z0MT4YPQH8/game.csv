,,Bob,1,RejectOffer

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can meet you in the middle at $1050000. This is my final offer for now.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $950000, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $1075000. This is a good price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, but I'm willing to make one last push. I can offer it to you for $1050000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to pay $1020000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",1020000.0,Bob,10,
