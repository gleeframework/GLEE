"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. 

By starting high, I leave room for negotiation and can potentially secure a better price. However, I'm also aware that if Bob rejects, I can always go to John and get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

Since I have 10 rounds, I have the luxury of exploring other options.  I'm willing to lower my price, but I'll start by rejecting his offer and then make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $13,000 to $11,000, but I'm still above Bob's offer. I want to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but also show that I won't accept a price that's too low.  This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while still keeping me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below the value of the product to me. I have more rounds left and believe I can still get a better price. I'm willing to continue negotiating and try to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $10,000, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a comfortable margin. This demonstrates flexibility while still reflecting the value of the product.  The gap is now smaller, making it more likely Bob will accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I can still use the remaining rounds to negotiate further or go to John if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm still confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

We are now in the middle of the negotiation process, and it's getting tighter.  I'm willing to continue exploring other options, so I will reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a slight counteroffer of $9,750.  This is a compromise that is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's current offer of $9,500.  

The goal here is to show Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway and close the deal.  With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm aiming for a deal that is closer to my ideal price point, but also acceptable to Bob."
