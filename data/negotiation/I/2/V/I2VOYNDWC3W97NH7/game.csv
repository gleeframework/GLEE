"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I still think this product is worth more than $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95.  Let's make a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $115, which is still a good deal for you, and closer to my minimum price.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can agree.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to make one last offer to you, and that's $118. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",118.0,Alice,7,
