"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value Bob would gain, which could be persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll reject this offer and counter-offer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a significant saving compared to the product's worth to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $950000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough. I'll reject and try to push for a higher price. There are still rounds left and it's worth seeing if I can get closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway and offer it for $975,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $920000? I'm willing to make a final compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to make one more counter-offer and see if we can bridge the gap. We're getting close to the end of the rounds, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that's lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'm offering the product for $940,000.  This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. If you're not interested, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $915000? I'm willing to make a final compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing out on any profit. Selling to John for $800,000 will guarantee I at least break even, even if I'm disappointed in not getting closer to my desired price."
