"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Could you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a way to make this work.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,750. Can you consider that?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13,750 is still too far off from what I need.  I'm willing to go down to $14,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",14250.0,Alice,5,
