"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than John's offer of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. There's a significant gap between Alice's offer and your maximum value. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I do see its value, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still a good deal for me, as it's significantly lower than my maximum value of $1,200,000. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings."
