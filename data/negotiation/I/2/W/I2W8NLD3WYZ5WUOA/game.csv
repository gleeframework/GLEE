"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I do see its value, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
