{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum ($150) but acknowledging that Bob's value is lower ($120).  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The price isn't so high that Bob is immediately going to reject it, allowing for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and enthusiastic message encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started while still maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm happy to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $130 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. 
* **Opportunity for a higher price:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John as a backup:**  I have the option of selling to John for $150, which gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still pushing for a higher price.  Meeting in the middle suggests a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that $135 is a fair price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable. 

This counteroffer positions me to potentially close the deal at a price that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $132.50. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum ($150), it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I believe I can still get a slightly better price from Bob.  He's clearly interested in the product, and I'm confident I can push for a price closer to my desired amount.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer for $150 gives me the freedom to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a suboptimal offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling my commitment to a fair price and my willingness to keep negotiating.  I'll use the next round to try and bridge the remaining gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep working towards a solution.  I'm willing to come down to $134 for this product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 134}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my previous offer.  The price is still above Bob's last offer, but it's a step closer to his position.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as fair for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, increasing the likelihood of him accepting my offer.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my desired price and Bob's willingness to pay, potentially leading to a successful negotiation."
