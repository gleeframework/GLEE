"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
