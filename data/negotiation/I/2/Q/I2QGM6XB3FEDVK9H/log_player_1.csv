"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows for negotiation. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is at least $15,000. We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is better than my minimum, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we both can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $17,000. It's a good price and I'm happy to close the deal. It's better than my minimum and we're already halfway through the rounds."
