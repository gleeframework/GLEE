"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate a better price, but I'm afraid $9000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $12000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value of similar products.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $10800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into finding a mutually beneficial deal.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to pay $10800. I'm willing to meet you at $9800. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the effort I've put into finding a mutually beneficial deal.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this sale. I can offer you the product for $10500. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not willing to pay $10500. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, as I mentioned earlier. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value of similar products.",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to meet you at $10200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer.",10200.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not willing to pay $10200. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, as I've mentioned several times before. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value of similar products. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000.",9000.0,Bob,10,
