"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,600?  That's a fair middle ground, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,700. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,5,
