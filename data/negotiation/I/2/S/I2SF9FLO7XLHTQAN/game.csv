"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9000.  This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to accept your offer yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
