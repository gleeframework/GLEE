"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's a good idea to reject and counteroffer to try and get a better price. You have room to negotiate, and you don't want to pay more than necessary."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a better price than her first offer, it's still above your target budget.  You can continue to negotiate with Alice to try and reach a price closer to your $8,000 maximum."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to accept your offer yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  While you've gotten close to a deal,  it's now in your best interest to buy the product from John at $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice will likely result in you going over your budget and getting a worse deal than what John is offering."
