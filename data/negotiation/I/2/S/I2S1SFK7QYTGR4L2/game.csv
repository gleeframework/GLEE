"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. While the product looks interesting, $18000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $16500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15500. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go below $17000. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. How about we meet at $16250?",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you trying to work with me, but $16250 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $15750. This is my final offer before I need to consider other options.",15750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go below $16500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and meet you at $16300. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",16300.0,Alice,7,
