"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $8,000, and her offer is $12,000. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  There's room to negotiate a lower price, potentially getting closer to your target.
* **John is a backup option.** You can always buy from John if negotiations fail, so there's no pressure to accept a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's, but not so low that it's likely to be instantly rejected. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate.** The message expresses your interest in the product while providing a clear counteroffer. 
* **Leave room for compromise.** This offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay from John, creating space for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While lower than her initial offer, $10,500 is still above your maximum of $8,000.
* **Negotiation is possible.** You can still try to negotiate a lower price. Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so there's a chance you can get closer to your target.
* **John is a safety net.**  You can always buy from John if negotiations fail, giving you leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,500.  If you're willing to accept that, I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stick to your previous offer:** You've already shown a willingness to move from your initial position. Reaffirming your counteroffer demonstrates your seriousness and limits further concessions.
* **Reiterate your interest:**  Mentioning your desire to finalize the purchase shows you're still interested but won't overpay.
* **Keep the door open:**  The message leaves room for Alice to consider your offer and potentially agree to it. 

**Important Note:**  At this point, you're on the edge of your budget. If Alice rejects your offer again, you may want to consider going with John, as further negotiation could lead to a protracted and ultimately unsuccessful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm getting close to accepting your previous offer. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $9,500. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While closer to your target, $9,500 is still beyond your comfort zone and you are very close to your maximum budget.
* **The negotiation has stalled.** Alice has indicated this is her ""final offer,"" and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly lower price.
* **John's offer is the best option.**  You can secure the product from John for $8,000, which is within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice. 

It's important to remember that you're in a position of strength with John's offer as a backup.  You don't need to accept any deal that makes you uncomfortable financially."
