"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  How about $9,500?  I think that's a fair price, given what it's worth to me and still gives you a good profit."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This still gives you a significant discount from my original price and leaves me with a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $10,500 is a good price for him, and it's still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000."
