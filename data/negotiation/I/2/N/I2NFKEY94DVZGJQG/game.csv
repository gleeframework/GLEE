"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  How about $9,500?  I think that's a fair price, given what it's worth to me and still gives you a good profit.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This still gives you a significant discount from my original price and leaves me with a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
