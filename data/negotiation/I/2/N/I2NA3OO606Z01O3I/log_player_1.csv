"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is too low.  While $900,000 is better than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000), I can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have plenty of opportunity to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant discount. Let's work together to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That's closer, but still a bit high.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with a little more negotiation. I have 6 rounds left, so I have time to keep pushing for a higher price. Selling to John at this point would result in a lower profit than I could potentially get with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $1,025,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting closer.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair offer, and we both make a deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for me, as I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to him.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds. Additionally, selling to John would yield the same profit. Therefore, accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
