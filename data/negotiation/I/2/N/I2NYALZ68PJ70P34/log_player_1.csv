Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification for Value:**  While not revealing specifics, the message hints at the product's high value (""significant value,"" ""well worth the investment"") to make the higher price more palatable.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The message encourages a response from Bob, keeping the negotiation open rather than issuing an ultimatum.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging that Bob might reject the initial offer. If he does, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
