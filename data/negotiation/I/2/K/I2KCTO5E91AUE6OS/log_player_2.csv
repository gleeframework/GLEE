"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $800,000. Bob is still in a strong position to negotiate further as he can always purchase from John for his target price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm prepared to offer $825,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $837,500. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still above it.  Bob can still get the product from John for his target price, so there's no urgency to accept this offer.  Rejecting the offer allows for another round of negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $837,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $812,500. This is a good compromise and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $820,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above it. At this point, Bob has negotiated for several rounds, and with only a few rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will budge much further.  It's also important to note that Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John.  It's better to lock in the price with John and ensure he gets the product for his target price rather than risk getting a worse deal with Alice."
