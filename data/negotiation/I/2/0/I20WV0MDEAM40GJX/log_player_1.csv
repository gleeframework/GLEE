Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay a price higher than that. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting me closer to my ideal selling point. 
* **Balance Confidence and Appeal:**  Starting too high might scare Bob off, but starting too low leaves potential profit on the table. $140 strikes a balance, making it clear the product has significant value while still being enticing compared to Bob's perceived value of $80."
