{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's below my minimum price of $120, but allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'm ready to counter his offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $60 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum of $120. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
