"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and believe it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I believe the product has value, $825,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle at $750,000? That would work well for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
