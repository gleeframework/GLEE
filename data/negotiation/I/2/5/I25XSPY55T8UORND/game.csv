"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is still above your minimum value, and it leaves room for us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $850,000. While it's still below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
