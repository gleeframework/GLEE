Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is still above your minimum value, and it leaves room for us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
