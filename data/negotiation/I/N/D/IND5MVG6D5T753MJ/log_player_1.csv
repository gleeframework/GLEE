Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm looking to make a more significant saving. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

This is still a significant discount from your initial offer, but I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the product if we can agree on a price.
