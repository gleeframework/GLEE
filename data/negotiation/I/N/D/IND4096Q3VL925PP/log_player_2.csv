"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best course of action.  $50 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The goal is to save as much money as possible. While $45 is closer to your target of $40, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 42}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $43. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $43
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is currently at $43, which is very close to your target of $40. You've already rejected Alice's offer twice and it's unlikely she'll go any lower. It's best to accept this offer to avoid risking her getting frustrated and backing out of the deal.  You're still saving a significant amount of money compared to John's offer."
