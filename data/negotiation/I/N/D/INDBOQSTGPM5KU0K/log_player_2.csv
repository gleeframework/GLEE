"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay my full asking price. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message tries to create urgency, you have a better alternative. You know John will sell you the product for $800,000, which is your maximum price.  There's no need to pay $1,100,000 to Alice."
