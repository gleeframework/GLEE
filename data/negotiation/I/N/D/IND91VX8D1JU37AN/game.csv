"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120? This would be a great deal for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
