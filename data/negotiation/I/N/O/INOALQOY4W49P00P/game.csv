"Bob, I'm confident this product can be a game-changer for you, and I'd like to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential value. I'm asking $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product to you.  Consider the potential return on investment, and I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $950,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $975,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and will allow you to start realizing the value of this product immediately.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. Can we meet there?",980000.0,Bob,6,
