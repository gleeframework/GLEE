"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is still below my minimum, so I'll counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product to you.  Consider the potential return on investment, and I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a price closer to $1,000,000. While $950,000 is tempting, I think I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $950,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $975,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and will allow you to start realizing the value of this product immediately.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. Can we meet there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $980,000 is very close to my goal of $1,000,000 and is above my minimum of $800,000.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
