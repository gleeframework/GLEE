I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum while still being potentially attractive to Bob."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a fair compromise,  closer to my minimum price and hopefully enticing enough for Bob to accept."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk him walking away entirely.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $11,500."
