{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high, but also be willing to compromise.  I've chosen $11,000 as a good starting point, leaving a decent profit for me while still being potentially attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a little more. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is close enough to my desired price point.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on the deal entirely."
