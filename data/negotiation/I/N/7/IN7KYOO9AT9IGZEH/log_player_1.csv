Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value. It's important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so it's crucial to start high and be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer meets my minimum value, it's important to remember that I'm aiming to maximize my profit.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm offering $1,350,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer,  attempting to find a middle ground. It still exceeds my minimum value and gives Bob room to negotiate further if he's willing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum value, it makes more sense to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
