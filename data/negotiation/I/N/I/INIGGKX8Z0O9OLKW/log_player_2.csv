Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $130. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While closer to my budget, $130 is still a significant markup from John's offer of $100. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
