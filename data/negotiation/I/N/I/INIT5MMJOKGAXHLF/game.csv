"I'm interested in your product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,250. Can you consider that?",8250.0,Bob,4,
