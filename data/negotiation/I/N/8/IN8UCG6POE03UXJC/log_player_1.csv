{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that's above your minimum acceptable price ($100) but below Bob's perceived value ($150). It also leaves room for negotiation, suggesting flexibility and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a nice product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to get for the product. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite enough for me. How about we split the difference at $117.50?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $110? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's closer to your desired price point and still leaves you earning significantly more than you would by selling to John. It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
