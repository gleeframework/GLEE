Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's potential for him to negotiate a lower price, but still a price that benefits you.
* **It's competitive:** If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for $8,000, so you're not risking losing a substantial amount.
