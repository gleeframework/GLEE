"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I think it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $13,000**, which is still a better price than buying from John for $15,000.
* **There is a chance Alice might not accept a further counteroffer** (we already rejected her offer once). This means risking a deal with John. 
* **The $1,000 difference from Bob's ideal price is a reasonable compromise.** It's better to secure the product at a decent price than risk losing it altogether."
