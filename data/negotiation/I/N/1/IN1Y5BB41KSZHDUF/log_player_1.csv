Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is a good middle ground between my minimum value and what I think Bob is willing to pay. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? I'm suggesting $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $105?  This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's closer to what you're looking for."", ""product_price"": 105}
