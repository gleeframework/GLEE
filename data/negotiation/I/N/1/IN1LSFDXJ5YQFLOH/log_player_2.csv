Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $7,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, we're still significantly above her perceived value of the product ($8,000). There's room to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $7,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $7,000?"",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can offer the product to you for $7,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While we might be able to push her down another $50-$100, it's getting risky. Accepting at $7,250 secures a good price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through entirely."
