"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable.  Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but I'm hoping we can agree on a price that works better for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob.  While I understand your position, $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
