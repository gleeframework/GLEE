Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you don't sell below your minimum. 

I'm also being friendly and encouraging, hoping to build a positive relationship with Bob and make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to try to get closer to my target by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. Would you consider $11,000? This is still a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find some common ground!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I'm interested in purchasing the product, I'm still not able to go above $10,500. This feels like a fair compromise given the value of the product to me. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to compromise my own financial goals.  I'm better off selling to John and getting my full price."
