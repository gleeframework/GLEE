**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While we might be able to negotiate a bit more, $725,000 is a solid price considering the product's value to us ($1,500,000) and her starting point. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the negotiation breaking down or Alice becoming firmer in her stance."
