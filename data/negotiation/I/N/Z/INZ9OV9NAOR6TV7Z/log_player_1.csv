Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, especially considering its potential. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I know the product's value to Bob is $1,200,000, I start with a higher price ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and avoids any mention of the backup offer from John. This encourages Bob to engage without feeling pressured.
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know what you think"" signals willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both parties.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still securing a deal. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can gradually lower the price, knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000."
