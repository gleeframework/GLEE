,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. The product is a great one, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This reflects the product's worth while offering you a fair deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $11,500. How about we try $10,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,4,
