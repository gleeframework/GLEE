"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, Bob has a strong negotiating position. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay up to $15,000.  There's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the best deal possible while still keeping the possibility of buying from John as a backup. By offering $11,000, Bob demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but also shows that he values the product at a lower price than Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is higher than Bob's previous counteroffer and still above his target price.  However, Bob should still reject it. He knows that Alice is motivated to sell and that there's room for further negotiation. There are still several rounds remaining, and Bob can likely secure a better price if he continues to counter.  He shouldn't give in too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  He's still below Alice's offer, but by moving closer, he demonstrates a desire to reach an agreement. This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to find a middle ground, while still leaving Bob with a good buffer before he needs to consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, there's still some room to negotiate. Bob has 5 rounds remaining and should continue trying to lower the price.  He can still get a better deal than the current offer.  He doesn't want to rush into a deal and potentially regret it later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing continued commitment to reaching a deal. This counteroffer is a significant increase from his last one, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  It's also within his budget, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.  By offering $12,000, Bob is hoping to push Alice towards a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, there's still room to negotiate.  Bob has 3 rounds remaining. If he can get the price down to his target range ($11,000-$12,000), he'll save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing his commitment to reaching a deal.  He's getting closer to Alice's offer but still within his budget. This is a significant jump from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to get the best price.  With only two rounds remaining, Bob needs to make a strong final push to get the price down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round, and Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price range. Even though he's been able to get the price down somewhat, it's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate any further in just one round.  He's close to his maximum, and there's a risk of losing the product entirely. Buying from John is the safest option to guarantee he gets the product."
