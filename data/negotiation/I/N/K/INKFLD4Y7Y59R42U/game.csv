"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $10000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is the price I was initially willing to pay for the product from John. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
