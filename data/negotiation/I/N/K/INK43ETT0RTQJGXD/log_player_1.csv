{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120.  I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially open a negotiation. I'm keeping in mind John's offer as a backup if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet at $95? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can push it to $100. If not, I'll take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
