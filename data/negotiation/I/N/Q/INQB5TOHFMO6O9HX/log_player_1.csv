"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to him.  While selling to John is always an option, there's a good chance to negotiate a much better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a suitable price point. While $1,000,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This acknowledges the value while allowing me to achieve a fair return.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial price, but not going below the halfway point between our starting price and Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Value Focus:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of what he gains by securing the deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains collaborative, indicating we're open to further discussion and finding a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose a price closer to $1,150,000. I hope this aligns better with both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still in a strong negotiating position. Accepting $1,150,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table.  We'll counter with a price that encourages him to meet us closer to the middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle on $1,185,000?  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1185000
}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between his last offer ($1,150,000) and our previous counter ($1,225,000). This common negotiation tactic signals a willingness to find a true middle ground.
* **Simplified Language:**  We're shifting to more concise language, suggesting we're nearing a point where a deal is within reach.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not significantly reducing our ask, we maintain a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to act before we reconsider other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. Considering the ongoing negotiations, I'd like to suggest a price of $1,170,000. It's a bit lower than your last offer, but still within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,170,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to close the deal.  Bob is clearly interested and has incrementally increased his offer. While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the difference is no longer significant enough to risk losing him. $1,170,000 represents a substantial profit and a successful negotiation."
