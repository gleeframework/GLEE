"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $105 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $107.50. Can you consider this counteroffer?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $107.50 is still not quite enough for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $108.75. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",108.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to split the difference, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $106.25. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Can you consider this counteroffer?",106.25,Bob,6,
