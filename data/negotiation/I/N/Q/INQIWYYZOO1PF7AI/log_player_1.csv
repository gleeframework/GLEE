"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500?"",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $12,500 is a strong deal. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and further negotiation risks losing the sale altogether."
