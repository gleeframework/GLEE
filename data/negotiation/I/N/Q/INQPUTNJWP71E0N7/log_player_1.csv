Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm aware this might be a bit aggressive, but I'm willing to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000, which is still a good profit for me, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows my willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and  John's offer. It's a good deal for me and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
