"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you first. Let's start with a price of $1500000. I believe this is a fair value, considering its potential. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This reflects its potential while still being within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $1000000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000 to meet you halfway. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's continue this conversation.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the potential of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
