# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This reflects its potential while still being within my budget.  Let me know what you think.
