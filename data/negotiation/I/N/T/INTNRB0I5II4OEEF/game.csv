"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. ",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $950,000 is still too far below my desired range. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm asking for $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
