"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? That would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",12750.0,Alice,3,
