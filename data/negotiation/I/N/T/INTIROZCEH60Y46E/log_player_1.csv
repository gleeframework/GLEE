Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 9500} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price, but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you're confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  You can likely get closer to your target by counteroffering. You have leverage because Bob clearly values the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still higher. It shows you're willing to negotiate but also value your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,700 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While you'd prefer a higher price, continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away completely. Accepting his offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of ending up with $8,000 from John."
