Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $130? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
