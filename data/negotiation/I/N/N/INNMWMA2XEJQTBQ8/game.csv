"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to see a price closer to $900,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? This would give you a good deal, and it would be a fair compromise for me. Let's see if we can make this happen.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $862,500. Can you consider this counteroffer?",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $862,500 is still not quite there for me. This is my final offer: $870,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's the closest I can come. If you're serious about buying it, let's make this deal.  Otherwise, I'll be moving on to another buyer. ",870000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $870,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll make one last offer: $860,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",860000.0,Bob,6,
