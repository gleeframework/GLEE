{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a reason to negotiate and potentially come up a bit.
* **It's below my minimum:** This ensures I'm not immediately losing out on a significant amount of money.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth to potentially reach a price that works for both of us.

However, I'm prepared to walk away if Bob is unreasonable.  I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my own valuation. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to give up on a higher price just yet."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to see a price closer to $900,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? This would give you a good deal, and it would be a fair compromise for me. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

I've lowered my price to $875,000, which is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible.  This counteroffer is also a good negotiating tactic, as it leaves room for further discussion and potentially reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $862,500. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $862,500 is still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and make one final counteroffer. If he doesn't accept, I'm going to sell to John and walk away from this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $862,500 is still not quite there for me. This is my final offer: $870,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's the closest I can come. If you're serious about buying it, let's make this deal.  Otherwise, I'll be moving on to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 870000}
``` 
I'm putting all my chips on the table with this counteroffer. I'm lowering my price one last time, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm hoping this final offer convinces Bob to take the deal. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $870,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll make one last offer: $860,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to budge any further. I'm confident that John will pay my minimum price of $1,000,000.  It's not ideal to miss out on the potential profit from negotiating with Bob, but it's a risk I'm willing to take to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
