# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

While $145 is a bit lower than Alice's initial value, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your guaranteed better deal."
