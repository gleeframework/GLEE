"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I believe the product's value is worth more than your initial offer, and I'm willing to compromise, but not quite that low. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1800000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1800000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1550000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1650000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap this up today.",1650000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but $1650000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.",1600000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $1600000, Bob. I think we've been dancing around the price for a while now. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but this is my last one. I'll meet you at $1625000. If you're not willing to go higher than that, I'll have to consider other options.",1625000.0,Alice,9,
