"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000.  I'm confident this price reflects its worth and potential for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing $1,800,000. This reflects a willingness to compromise while recognizing the true value of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. Your understanding of the product's value is evident, and I respect your position. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this fairly reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're nearing a point where we need to make a decision.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It represents a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
