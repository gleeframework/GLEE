"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see all its benefits. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still far below what this product is worth.  I've considered your offer carefully, and I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it's a price I can live with. Remember, I'm also speaking with another buyer, John, who is eager to purchase this at a much higher price.  Let's make this deal happen before it's too late.

Alice has met your limit. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John, as both options will now cost you $1,000,000."
