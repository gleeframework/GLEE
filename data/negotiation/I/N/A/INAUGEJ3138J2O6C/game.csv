"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal right away if you agree.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see all its benefits. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I agree the product has value, my budget is firm. I could increase my offer slightly to $950,000.  If this works for you, I'm ready to finalize everything. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still far below what this product is worth.  I've considered your offer carefully, and I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it's a price I can live with. Remember, I'm also speaking with another buyer, John, who is eager to purchase this at a much higher price.  Let's make this deal happen before it's too late.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
