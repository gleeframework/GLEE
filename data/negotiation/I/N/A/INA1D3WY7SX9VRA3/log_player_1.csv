Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this to be a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice starts with a strong offer closer to her minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  Alice provides a reason for the high price, emphasizing the ""value and potential"". This subtly suggests Bob is getting a good deal.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation door open. 

**Strategy:**

Alice aims to secure a price as close to $1,100,000 as possible. If Bob rejects the offer, she has the security of John's guaranteed purchase at $1,200,000. This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while still offering Bob a chance to make a deal."
