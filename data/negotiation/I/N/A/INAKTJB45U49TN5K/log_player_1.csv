Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,500, so I'll offer $11,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price and see if I can close the deal without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,875?  It's a fair price that's closer to both of our desired amounts. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum that it's worth closing the deal with Bob.  It's also better than selling to John for $12,000."
