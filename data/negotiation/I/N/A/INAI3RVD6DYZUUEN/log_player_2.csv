"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $950,000 from Alice. You have a strong negotiating position because you can walk away and buy it from John for $1,200,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will counter-offer, but it gives you a good starting point for getting a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's closer to your ideal price.  You should reject the offer and try to get a lower price with another counteroffer.  You still have room to negotiate before you need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. It shows that you're serious about getting the product but still want a good deal.  Alice might accept it or counter-offer again, but you're moving closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum, and it's likely she will continue to hold out for a higher price.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point. Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees you'll get the product without further negotiation.  You can accept this loss, or you can try to find another seller but that will take more time."
