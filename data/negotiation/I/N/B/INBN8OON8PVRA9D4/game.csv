"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a way from what I have in mind. To move this forward, how about we consider $1,600,000? This reflects the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're right, we are getting close! I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To be frank, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we make this the final push – $1,250,000, and we have a deal?",1250000.0,Alice,7,
