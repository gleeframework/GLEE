Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are getting close! I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To be frank, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we make this the final push – $1,250,000, and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, she's unlikely to go below $1,250,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
