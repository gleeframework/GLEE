"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but my budget is quite limited. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $15,000? I'm willing to negotiate and find a fair price that suits both of us.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I'm not quite ready to sell for that price yet. I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This reflects the value of the product to me, and hopefully, it's also a fair price for you. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
