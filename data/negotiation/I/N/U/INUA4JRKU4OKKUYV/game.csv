"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10500. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $11200? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into this negotiation so far.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10800. I'm getting close to my budget, and I need to make a decision soon. Can you consider this offer?",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10800. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $11400? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into this negotiation so far.",11400.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final offer, and I'm willing to go up to $10900. This is my last offer, and I need you to consider it. If not, I'll have to walk away and consider buying from John for $10000.",10900.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that this is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10900. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $11600? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into this negotiation so far.",11600.0,Alice,9,
