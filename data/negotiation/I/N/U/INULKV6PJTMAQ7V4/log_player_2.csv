"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me. Would you consider $85?"", 
""product_price"": 85
}
```

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price and my maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Engaging:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is important. I want to encourage Alice to continue the conversation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $85, I'm aiming for a price that's beneficial for both of us. It's a significant saving for me while still offering Alice a reasonable profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit above $85. I can do $92, which is my best price for now. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, and $92 is a reasonable price, giving a good balance between saving money and ensuring I get the product. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially missing out on the deal."
