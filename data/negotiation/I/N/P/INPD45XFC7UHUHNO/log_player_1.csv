Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000."",
""product_price"": 1200000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that she has a guaranteed sale at that price.  Starting significantly higher ($1,200,000) allows room for negotiation while aiming for a much higher profit.
* **Confidence and Exclusivity:**  The language used aims to create a sense of value and desirability. By calling it an ""exclusive opportunity,"" Alice implies scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:**  The message briefly mentions ""value and potential"" to draw Bob's attention to the product's benefits beyond the price tag.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This offer assumes Alice has no prior information about how Bob negotiates. If Alice knew Bob was very price-sensitive, she might start lower.
* **Market Information:** If Alice had reason to believe the product's value might be even higher for Bob (due to unique market factors, for example), she might increase the price further.
* **Risk Tolerance:** Starting very high carries the risk of Bob walking away without counter-offering. Alice needs to be comfortable with the possibility of selling to John for her guaranteed $800,000."
