"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. While $875,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

We're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my budget caps out at $800,000 for this product.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer now matches John's offer. There's no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation with Bob at this point, as it's unlikely he'll go any higher. It's best to accept and avoid the risk of him lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
