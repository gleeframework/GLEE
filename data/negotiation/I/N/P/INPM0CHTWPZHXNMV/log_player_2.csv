"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $11,500, while John wants $12,000. 
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:**  Bob is willing to spend up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, Bob should accept Alice's offer to save $500 compared to buying from John."
