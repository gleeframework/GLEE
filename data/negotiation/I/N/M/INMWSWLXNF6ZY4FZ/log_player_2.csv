Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the middle ground, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my target. I can do $85, and I think that's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for.

Explanation: While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $80 in the remaining rounds.  You can get the product for your target price from John right now, so there's no need to risk further negotiation."
