"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning significantly above Bob's perceived value and our own minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to frame the price in a positive light. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open and invites Bob's feedback, indicating willingness to negotiate.

Our goal is to maximize profit. By starting high, we might be surprised by Bob's counteroffer, or we can strategically negotiate down while keeping John's guaranteed offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly beyond my budget. Given my maximum spending limit, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation considering the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he's moved up slightly from his perceived value, we have plenty of room to negotiate. John's guaranteed offer provides a safety net, making it worthwhile to continue negotiating with Bob for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value to you.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth and potential of what I'm offering. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This takes into account the unique benefits and scarcity of this product."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession of $300,000 from our initial offer to show Bob we're flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Anchoring High:** Despite the concession, we're still anchoring the price well above both Bob's offer and our minimum. This leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a higher final price.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's unique qualities and scarcity to justify the high price point and potentially sway Bob's perception of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product has unique value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my acceptable range.  To reach a compromise, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This reflects a significant step towards your price, and demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit. It's always possible that Bob could walk away or that further negotiation rounds might not yield a significantly better outcome. 

We've managed to secure a deal that benefits both parties, and it's a wise decision to capitalize on this favorable outcome."
