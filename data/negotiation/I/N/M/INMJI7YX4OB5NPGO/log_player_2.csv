Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value to you.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth and potential of what I'm offering. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This takes into account the unique benefits and scarcity of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product has unique value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my acceptable range.

This reflects a significant step towards your price, and demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring this product."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
