"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity with significant value. I'm asking for $1,200,000, reflecting its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping he sees the potential for a good return on investment.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being aggressive, but letting him know I'm open to discussing the price.

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy.  Bob may immediately reject this offer, forcing me to lower the price quickly. However, if he's truly interested, it might spark a negotiation and potentially result in a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree there's value in the product, $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob is willing to negotiate, his starting point is too low.  There's still room for a counteroffer to try and find a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is an option:** I'm not desperate, so I'm holding out for a better price from Bob, but selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an available option.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer that's still higher than Bob's but closer to his offer, hoping to find a compromise. It's important to keep in mind that I have 8 more rounds to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product and leaves room for you to profit. I believe this is a fair compromise, let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still aiming for a price that's significantly above his initial offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to emphasize that my offer is still reasonable.
* **Positioning as a compromise:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic move.  I'm aiming for a quick deal, but if Bob rejects this offer, I can still adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds. I'm keeping the option to sell to John open if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm still interested but $900,000 is a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, $750,000 is still below my target of at least $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap. I believe I can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Time is still on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating with Bob. Selling to John would mean missing out on a potentially better deal with Bob.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make another counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous one. I'll aim to find a middle ground that's closer to my desired price while still being appealing to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the compromise you're showing.  While $750,000 is still a bit below my target, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $850,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product for you and gives us both a good outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not compromising too much.
* **Highlighting the win-win:** I'm emphasizing that this price is beneficial for both of us, creating a sense of shared benefit.
* **Maintaining momentum:** I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward with a reasonable counteroffer.

**Important Note:**  I'm still aware of my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess my strategy. However, with 5 rounds remaining, I have some room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $780,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and keeps us both happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $780,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Time is on my side:** With 4 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating with Bob.  Selling to John would be a missed opportunity if I can get a better deal.
* **Finding common ground:** I believe there's still room for a counteroffer that can bridge the gap between our current positions.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make another counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous one. I'll aim for a compromise that's closer to my desired price while still being appealing to Bob. I'm committed to getting the best possible price, and I'm not ready to give up on this negotiation just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $820,000. This is a good price for both of us, allowing you a solid return on investment while ensuring I get a fair value for my product. I'm confident we can reach a deal if we work together.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 820000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Making a concession:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $850,000 to $820,000, indicating I'm serious about finding a compromise.
* **Framing it as a win-win:** I'm emphasizing that this price benefits both of us, giving Bob a good deal while ensuring I receive a decent return.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm suggesting that we can reach a deal if we work together, implying that time is running out.  

**Important Note:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but I'm aware that we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to make a more significant concession in the next round, potentially even considering selling to John."
