"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, to be honest. I really want to buy this product, but $11000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. My final offer is $8500. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you. Otherwise, I'm going to have to consider buying it from John for $8000.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one final offer: $8500. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to buy it from John for $8000.",8500.0,Bob,8,
