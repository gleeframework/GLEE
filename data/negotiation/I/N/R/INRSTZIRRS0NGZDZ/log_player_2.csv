"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1200000. It's a significant investment with tremendous potential, and I believe you'll see a strong return. This offer is valid for a limited time, so please consider it carefully. If you decline, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who values it at $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her asking price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product for $1,000,000 from John, saving $200,000."
