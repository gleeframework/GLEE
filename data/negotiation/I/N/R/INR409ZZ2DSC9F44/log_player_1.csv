Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows me to potentially maximize profit.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message highlights the product's value, justifying the high price without revealing my minimum.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves a small margin for Bob to counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive, keeping the door open for a deal above $15,000. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not mentioning John, I subtly imply scarcity and a potential loss of opportunity for Bob if he hesitates."
