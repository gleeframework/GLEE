"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, how about $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $6,500 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's make this deal happen!",8000.0,Alice,5,
