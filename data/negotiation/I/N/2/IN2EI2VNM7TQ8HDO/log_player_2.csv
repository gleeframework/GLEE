"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price closer to Alice's value of the product ($8,000) but still leaves some room for negotiation. This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still better than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob ideally wants a lower price, Alice has already rejected a lower offer and is closer to her minimum. Accepting this offer is a good balance of saving money and securing the product."
