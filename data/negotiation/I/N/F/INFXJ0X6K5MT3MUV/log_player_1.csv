Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I want to start with a significantly higher offer to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $10,000.
* **Risk assessment:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential gain from a higher selling price outweighs the risk of losing him as a buyer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while considering the value of the product to both myself and Bob."
