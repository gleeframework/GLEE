"I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to make a significant saving. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise further. I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. This is a more reasonable price point that still reflects the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer falls significantly below the product's true worth.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great asset to you.  My final offer is $1,350,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial ask and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
