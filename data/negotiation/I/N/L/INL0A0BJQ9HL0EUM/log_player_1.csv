Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing John guarantees $1,500,000, Alice starts high to maximize potential profit.
* **Slight negotiation room:** The offer leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures Alice a significant profit.
* **Justification of value:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"", Alice subtly anchors the price in Bob's mind against the perceived benefits. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In reality, multiple back-and-forth offers might occur before a deal is reached or rejected."
