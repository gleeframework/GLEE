{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a starting point that allows for some negotiation room. It's above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum acceptable price. 
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum, giving us space to negotiate.
* I'm keeping John as a backup option, allowing me to walk away from the deal if the negotiation doesn't work out. 
* My goal is to get as close to my minimum price as possible, ideally without losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me. I believe I can still negotiate with Bob and get closer to my desired price.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm not willing to settle for a price that is so far below my minimum, especially since I have John as a backup buyer.
* By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. 
* It's possible that Bob will raise his offer if he's genuinely interested in the product."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low. 
* **Message:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition of the product. I also acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but reiterate that my offer is still reasonable. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing interests:** This counteroffer seeks to find a middle ground while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining pressure:** By staying firm on a higher price, I'm putting pressure on Bob to raise his offer if he's truly interested in the product. 
* **Building rapport:** The friendly tone and emphasis on value helps to build rapport and keeps the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is the maximum I can afford. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer to potentially get closer to my desired price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher offer, but still too low:**  Bob's offer is an improvement, but it's not enough for me to accept. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $15,000 gives me the leverage to be more assertive in negotiations. 
* **Potential for compromise:**  I believe I can still convince Bob to raise his offer, or at least get him closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk tolerance:**  I'm willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,500, but I'm still unable to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,250.  This price is still a great deal for both of us, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $10,250, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate and meet him in the middle.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's increased offer but reiterate my minimum price. I'm emphasizing that this price is still a good deal for him, while also subtly suggesting that I'm not willing to go lower.

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  This counteroffer is a strong attempt at finding a final compromise, showing I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Staying firm:**  While offering a compromise, I'm not giving in entirely to Bob's initial low price. 
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making it clear that he's getting a good deal even at this price. 
* **Setting a deadline:**  By stating this is my absolute lowest price, I'm subtly implying a deadline for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $9,750. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not worth risking a deal with John, who is guaranteed to buy the product for a price that's far more favorable to me.

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed profit:**  John's offer ensures a significant profit margin, exceeding my minimum requirement and eliminating any risk associated with further negotiation.
* **Time is valuable:**  Further negotiation with Bob might take more time and energy, potentially delaying my earnings.
* **Potential for deadlock:**  It's possible that we could reach a stalemate with Bob, leaving me with no sale at all. 

**Conclusion:** 

Given the opportunity to secure a guaranteed sale with John at a price that meets my minimum requirement, I choose to sell the product to him."
