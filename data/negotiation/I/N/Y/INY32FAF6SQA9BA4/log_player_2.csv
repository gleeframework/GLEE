"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, you can likely do better. There's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer when you have room to negotiate and a backup option in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price of $11,000, but still leaves some room for Alice to profit. This counteroffer demonstrates your commitment to negotiating while showing that you are willing to pay a fair price. It also leaves room for future negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to your target, you're still within the realm of acceptable negotiation.  There's no need to rush into a decision, especially since you have the option of purchasing from John for a lower price.  You can attempt to squeeze out even more savings by rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate by rejecting Alice's offer of $10,000. This counteroffer of $9,500 is a compromise between your previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's most recent offer of $10,000.  This shows that you're serious about closing the deal while still attempting to secure a price closer to your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is only budging a small amount at a time.  At this point, $10,500 is still too high, and you've already shown your willingness to negotiate.  It's worth continuing to try and push for a lower price, especially since you have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a slight increase from your previous offer of $9,500, demonstrating that you are willing to compromise. However, it's still below Alice's offer of $10,500, showing that you are still pushing for a lower price. It's a calculated move to gauge Alice's willingness to meet you halfway, while keeping the option to purchase from John at $8,000 as a fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $10,250.  This is getting very close to your desired price range, and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and potentially making a counteroffer closer to her initial $12,000 increases.  

It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that is still within your budget.  The savings you get from purchasing from John at $8,000 are not worth the risk of a breakdown in negotiations and potentially being forced to pay a higher price from Alice."
