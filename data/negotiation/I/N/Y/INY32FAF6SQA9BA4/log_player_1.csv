"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still keeping it above Bob's offer.  I hope to find a middle ground where we both feel comfortable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a better offer than before, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to push for a higher price again.  I'm starting to feel a bit pressured by the time limit, so I'm going to try to be more assertive with my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly again.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit, I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see my commitment to getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, Bob will come around and agree to a price closer to my value. I'm also starting to consider the possibility of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm getting closer to a compromise, but I'm still holding firm to a price that feels fair to me. We are running out of time, so I want to find a solution that works for both of us."
