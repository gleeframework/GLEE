"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that aligns perfectly with your needs.  I'm confident it will be worth significantly more than the price I'm offering. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This represents a substantial gain for you, and it allows me to earn a fair price for this unique asset.  Let me know your thoughts.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options."
