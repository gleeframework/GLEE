"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
