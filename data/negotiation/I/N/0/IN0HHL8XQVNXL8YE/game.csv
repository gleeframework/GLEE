"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product but $100 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $85. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget, Alice.  How about $75?  That's a fair compromise between our two positions.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $75, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product for $90. It's a good compromise, considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",90.0,Alice,5,
