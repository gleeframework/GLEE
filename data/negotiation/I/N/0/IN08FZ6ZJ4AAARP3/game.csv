"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of offering $120 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
