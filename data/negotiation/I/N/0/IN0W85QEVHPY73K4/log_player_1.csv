Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $100 and leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $120, he has some room to bargain without losing value. This also allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer to $110. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 less than my last counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's time to accept the deal and close the sale."
