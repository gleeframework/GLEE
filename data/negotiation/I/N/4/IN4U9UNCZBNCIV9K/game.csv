"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1200000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is my best offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is your best offer, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $920000. This is my final compromise.",920000.0,Alice,5,
