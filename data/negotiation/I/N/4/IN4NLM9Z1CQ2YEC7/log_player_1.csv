Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and leaves room for Bob to still get a good deal ($500 in savings compared to his perceived value).  This strategy maximizes my chances of selling to Bob while still ensuring a substantial profit."
