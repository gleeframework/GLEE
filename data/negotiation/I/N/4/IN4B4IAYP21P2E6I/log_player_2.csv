"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $120 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $100, we're anchoring the negotiation closer to Alice's value.  Even if she doesn't accept, it gives us more room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation. 
* **Justification (Optional):** We could add a reason for our counteroffer (e.g., ""I've seen similar products in this price range""), but keeping it simple can be effective."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I can do $110, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great price for a product worth $150 to you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $110 is a reasonable compromise. We're saving $40 compared to John's offer, and Alice gets a profit.
* **Limited Time/Options:**  We don't know if Alice will go any lower, and further negotiation might not yield much more savings. It's better to secure a good deal now."
