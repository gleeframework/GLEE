Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. To make this attractive for you, I'm willing to offer it at $900,000. This is a limited-time offer as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering at $900,000 is significantly lower than your value ($1,000,000) but still a substantial profit margin. It's also considerably higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

This strategy aims to find a sweet spot where Bob sees value and makes a deal, letting you exceed your guaranteed sale price with John."
