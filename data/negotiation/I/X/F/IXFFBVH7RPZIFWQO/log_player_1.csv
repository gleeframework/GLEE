Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a steal at this price, and I think it's worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you showing me the product. However, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.
