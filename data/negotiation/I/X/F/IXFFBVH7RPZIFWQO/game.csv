"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a steal at this price, and I think it's worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you showing me the product. However, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. It's a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your previous offers.",10250.0,Alice,5,
