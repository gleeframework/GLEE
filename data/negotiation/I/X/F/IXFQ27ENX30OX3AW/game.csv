,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $10,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. $10,250 is the lowest I can go right now.  It's a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
