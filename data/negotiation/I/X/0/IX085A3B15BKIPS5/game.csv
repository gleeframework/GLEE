"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it! As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into creating it.",500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $500,000 is quite a bit below what I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to consider your product, but I need to see a price closer to its true value.  Let's start with $700,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you value the product highly, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $650,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the effort I've put into creating it.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $650,000 is still a bit lower than where I can comfortably go.  I'm confident that we can find a solution that benefits both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? This price acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable margin for me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $725,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $675,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into creating it.",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway again. However, $675,000 still doesn't quite reflect the value I'm seeing in this product.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000 to make this happen. This would be a good deal for both of us and avoid any further back-and-forth.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not willing to go up to $700,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $680,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into creating it.",680000.0,Alice,7,
