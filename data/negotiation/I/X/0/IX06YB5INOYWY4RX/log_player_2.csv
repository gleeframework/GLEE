The offer from Alice is way too high. It makes more sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get a good discount.  $7,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still potentially within a range where we could find common ground."

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to reject and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $7,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but still want a good deal. I'm hoping to find a middle ground."

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but $9,500 is still more than I want to pay. I'm going to keep negotiating."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm going all in with my target price of $8,000.  It's the maximum I'm willing to pay, and if Alice rejects, I'll buy from John."
