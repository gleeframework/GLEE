"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price significantly higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my target.
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer and keep the negotiation going. 
* **Leaving Room:** This initial offer leaves me with 9 rounds to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** While Bob's offer is closer to my target, I still have room to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and try to secure a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to push towards my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to recoup some of my costs. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 for the product. This still leaves you with a great deal and allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can agree on this!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still being firm on my value.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a good deal for him, even at this price. 
* **Positive Tone:** A positive tone maintains a collaborative atmosphere, encouraging further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm using a gradual approach to negotiate. This keeps Bob engaged and potentially incentivizes him to accept a price closer to my target with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still not able to meet your price. I would like to propose $925,000 for the product. I hope this is within your range and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to secure a price closer to $1,200,000. Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Time is Limited:**  We are now in Round 4, meaning we have fewer rounds remaining to reach a more favorable deal.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price and potentially close the deal in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to push towards my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $940,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll find very attractive. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** I'm again offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly emphasizing the importance of reaching an agreement by using phrases like ""close this deal"". 
* **Maintaining Optimism:**  A positive tone and optimistic language encourage Bob to see the value in continuing negotiations.

**Strategy:**

This is a crucial round, as we are nearing the midpoint of the negotiations. By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, I'm showing that I'm serious about reaching a deal but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price too far below my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still not able to meet your price. I would like to propose $930,000 for the product. I hope this is within your range and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** While Bob's offer is closer to my goal, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are now in Round 6, leaving us with only 4 rounds to reach a more favorable deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but there is still a chance to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  However, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob increases with each round.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to push towards my target price while acknowledging the time constraint."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $935,000 for the product.  This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's work together to close this out."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll receive.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using phrases like ""close this out"" to subtly suggest that we need to reach an agreement soon.

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly higher price and emphasizing the value, I'm hoping to convince Bob to accept the offer and close the deal.  However, I'm also aware that we're approaching the end of the negotiation, so I need to be prepared to either accept a lower price or move on to John if Bob doesn't come to the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $927,500 for the product. I hope this is a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $927,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $927,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are now in Round 8, leaving us with only 2 rounds left. The risk of not reaching a deal with Bob increases significantly.
* **Low Offer:** Bob's offer is still far below my minimum, and there's a high chance he won't budge much further.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,200,000. It's a safe and certain outcome.

**Decision:**

It's time to secure a guaranteed profit and move on to John.  While I would prefer to reach a higher price with Bob, the risk of not reaching a deal at all is too high at this point."
