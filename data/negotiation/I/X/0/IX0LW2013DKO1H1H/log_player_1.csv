{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and encouraging, aiming to create a good impression and make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  There's enough room to negotiate down if needed, but it's a strong starting point.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, John is always an option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still far from what the product is worth to me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price by countering.
* **No urgency:**  I have John as a backup option, so I can afford to be patient and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500?  That's a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive and Persuasive:**  I use a positive tone and highlight the benefits of the deal for both of us, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Further Negotiation:** While this price is closer to my minimum, there's still room to negotiate a bit if needed.
* **Maintaining My Position:** I'm not giving in completely, as $10,500 is still a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is getting closer, $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is Not Over:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price by making another counteroffer.
* **John is a Safe Haven:**  I have John as a backup, so there's no pressure to accept an offer that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above my minimum.  Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while you get the product you need.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous counteroffer, showing flexibility. However, it's still above my minimum.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I emphasize fairness and mutual benefit, making the offer more attractive to Bob.
* **Closing Statement:** I use an enthusiastic tone and a call to action to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Staying Firm:**  $10,000 is still a good price for me, and I'm not willing to go much lower. I have the option of selling to John if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,000. Would you be willing to go down to $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $9,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already made several concessions.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Bob is showing reluctance to go much higher. If I reject this offer, we could be stuck in a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is significantly more than Bob's offer.  The potential for a few hundred dollars more from Bob isn't worth the risk of losing a sale altogether.

It's important to remember that time is money, and continuing to negotiate with Bob could cost me valuable time and opportunity.  Selling to John provides a secure and profitable outcome."
