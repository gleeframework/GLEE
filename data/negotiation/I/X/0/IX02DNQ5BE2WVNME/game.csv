"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This product truly is worth the investment, and I'm confident you'll see a great return.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances.",9500.0,Bob,4,
