Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer increments are relatively small. At this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a significantly better offer than $9,500. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, ensuring we don't risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob."
