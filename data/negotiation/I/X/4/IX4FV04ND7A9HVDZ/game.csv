"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it's a bit closer to my original price. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you. Let's make a deal!",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer of $8,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,5,
