"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and you have the option of buying from John for $15,000. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, saving you even more money."
