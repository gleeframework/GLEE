"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800000.  If you're open to that range, we can work out a deal. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price is $800000, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
