"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price. It's unlikely Alice will sell for her minimum of $1,000,000 right away, so there's potential for both parties to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  If you're open to that range, we can work out a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price is $800000, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. At $850,000, the deal is still significantly better than buying from John for $1,000,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price without risking further negotiation that might not yield a better result."
