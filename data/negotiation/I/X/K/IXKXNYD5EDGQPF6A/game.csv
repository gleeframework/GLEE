"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12000.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $18000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the discount, $18000 is still more than I can afford. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.  How about $15000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having a good conversation. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go below $17000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still beyond my budget. To be completely honest, I'm seriously considering buying from John at $12000. However, I'd rather work with you if possible. Is there any way you can come down to $14000? It would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're considering buying from John, but I'd rather we work together. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $17000. How about we discuss a price of $16000? This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,7,
