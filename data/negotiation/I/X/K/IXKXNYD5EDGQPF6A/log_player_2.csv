"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $25000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $18000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $18,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and seeing if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the discount, $18,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.  How about $15,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having a good conversation. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go below $17000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $17,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $12,000. It's worth trying to push for a lower price one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still beyond my budget. To be completely honest, I'm seriously considering buying from John at $12,000. However, I'd rather work with you if possible. Is there any way you can come down to $14,000? It would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're considering buying from John, but I'd rather we work together. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $17000. How about we discuss a price of $16000? This is a compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above your budget of $12,000, and you've already reached round 7.  At this point, it's better to go with the guaranteed deal from John.  You've negotiated as much as you can with Alice and continuing to negotiate might not be worth the time, as you have a limited number of rounds."
