"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome, knowing Bob values the product higher. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm being friendly and engaging to build rapport. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion. This makes it less likely he'll reject the offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $80 for the item. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $80 is my minimum, I believe I can get more with further negotiation. 
* **Opportunity to improve:** Bob has shown interest, and I have more rounds to explore a higher price. 
* **Staying firm:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm serious about getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $90? This would still give you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway, but still above my minimum.
* **Empathy:** I acknowledge Bob's budget and reiterate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize that $90 still provides a good deal for Bob. 
* **Clear Expectations:** I'm being firm but open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, could we aim for $85? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in Round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, it's risky to continue negotiating.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the potential for a breakdown in negotiations or Bob walking away altogether is high. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit, minimizing the risk of ending up with nothing."
