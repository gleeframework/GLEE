"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However,  $9,000 is a significant difference from what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,000?  This price reflects the true worth of this product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $9,000. This product is valuable to me, and I'm confident this price reflects that.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
