"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's too risky to accept at this point.  Bob should reject and counteroffer, aiming to get the price down closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Strong:** Bob needs to show Alice he's serious about buying but also firm on his budget.  He's not going to just accept her first offer. 
* **Realistic Offer:**  $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's starting price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Bob emphasizes the value he sees in the product, showing Alice he's not just throwing out a random number."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However,  $9,000 is a significant difference from what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,000?  This price reflects the true worth of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting and counteroffering again is the best strategy.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can aim for a price closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $9,000. This product is valuable to me, and I'm confident this price reflects that.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Polite:** Bob reiterates his previous offer but remains polite and avoids getting into a debate about the ""true worth"" of the product.
* **Show Confidence:** By stating he's confident the price reflects the value, Bob implies that he's not just randomly throwing out numbers and is willing to stand by his offer.
* **Focus on Agreement:**  He emphasizes finding ""common ground,"" suggesting he's open to finding a compromise."
