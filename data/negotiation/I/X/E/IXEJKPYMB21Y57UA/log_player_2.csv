Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still not comfortable with the price of $725,000. We're willing to consider a counteroffer of $850,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and unique features. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, but we're still above John's offer. There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your flexibility. To make this work for me, I can do $775,000.  What do you say?"",
 ""product_price"": 775000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're inching closer to John's price while still leaving some room for a potential final counteroffer from Alice. This approach keeps the negotiation active while aiming for the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're still not comfortable with the price of $775,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer, signaling she may not be willing to go much lower. It's unlikely we'll secure a price significantly better than John's offer at this point.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed price from John."
