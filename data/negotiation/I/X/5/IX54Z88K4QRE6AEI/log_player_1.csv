Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also trying to build a bit of rapport by highlighting the product's value and mentioning a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $115 to make this work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $115, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his price point. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price.  I'm also reiterating my appreciation for his interest, which helps maintain a positive tone in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $112 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to go that low.  It's important to stick to my minimum price point, and John is offering me my minimum.  Selling to John will ensure I get the best possible price, and saves me further negotiation with Bob."
