"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my limit. I'm thinking $1,300,000 is a fair price for this product. Can we meet at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I still need to be mindful of the value this product represents.  How about we settle at $1,375,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1375000.0,Alice,5,,
