Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still maximizing my potential profit. I'm confident that Bob will be interested, given the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. How about we try $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle on $940,000?  This compromise represents a significant step closer to your desired price while still allowing me to achieve a profitable outcome.  Let's close this deal now!"", ""product_price"": 940000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing my minimum price, but it's getting risky.  Time is running out and we're not making substantial progress. I'm not confident I can secure a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
