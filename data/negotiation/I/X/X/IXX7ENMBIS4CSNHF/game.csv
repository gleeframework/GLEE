"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $13,000 is a fair price, I could be persuaded to come down to $11,500.  This product offers significant value, and I believe this price reflects that.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
