Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely worth the price you're asking, but I'm not quite ready to go that high. Let's start with $1,200,000 and see if we can find some common ground. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,200,000, and I still have rounds to negotiate."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  While $1,300,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit stretched at that price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm confident we can finalize this quickly if we agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
