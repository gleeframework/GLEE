"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $14,500. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $14,500. How about we try $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $13,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $14,000. It's closer to your offer and gives you a great deal on a product you value at $10,000.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. I'm willing to go up to $13,750, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",13750.0,Bob,6,
