"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value and I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. However, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, you give yourself a chance to negotiate a better price with her. She might be willing to go lower, especially since she values the product significantly less than your offer."
