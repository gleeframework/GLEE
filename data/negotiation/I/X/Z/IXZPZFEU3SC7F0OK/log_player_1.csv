"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit above my minimum.  This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000, I'm holding out for more. I'm confident I can get a better price through continued negotiation or by selling to John."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer again and see if I can push for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell to him at this price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While it's tempting to try one more round, I'm not sure I can get a higher price from Bob. It's safer to take John's offer and secure a profit."
