"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Is this something you'd like to consider?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be interested in taking it for that price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. How about we add a small premium to the price, and I'll sell it to you for $115? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",115.0,Alice,5,
