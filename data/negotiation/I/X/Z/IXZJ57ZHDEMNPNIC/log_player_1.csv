"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $9,500. It's a fair price considering its value, and it gives you a great deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500** is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob and frames the price as a ""fair deal.""
* This strategy aims to get a quick agreement while ensuring you receive a substantial portion of the product's worth to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a higher price. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm still in a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you value the product at $8,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $9,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* I'm reiterating my own value for the product, highlighting the compromise I'm offering.
* I'm proposing a price of $9,000, which is still above my minimum threshold and closer to my initial offer.
* This strategy continues the negotiation process while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Although $8,800 is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still not acceptable.  I'm only halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget. It's a fair deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm acknowledging Bob's financial limitations while reiterating the product's value.
* I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $9,000 to $9,200, but it's still above my minimum threshold.
* I'm framing the offer as a fair deal that benefits both of us, emphasizing mutual gain.

This strategy continues to push Bob towards my desired price point while demonstrating flexibility and maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,100, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $9,500,  $9,100 is a good compromise. I've reached the halfway point of the negotiation and Bob has shown a willingness to meet me closer to my desired price.  Accepting the offer secures a decent profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiation rounds where Bob might become less willing to compromise.  Furthermore,  selling to John would only yield $10,000,  which is only slightly better than this offer."
