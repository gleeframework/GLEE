"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $9,500. It's a fair price considering its value, and it gives you a great deal. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you value the product at $8,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $9,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget. It's a fair deal that benefits both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,100, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9100.0,Bob,6,
