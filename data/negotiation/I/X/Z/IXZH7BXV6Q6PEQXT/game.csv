"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price of $14000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I have to consider the value the product holds for me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13200. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for me.",13200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I need you to come down to that price. I'm willing to make a deal at this point, but I need it to be a good one for me.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm not willing to go any lower than $13200. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 6-month warranty and a comprehensive maintenance package, which will add significant value to the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the added value. I'm sticking with $13200.",13200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the added value you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, and I'll consider the extras you're offering as part of the deal. I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $13000, but I need you to agree to a 3-month maintenance contract, which will ensure the product continues to perform optimally. I believe this is a fair price considering the added value. I'm sticking with $13000.",13000.0,Alice,9,
