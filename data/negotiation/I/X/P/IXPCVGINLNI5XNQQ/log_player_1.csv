""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,600,000. This is a fair reflection of its worth and future returns."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer.  While we could try to negotiate with Bob further, there's no guarantee of reaching a higher price. Accepting John's offer ensures we get our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) without the risk of further negotiation."
