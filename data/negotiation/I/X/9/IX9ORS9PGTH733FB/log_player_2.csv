"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $15,000 to you, and you have the option to buy from John for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can reject it and still get the product for the same price from John."
