"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $115?  ",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a good price for you, and it's the lowest I can go.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I can afford.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
