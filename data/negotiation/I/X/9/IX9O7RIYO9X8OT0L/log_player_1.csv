Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without you feeling forced to accept a price lower than your minimum. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your business, $85 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $95?  This is a great deal for a product that you'll find really valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92.50 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $92.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $93.75.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 93.75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $93.75 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, but no higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll consider buying from John for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $90 is still below my minimum price of $120.  Although I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, it's better to sell to John for $120 and ensure I get my minimum price."
