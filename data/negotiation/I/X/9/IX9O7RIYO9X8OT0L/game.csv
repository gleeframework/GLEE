"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your business, $85 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $95?  This is a great deal for a product that you'll find really valuable. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Would you be willing to accept that price?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $92.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $93.75.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your decision.",93.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $93.75 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, but no higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll consider buying from John for $80.",90.0,Bob,6,
