"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1250000? This price acknowledges your needs while still allowing me to profit from the sale.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1100000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1150000.  This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
