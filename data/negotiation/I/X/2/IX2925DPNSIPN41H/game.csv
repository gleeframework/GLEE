"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target.
