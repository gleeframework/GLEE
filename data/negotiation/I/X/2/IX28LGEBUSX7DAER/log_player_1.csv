Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring I make a significant profit if he accepts. 
* **Guaranteed Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 gives me a strong fallback position. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
