Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good profit. I'm also factoring in that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to close this deal immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close enough to my desired price point that I'm willing to accept it. It's better than my minimum and is still a good profit.  While I could try to squeeze out another $500, I don't want to risk him walking away and leaving me with only John's offer."
