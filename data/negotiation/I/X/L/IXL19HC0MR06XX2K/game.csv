"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're making a compromise, Alice, and $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
