"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $17,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer of $17,500 is significantly higher than both your $10,000 limit and John's offer of $10,000.  It makes the most sense to go with John's offer."
