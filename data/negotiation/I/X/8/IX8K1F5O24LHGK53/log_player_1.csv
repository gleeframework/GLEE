Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. What do you think?"",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While John guarantees $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering it at $1,200,000 or more guarantees Bob will reject it. Offering it at $800,000 or less undervalues the product.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant profit margin for Alice while still potentially enticing to Bob as it's considerably less than its worth to him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed to encourage negotiation. If Bob counters, Alice can adjust and still likely land a price higher than John's offer."
