"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  Since Alice is willing to sell for $800,000, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, Bob can likely get a price closer to his ideal $850,000 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  $875,000 feels like a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $875,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's becoming risky to continue. If Bob rejects this offer and makes another counteroffer, there's a chance Alice will simply walk away, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $75,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous option at this point."
