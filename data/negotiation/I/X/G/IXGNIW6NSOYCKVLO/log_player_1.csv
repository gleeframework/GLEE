Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * **Bob's Perspective:** He gets the product for $150,000 less than its worth to him ($1,000,000 value - $1,150,000 price = $150,000 gain).
    * **Your Perspective:** You earn $150,000 more than selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

**Important Note:** This assumes you're comfortable with a potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you'd need to decide if you're willing to go lower or stick to John's guaranteed offer."
