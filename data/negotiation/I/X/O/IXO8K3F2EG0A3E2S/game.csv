"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is a significant concession, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand this is your lowest price, but it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
