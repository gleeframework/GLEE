"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high asking price, even though it's above Bob's known valuation.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  By stating ""I am open to discussing this further,"" I signal willingness to negotiate and avoid immediately shutting down the conversation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts my initial high offer, I achieve the best possible outcome.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response (acceptance, rejection, or counteroffer) will provide valuable information about his willingness to pay. 
3. **Maintain Control:**  I set the initial bargaining anchor, influencing the direction of the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value of $1,000,000. This indicates a strong interest in the product and a willingness to negotiate. While accepting would yield a profit, I believe there's room for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer but remain engaged in the negotiation. By continuing, I can try to:

* **Close the Gap:**  Aim for a price closer to my initial offer, potentially above $2,000,000.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Remind Bob of the product's unique value and my alternative option with John. 

I'll craft a counteroffer that balances firmness on price with a willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,800,000 is still significantly below my initial assessment of the product's value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This reflects the product's unique capabilities and the potential return on investment it offers. "",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Controlled Concession:**  I lowered my asking price by $150,000, demonstrating movement and a willingness to compromise.
* **Holding Firm:**  The counteroffer of $2,100,000 remains significantly above Bob's initial offer and closer to my target range.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reiterates the product's unique value and potential ROI, justifying the price point.

By making a significant but not drastic concession, I aim to:

* **Encourage Reciprocity:**  I hope to incentivize Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer in the next round.
* **Maintain Momentum:** I want to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Avoid Stalemate:**  I'm mindful of the limited rounds and the potential need to walk away to secure a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. Considering your initial offer was $2,250,000 and you're now at $2,100,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $2,025,000. This is my best and final offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $2,025,000 is very close to my target price range and represents a substantial profit over both my minimum and his initial valuation.  Here's why accepting is the best strategy:

* **Strong Profit:**  $2,025,000 is a significant gain, exceeding my minimum by $525,000.
* **""Best and Final"" Signal:** Bob's language suggests he's unlikely to go higher, making further negotiation risky.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation and potential delays. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I *might* be able to extract a slightly higher price, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of Bob walking away or my needing to settle for John's offer later. 

This acceptance demonstrates a balance of firmness and flexibility, ultimately securing a very favorable outcome in the negotiation."
