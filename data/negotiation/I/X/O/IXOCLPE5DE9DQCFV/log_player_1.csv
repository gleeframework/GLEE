Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also shows my willingness to negotiate. What are your thoughts?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
