"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also shows my willingness to negotiate. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. Would you be willing to consider $2,100,000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, but $2,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,950,000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to listen to your thoughts.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
