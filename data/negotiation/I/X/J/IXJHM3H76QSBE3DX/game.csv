"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price of $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can consider.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. That's the maximum I can go. Can you consider that?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
