Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've described. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can potentially get more from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1275000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being mindful of my budget.

Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is close to my minimum price of $1,200,000, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly better offer from him. It's also more than what John is offering.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
