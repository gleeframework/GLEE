"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a fair price, and I get a strong return on my investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more like $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's a fair price that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to propose $925,000. Can you consider that?",925000.0,Bob,4,
