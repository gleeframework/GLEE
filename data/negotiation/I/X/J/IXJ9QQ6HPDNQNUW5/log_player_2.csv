"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and understanding your perspective on the value it brings.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, $2,300,000 is way beyond my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. I believe this represents a fair starting point for us to negotiate from."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit from your initial offer, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I can do $950,000.  I need to be mindful of my budget.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground.  To be frank, $1,500,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a final offer, as I already have another buyer at this price.  I believe the product's value justifies this, but I value our discussions and want to give you the first opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her bottom line is $1,500,000. This is above your maximum budget and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
