"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and understanding your perspective on the value it brings.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, $2,300,000 is way beyond my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. I believe this represents a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit from your initial offer, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I can do $950,000.  I need to be mindful of my budget.  Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground.  To be frank, $1,500,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a final offer, as I already have another buyer at this price.  I believe the product's value justifies this, but I value our discussions and want to give you the first opportunity.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
