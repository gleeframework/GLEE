Alice's offer is too high, and you are willing to spend no more than $12,000. Therefore, it's better to reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a better price."
