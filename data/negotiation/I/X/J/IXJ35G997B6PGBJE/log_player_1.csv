{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, but it gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. It also shows confidence in the product's value, potentially making Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $7500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500. That's a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $8500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $8250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
