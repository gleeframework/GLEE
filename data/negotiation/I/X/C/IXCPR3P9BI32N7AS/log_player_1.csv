Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially going higher than $15,000.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message positions the price as ""fair"" while acknowledging the product's value to Bob. This encourages a positive response. 

**Why not higher?** Starting too high (close to $15,000) might immediately discourage Bob without giving you a chance to negotiate.

**Why not lower?**  You have leverage with John as a backup buyer, so there's no need to undervalue the product significantly."
