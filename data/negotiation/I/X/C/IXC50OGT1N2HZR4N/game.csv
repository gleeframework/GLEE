"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The value of this product is significant, and I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair price considering the product's potential. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
