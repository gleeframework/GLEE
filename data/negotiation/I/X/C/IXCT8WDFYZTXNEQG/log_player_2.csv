"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,200,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely do better.  He should counteroffer to see if he can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $950,000 is a better price than her initial offer, Bob can likely still get it for a lower price.  He should counteroffer again to see if he can close the gap."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $800,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $800,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Considering the value you'll get from the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's gotten the price down to $875,000, which is a significant discount from the initial $1,200,000.  While he could try to counteroffer again, it's unlikely he'll get a better price. It's better to secure the product at a good price rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
