"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price is right.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $800,000. I think this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident that this product will be a great investment for me. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $800,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Considering the value you'll get from the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
