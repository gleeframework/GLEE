Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your position. In light of the value you see in this product and to further explore the possibility of a successful collaboration, I would like to propose an adjusted price of $975,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly, but it's still above my ideal price point.  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $900,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get Alice to budge further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your valuation of the product. To continue our dialogue, I am proposing a price of $925,000 for the product. This figure reflects a compromise between our respective positions, aiming to ensure that we both receive a fair return. I am committed to finding a solution that satisfies both parties and would be delighted to discuss this proposal further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is within my budget and represents a significant compromise from her previous offers. It's likely that she's unwilling to go lower, and I risk losing the deal if I continue to reject her offers. While I would prefer to pay closer to my initial counteroffer, accepting this offer secures the product and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
