"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exclusive product to you for $9500. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the option open for negotiation with Alice or allows Bob to look for other potential sellers."
