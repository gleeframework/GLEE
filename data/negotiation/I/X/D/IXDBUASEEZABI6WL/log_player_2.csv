(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since my maximum budget is $1,200,000, I'm starting with a counteroffer at that price. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it establishes my clear boundary and opens the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her first one, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice, hoping to get a better price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,300,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within a reasonable range. I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within my budget, and while it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might get me a slightly better price, but it risks losing the deal altogether.  Since I have a backup option with John, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice at this point."
