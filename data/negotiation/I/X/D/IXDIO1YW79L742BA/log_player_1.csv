"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think you'll find it very useful. I'm asking for $200 to start."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to a better agreement. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $150 matches my minimum acceptable price, I know John is ready to buy at that price immediately. There's no guarantee Bob will go higher in further rounds, and I risk losing both offers if I continue negotiating. It makes the most sense to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
