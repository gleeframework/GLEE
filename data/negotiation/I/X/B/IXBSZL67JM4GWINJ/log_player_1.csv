""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers incredible value, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price with John incentivizes Bob to buy.
* **Urgency:**  By implying the product's value, I create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

It's a gamble, but if Bob values the product even slightly more than $12,000, he might be willing to pay the higher price to secure it."
