Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000, as I know its value is quite high. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $15,000 (Bob's maximum) might make him hesitant or feel like he's not getting any deal.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing John will buy it for $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out completely."
