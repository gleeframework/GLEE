Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit above the $12,000 fallback option (John).
* **Confident but not Aggressive:** The message aims to be persuasive without being overly aggressive, acknowledging the product's value to Bob."
