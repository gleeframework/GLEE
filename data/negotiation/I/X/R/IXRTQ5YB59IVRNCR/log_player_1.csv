**Reasoning:**

Bob is bluffing. He's trying to pressure me by mentioning John and a lower price, but his actions throughout the negotiation show he values the product significantly higher than $1,000,000.  It's unlikely he'll find a similar deal elsewhere. 

Continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point is risky. He's shown a strong reluctance to move substantially from his offer. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a significant sum compared to John's guaranteed offer. 

Therefore, the most logical decision is to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, ensuring I receive the product's minimum value to me."
