,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9800. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $10200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've made concessions and offered you a price that's very close to my minimum value. I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle on this one. However, I'm willing to make one final offer. I'm counteroffering at $10500 again, but this time it's firm. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to go all the way to $11250. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,9,
