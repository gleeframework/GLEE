"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate while still making a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe there's still potential to get a higher price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, and with only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
