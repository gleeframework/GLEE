"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is $15,000. It's too high, so Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, starting with a counteroffer of $10,000 is a good strategy. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and shows Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It's likely Alice will counter with a higher price, but this sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target of $12,000. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate and is clearly aiming for a price closer to his target. This counteroffer is a compromise, slightly higher than his initial offer but still lower than Alice's current offer. This increases the chances of Alice accepting the offer, especially if she's keen to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500. While this is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his target of $12,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a slightly better price. The risk of going to John is still present, but the likelihood of closing a deal with Alice is high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. This counteroffer is a strong compromise, offering a price that's very close to Alice's last offer but still lower than her desired price. It shows Bob's willingness to meet her halfway and increases the likelihood of her accepting the offer.  Alice is likely to accept this offer, as it's only a small difference from her last offer, but it still gets Bob closer to his target."
