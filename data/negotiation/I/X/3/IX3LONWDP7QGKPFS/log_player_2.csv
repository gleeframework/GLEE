"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to start the price at $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to signal that you're looking for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. This shows Alice you're serious about a lower price point.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer allows space for Alice to counter and for you to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message maintains a respectful tone while clearly stating your price expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $14,000 is still significantly higher than both your target price and the price John is offering.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice explicitly stated her willingness to negotiate, indicating she might be open to further price reductions.
* **Alternative Option:** You have the security of John's offer, allowing you to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I could potentially go up to $7,000, but that's the absolute most I'm willing to spend."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** Increasing the offer to $7,000 shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but remain firm on a reasonable price.
* **Setting a Limit:** Clearly stating $7,000 as your maximum reinforces your budget constraints and manages Alice's expectations.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** Keeping the offer below John's price keeps the pressure on Alice to make a more competitive offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to drop to $12,000, which is the very lowest I can go for this product.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by declaring a ""final offer."" This doesn't necessarily mean it's her true bottom line.
* **Still Above John's Price:**  Even at $12,000, you'd be paying significantly more than what John offers. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  You have several rounds left, and Alice might be bluffing to try and close the deal quickly.  There's still room to negotiate a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, and I respect that. However, $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This offer stands for the next two rounds. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise with a Condition:** You're acknowledging Alice's position but standing firm on your need for a lower price. Offering a $9,000 compromise shows a willingness to move closer.
* **Introducing a Deadline:** Giving the offer a two-round deadline creates a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to respond more quickly.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $9,000 is a strong position â€“ a significant saving from Alice's offer while still exceeding John's price. It allows room for further negotiation if needed."
