# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $11,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting closer to your budget limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal for Bob.  He's getting the product for significantly less than his maximum budget and for less than what John is offering. Holding out for a lower price might not be worth the risk of Alice retracting her offer."
