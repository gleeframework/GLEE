"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $11,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, my budget limit is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to accept $10,000 for the product?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're getting closer to your budget limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
