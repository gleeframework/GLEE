"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $65 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even less by negotiating with Alice.  There's no harm in seeing if you can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $55 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected. This gives you room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $60, which is a good deal considering your maximum budget is $80.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next offer and you'll end up buying from John at $80.  It's better to secure the product for a price you're comfortable with."
