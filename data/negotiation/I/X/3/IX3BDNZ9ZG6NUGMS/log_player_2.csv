Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but  $1,175,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on price, she's still significantly above your backup option of John at $1,200,000.  There's no guarantee Alice will go lower than $1,250,000, and continuing the negotiation has a risk.  It's a better decision to secure the product from John at your target price."
