"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. Considering the value of the product to you and the discussions we've had, I am prepared to meet you halfway. Therefore, I am offering to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is only $25,000 over your maximum budget of $800,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price.  Accepting Alice's offer allows you to secure the product while still keeping your expenses relatively close to your target."
