"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum value I'm willing to spend on this product.  Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer of $800,000. However, I would like to propose a compromise that reflects the value I place on the transaction. Would it be acceptable to us to agree upon a price of $850,000? I believe this would be fair for both parties involved.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $800,000.  It's the maximum I can spend on this product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. Considering the value of the product to you and the discussions we've had, I am prepared to meet you halfway. Therefore, I am offering to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
