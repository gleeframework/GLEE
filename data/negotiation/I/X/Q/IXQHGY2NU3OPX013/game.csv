"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will lead to a successful deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,280,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
