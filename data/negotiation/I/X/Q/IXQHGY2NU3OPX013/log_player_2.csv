"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good starting point, there's room for negotiation to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price, and getting it for $1,300,000 is still better than buying from John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will lead to a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,280,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is a good price, significantly lower than John's offer, and it's a positive step in the negotiation.  Further negotiation might save a little more, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
