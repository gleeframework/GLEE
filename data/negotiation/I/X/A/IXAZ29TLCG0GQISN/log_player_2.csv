"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $90 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it!  While I'm interested in the product, $90 is a little out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $87.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $87.50 is less than Bob's maximum of $100.
* **A good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject a lower offer.  It's likely John would offer a similar price if Bob rejects Alice's offer again.

Accepting the offer gives Bob a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the product."
