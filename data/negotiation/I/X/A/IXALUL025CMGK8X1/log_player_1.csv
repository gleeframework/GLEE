Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget.  Given my research and what I'm willing to pay, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. I'm eager to work with you to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my price point. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, so it makes the most financial sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
