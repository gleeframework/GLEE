"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $2,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential I see in using it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,750,000. This price reflects the immense value it will bring to your business in the long run.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  However, I need to be upfront - $1,500,000 is the absolute lowest I can go for this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will deliver significant returns for you at that price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
