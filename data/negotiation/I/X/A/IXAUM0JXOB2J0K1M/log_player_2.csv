"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I've put considerable thought into a fair starting price of $2,000,000. What are your initial thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's highly unlikely this is the best you can do. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $2,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential I see in using it."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,750,000. This price reflects the immense value it will bring to your business in the long run. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $1,750,000 is still significantly higher than your alternative option with John. Continuing to negotiate is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, and I do see its potential. However, to make this work for me, I need to stay within a certain budget.  Would you consider $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  However, I need to be upfront - $1,500,000 is the absolute lowest I can go for this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will deliver significant returns for you at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has revealed her bottom line at $1,500,000.  Since this is above your maximum price and you have a standing offer from John at $1,200,000, it makes the most sense to buy from John. Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better deal for you."
