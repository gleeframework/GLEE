"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer gives you the chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good compromise and still below your maximum price of $150.  Accepting the offer saves you time and gets you the product you want at a reasonable price."
