Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a good starting point since Bob values the product at $150. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially increase the price further if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Avoiding the John alternative:**  $120 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, so I'm not immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my starting price of $120 and leaves less room for me to earn more.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.  Bob has already shown interest, indicating he's willing to pay more than John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a higher price:** $110 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to adjust for a better deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm not immediately accepting Bob's offer, which shows I still have leverage in the negotiation."
