``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still being profitable for me.  It also establishes a clear value point for the product.  I'm interested in seeing what Bob's response will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than the $10,000 from John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000.  I will counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $15,000.  $12,500 is a decent offer, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I will counter again, but I'll need to be careful not to push Bob away entirely."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $12,800 is only $200 away from my counter-offer of $13,000. This is a good deal, especially compared to selling to John for $10,000.  It's time to close the deal."
