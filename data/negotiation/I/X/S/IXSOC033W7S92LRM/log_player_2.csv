"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I understand it's worth a bit less to you, but this price allows for a good deal for both of us. If you're not interested, I have another buyer who's willing to pay full price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
