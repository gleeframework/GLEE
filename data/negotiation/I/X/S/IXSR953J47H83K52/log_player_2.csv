"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $20,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product, but I'm not sure it's worth more than that to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $17000, but I think the product is worth more than that to you. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. You're still hoping to get the product for closer to your $10,000 counteroffer. Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find some common ground. I'm prepared to offer $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll need to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is your maximum, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is a $1000 reduction from my previous offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. While she has shown a willingness to negotiate, it's clear that you're unlikely to get the product for your desired price.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $12,000 to ensure you secure the product within your budget."
