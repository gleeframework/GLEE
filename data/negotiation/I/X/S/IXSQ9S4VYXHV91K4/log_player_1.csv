{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you and a significant profit for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's $800,000 valuation, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below my minimum:** This ensures I'm still getting a profit significantly higher than my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **It's a good starting point:** This price allows for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than his initial valuation, it's still far below my desired price. I need to hold out for a better deal. Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more profitable agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Meet Bob halfway:**  It's a compromise from my initial offer and closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still leave profit:**  It's significantly above Bob's valuation and provides a profit for me.
* **Open the door for a deal:**  It provides a clear price point that could potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $975,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is a tempting offer, it's still far below my desired price and significantly lower than what I can get from John.  I need to hold out for a better offer. I'll reject this offer and see if I can convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a final compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and ensures we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Be a final compromise:** It's the last concession I'm willing to make.
* **Still provide a decent profit:**  It's well above Bob's initial valuation and gives me a significant profit.
* **Emphasize finality:** The message makes it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept."
