Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still being a significant profit for me. I'm confident that if he rejects this offer, he'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer. I'll need to be careful not to push him away, though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves a good profit margin for me. I'm hoping this is enough to entice Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to make a final counteroffer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This time, I'm going to sell to John. I've already made a counteroffer, and Bob's last offer is still lower than what I'd like. I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with him altogether.  Selling to John guarantees me a fair price, and I'm comfortable with that."
