Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more. If he rejects the offer, I can always sell it to John for $120, so there's no risk for me."
