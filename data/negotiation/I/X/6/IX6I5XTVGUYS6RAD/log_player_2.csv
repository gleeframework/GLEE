# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've shown interest in. I'm offering it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her value for the product, you know you can get a better deal from John for $100.  Since your goal is to save money and the product is only worth $100 to you, buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
