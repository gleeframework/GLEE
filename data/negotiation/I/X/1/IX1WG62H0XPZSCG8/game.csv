"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While $22,000 is my initial asking price, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I could potentially stretch my budget to $13,000. Would that be acceptable?",13000.0,Bob,6,
