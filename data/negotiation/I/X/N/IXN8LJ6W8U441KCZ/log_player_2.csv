"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's target of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for counteroffers and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to $1,000,000 as possible. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for Alice to negotiate. Bob is demonstrating his willingness to negotiate and potentially reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within Bob's budget, and it's a reasonable compromise. While Bob could potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the deal falling apart is high.  At this point, accepting the offer is a safe and practical choice to secure the product."
