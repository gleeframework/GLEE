"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $16,000 for this product.  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal! ",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $15,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $14,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,6,
