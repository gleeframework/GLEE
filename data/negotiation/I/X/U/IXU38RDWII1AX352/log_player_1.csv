{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value for the product, but still lower than your minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, and also leaves you some room to come down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you're interested.  I'm happy to come down a bit, but I'm not able to go as low as $90. How about $100? That's still a great price for the product, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $95 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  But I can't go lower than $105.  That's a fair compromise, and it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
