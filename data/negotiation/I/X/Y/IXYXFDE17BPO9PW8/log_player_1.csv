Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), giving me room to negotiate. I'm also trying to build rapport by expressing confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm trying to meet halfway by offering $11,500, which is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also reminding him of the product's value to try and convince him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my ideal price but it's above my minimum value of $12,000. It's a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $12,000."
