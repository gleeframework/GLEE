Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150), hoping to leverage Bob's potential interest.  However, I'm aware this might be too high for him.  If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value ($120) and  gets me closer to my minimum ($150), it's still below what I consider fair. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering a price slightly higher than his offer but still lower than my initial asking price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but also aims to secure a sale that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now just below what I'm willing to sell for.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target of $150,  it's the best deal on the table and ensures a sale. There's no guarantee that another counteroffer from Bob will be higher, and there's always the risk of him walking away.  It's time to secure a sale."
