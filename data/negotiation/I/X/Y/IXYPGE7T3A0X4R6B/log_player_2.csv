# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to your maximum price, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have room to bargain, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get a lower price. It's a risk, but the potential savings are worth it."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $960000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $965000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $965,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $965,000 is only $5,000 more than my last counteroffer.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to get me a significantly lower price.  It's likely Alice is firm on her offer, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to accept and secure the product, even at a slightly higher price, than risk missing out and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
