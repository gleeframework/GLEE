Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, I have a strict budget. I can do $9,000, and that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has indicated that $9,000 is his final offer. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll move significantly higher. Accepting his offer nets a lower profit than John's guaranteed $10,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure a sure sale with John."
