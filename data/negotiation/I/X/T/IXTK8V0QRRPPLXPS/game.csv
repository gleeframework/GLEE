,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the deal, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $95 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $105 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $100 for the product?  It's the most I can afford, and I'm confident I'll enjoy using it.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $102. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",102.0,Alice,5,
