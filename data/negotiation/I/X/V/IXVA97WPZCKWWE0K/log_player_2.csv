Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, which is just a small concession from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is right:**  $9,100 is a significant savings compared to John's $10,000 price.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  She's already made several concessions.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation window. Risking it further might force us to buy from John at full price."
