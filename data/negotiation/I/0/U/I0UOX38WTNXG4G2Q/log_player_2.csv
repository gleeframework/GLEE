"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $18,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000. It's much smarter to counteroffer Alice or just buy from John."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  He should counteroffer again or buy from John."
