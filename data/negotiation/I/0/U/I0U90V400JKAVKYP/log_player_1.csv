Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its inherent value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. This is a time-sensitive offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can afford to start high. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value to justify the high price, even though we haven't explicitly revealed Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer without overthinking or trying to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Negotiation is likely to occur. We've left room to potentially decrease the price, but ideally not below $1,500,000."
