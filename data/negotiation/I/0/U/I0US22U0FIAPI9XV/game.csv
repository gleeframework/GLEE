"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still too high. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  That's a fair price considering I could buy it elsewhere for $8,000.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",9000.0,Alice,5,
