"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for $8,000.  There's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer.  While $10,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can get the product from John for $8,000, making Alice's offer unattractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still too high. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  That's a fair price considering I could buy it elsewhere for $8,000.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  While $9,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He has a guaranteed deal with John at $8,000, and he's already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down any further."
