"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I am offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,000,000.  I'm willing to make this deal happen for $1,900,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price significantly.  You can get the product for much less from John."
