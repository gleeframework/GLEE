"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's the highest I can go.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is quite high, and $85 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we settle at $90? It's a fair compromise.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this final offer - $88.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think $88 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $89. Can you meet me at this price?",89.0,Bob,6,
