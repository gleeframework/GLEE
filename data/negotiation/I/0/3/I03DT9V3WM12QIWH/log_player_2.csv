"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No immediate benefit to accepting:**  Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no immediate gain in accepting.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Rejecting allows for potential negotiation and a lower price.
* **Risk assessment:**  Buying from John is always an option, but it's best to explore negotiation first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  Starting with a significant discount (20%) shows my seriousness about negotiating and puts pressure on Alice.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $8,000 is still within my budget, making it a reasonable starting point.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
