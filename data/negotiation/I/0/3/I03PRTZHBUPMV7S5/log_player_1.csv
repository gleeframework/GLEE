"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  The message frames the high price as justified by the ""potential"" of the product, subtly suggesting it might be worth even more than Bob realizes.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's perspective, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his counteroffer is discouraging, it suggests he's interested.  I'll use the next round to try and bring the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value it holds and leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but firmly state that it's too low.
* **Significant Drop:**  I lower my price by $200,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate but maintaining a strong stance.
* **Justification:**  I re-emphasize the product's value while framing the new price as a win-win opportunity. 

By making a significant price reduction but staying well above both his offer and my minimum, I aim to guide the negotiation toward a more realistic range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a price point that works for both of us. While I appreciate the reduction,  $1,400,000 is still too high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above his perceived value of the product and represents a reasonable profit for me. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk of Bob walking away if I keep negotiating. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal without risking the deal falling through."
