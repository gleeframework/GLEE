Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value it holds and leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.
