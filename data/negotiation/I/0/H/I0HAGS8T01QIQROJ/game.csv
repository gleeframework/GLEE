"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset for you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $9,000 is too far below what I need to get for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $10,000. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position. I can go a bit higher, but $10,500 is still a stretch for me.  Would you consider $9,500? That's the maximum I can offer at the moment.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $9,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $10,000.  That's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,
