"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, I think $1,200,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to show my commitment to this deal. This price still offers significant value for your business, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'd need to be closer to $950,000 to make this work. Would that be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $975,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement in this round.",975000.0,Alice,5,
