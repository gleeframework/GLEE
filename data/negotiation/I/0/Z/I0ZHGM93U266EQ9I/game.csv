"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still giving me a great product at a price I can afford.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's closer to the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $1175000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm seeing if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $1125000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm not willing to go any lower than this. This is a compromise, but I think it's the best we can do. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
