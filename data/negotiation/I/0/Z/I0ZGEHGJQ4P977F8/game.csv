"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to acquire a product that I value while remaining within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. Considering your willingness to pay $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you, while also being a bit more reasonable than my initial offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This price accurately reflects the value I place on the product while allowing me to stay within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $950,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a bit more reasonable than my initial offer. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
