Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,500 is better than her initial offer, it's still more than what he can get from John.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and I'm willing to consider your suggestion. In light of this, I propose a price of $9,000 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice's offer of $9,000 is lower than her previous offers, it's still higher than what John is offering. It's unlikely that Bob can negotiate a better price with Alice, so he should go with the sure thing and buy from John."
