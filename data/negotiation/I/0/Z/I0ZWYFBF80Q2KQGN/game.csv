"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be extremely valuable to your business. I understand you're likely to have your own assessment of its worth, but I'm confident it's worth significantly more than the price I'm offering. I'm asking for $2000000. This is a price I've carefully considered, taking into account both the product's value and my own needs. I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair offer.  Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
