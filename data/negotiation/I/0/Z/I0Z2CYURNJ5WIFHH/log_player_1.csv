{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming higher initially allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 gives you space to negotiate down if Bob shows resistance, potentially settling closer to his $8,000 perceived value. 
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer before a wider release can make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal and encourage a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and any counter-offers he makes."
