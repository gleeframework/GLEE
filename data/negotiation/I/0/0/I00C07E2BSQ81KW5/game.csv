"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that my initial price was a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm confident you'll find it's worth that price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $100? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $100 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This is my final offer, as I know I can sell it for a similar price elsewhere.",125.0,Alice,5,
