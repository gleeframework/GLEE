{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a range that might be appealing to him.  I want to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable value ($150) while still being competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. It's not worth accepting. I will counteroffer him with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $140. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable value, but it's getting closer.  Since I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from him or if I'll be able to sell it to John, it's best to accept his offer to avoid potentially losing out on a sale."
