"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
