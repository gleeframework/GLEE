I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? It's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $8,200 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a good deal.  Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a better price in the remaining rounds.  It's time to close the deal!"
