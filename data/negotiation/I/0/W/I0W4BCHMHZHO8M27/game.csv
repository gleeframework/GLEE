"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay at this point.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
