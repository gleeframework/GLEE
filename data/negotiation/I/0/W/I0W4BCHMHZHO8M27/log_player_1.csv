Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think.
