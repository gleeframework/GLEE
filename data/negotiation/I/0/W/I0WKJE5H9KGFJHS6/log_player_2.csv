"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $100. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a good price, it's still more than Bob's ideal value of $120. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $90. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $95 is closer to his ideal value, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's not desperate, and there are still rounds left to bargain."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $92.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
