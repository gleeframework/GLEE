"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's a unique opportunity that I believe aligns perfectly with your needs and interests. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm extending this exclusive offer to you at a special price of $12,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its market value is around $10,000 to you, and it's significantly less than the $15,000 offered by alternative buyers. I trust this proposal will meet your expectations and provide you with the exceptional experience you're looking for. Let me know if you have any questions or need further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the market value to Bob, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to get the product for his maximum budget of $10,000."
