"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $15000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9000, which is a reasonable price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's still a great price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,
