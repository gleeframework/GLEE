"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $15000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his $8,000 limit. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a reasonable price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's still a great price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice has continued to be inflexible, and $10,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While there's still time to negotiate, it seems unlikely Alice will come down to a price Bob is comfortable with.  It's better to secure the product from John and avoid further potential delays and frustration."
