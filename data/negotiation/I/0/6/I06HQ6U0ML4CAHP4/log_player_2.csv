"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  It's better to see if Alice is willing to come down in price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, aiming to show that I'm serious about getting a better price.  It's still above Alice's value for the product, leaving room for negotiation.  However, it also leaves me room to potentially increase my offer if necessary.  I'm hopeful that this will entice Alice to counter at a price more agreeable to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I'd like to pay, and it's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price.  Even though it's closer to my ideal price than her first offer, I'm not yet ready to commit, especially since I've already shown that I'm willing to walk away.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer than my last one, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This will demonstrate my continued commitment to negotiation while still aiming for a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000 for this product. It's a fair price that benefits us both and lets us close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step towards Alice's offer, demonstrating that I'm seriously considering buying the product.  It's also my maximum offer, but I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me in the middle at this price since it's still above her own valuation. I'm hopeful this will be a strong enough offer to convince Alice to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise, and it's getting closer to my desired price.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm starting to run out of rounds.  The risk of going to John and paying $1,200,000 is too high at this point.  Accepting this offer will allow me to acquire the product for a good price and avoid the higher cost from John."
