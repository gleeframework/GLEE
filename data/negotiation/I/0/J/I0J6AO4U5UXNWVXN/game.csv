"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my valuation and your stated value. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?  This accounts for both our valuations.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $1,400,000. This price is closer to my initial valuation and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I'm motivated to find a solution,  $1,400,000  falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  My final offer is $1,525,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and a fair offer considering its true value.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting close.  $1,525,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise.  This allows for a good profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
