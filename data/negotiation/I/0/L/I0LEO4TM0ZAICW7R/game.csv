"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe its value to you is significant. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair return for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me and the potential for a long-term partnership, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This allows for a healthy margin for you while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I can accept right now. To find a price that works for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.  This offers you a significant value, and it's still within a reasonable range for me.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
