"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe its value to you is significant. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair return for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower than $1,400,000, as she values the product at $1,000,000."

Considering the value to me and the potential for a long-term partnership, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This allows for a healthy margin for you while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I can accept right now. To find a price that works for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.  This offers you a significant value, and it's still within a reasonable range for me.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,400,000.  It's also lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $200,000 compared to buying from John. While there's a possibility of getting a lower price through further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it for a potential small gain."
