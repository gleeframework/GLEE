"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can't afford $9,500 for the product. Could you consider lowering the price to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm open to $9,000. This would still be a great price for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than its value to you.  Let's meet in the middle!",9000.0,Alice,3,
