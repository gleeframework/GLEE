Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer meets my minimum price, and I'm happy to sell to him. There's no point in risking a further negotiation with him, since I can always sell to John for the same price."
