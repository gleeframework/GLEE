"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, I believe the product's value is higher than your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $12,000. It's the product's value to me, and I'm not willing to go higher. If you're open to that price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look at other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
