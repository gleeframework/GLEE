"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $750000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $800000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price I can comfortably work with.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $900000, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $20000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the added value, but the price is still a bit out of my reach. While I recognize the service is worth $20000, it doesn't fully offset the difference. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price I can comfortably work with. ",850000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're close to reaching a deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $900000, but this time I'll throw in an additional service worth $30000 on top of the previous offer. This brings the total value to $930000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, while the additional service is valuable, $900000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference again and go with $875000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make it work within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925000, but I'll also throw in the two services we've discussed earlier, worth a total of $50000. This brings the total value to $975000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,9,
