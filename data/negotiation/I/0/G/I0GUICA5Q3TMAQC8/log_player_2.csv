"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code

```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I agree this product is valuable, the price point of $12,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $6,000. I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:While Alice is moving closer to my budget, $9,000 is still more than I want to spend, especially when I can get it for $8,000 from John. I'll try to negotiate a bit further down."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my current budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000?  That would make this a viable purchase for me."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:Alice is now only slightly above John's price.  It's not worth further negotiation and potential failure to secure the deal. John offers a sure thing at my target price."")
