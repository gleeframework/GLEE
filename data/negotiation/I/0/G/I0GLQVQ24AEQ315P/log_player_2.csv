Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is significantly lower than my starting price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $850,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you.  $750,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the product's true value.  Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

This is a good time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her bottom line:** She's stated that $800,000 is her final offer and the minimum she'll accept.  
* **You're getting a good deal:** You're buying the product for $200,000 less than John's offer and at the lowest price Alice is likely to go. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  Pushing for a lower price might make Alice walk away, leaving you to buy from John at a higher price."
