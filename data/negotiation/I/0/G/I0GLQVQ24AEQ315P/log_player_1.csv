Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It's better to keep negotiating with him or to sell to John."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is significantly lower than my starting price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $850,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with him or considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you.  $750,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the product's true value.  Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 800000}
