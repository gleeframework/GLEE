Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to maximize your profit by aiming higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant portion of the potential profit ($2,000). 
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so starting at $14,000 makes it likely he'll see it as a good deal and potentially accept outright. 

This approach balances risk and reward, giving you the best chance to get the highest possible price from Bob."
