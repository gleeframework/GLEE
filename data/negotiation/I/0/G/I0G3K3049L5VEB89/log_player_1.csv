Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($9,500) allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Time Value & Alternative Option:** While John offers a safety net at $8,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly at a higher price is preferable. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's exact valuation of $10,000. In a real negotiation, gathering information about the buyer's perceived value is crucial."
