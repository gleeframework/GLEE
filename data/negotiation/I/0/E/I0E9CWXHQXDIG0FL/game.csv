"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given my budget constraints.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to secure the product while still staying within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  While I value your interest, the product's worth is closer to my initial offer.  I could consider $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price given the value this product offers.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
