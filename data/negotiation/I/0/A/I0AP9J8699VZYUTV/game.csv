"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but the price is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
