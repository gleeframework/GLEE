# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,100,000, and you have a guaranteed option for $1,000,000 with John. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
