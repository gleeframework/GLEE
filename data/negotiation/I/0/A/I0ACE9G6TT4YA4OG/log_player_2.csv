"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds significant value to me. Considering its importance and the potential it has to benefit you, I am offering it to you at a special price. For a limited time only, you can purchase this item for $12000. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure a valuable asset at a price that is higher than what you perceive its worth but lower than my personal valuation. I believe this offer presents a mutually beneficial arrangement. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
