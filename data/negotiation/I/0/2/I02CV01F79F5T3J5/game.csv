"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  My asking price is $1,250,000.  This represents a significant savings for you compared to the value you've placed on the product.  Please consider this offer carefully, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it at a higher price.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
