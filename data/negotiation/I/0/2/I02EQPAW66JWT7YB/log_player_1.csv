Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to create a sense of urgency. I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response and keep an eye on the $800,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $800000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept. While I'd love to get more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. John is offering me a guaranteed $800,000, which is the best I can do at this point."
