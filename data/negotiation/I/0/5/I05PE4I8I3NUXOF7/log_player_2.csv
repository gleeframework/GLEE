"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that will surely bring you value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $20,000.  This is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm only able to pay up to $15,000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're a savvy buyer, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $16,500? This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $16,500 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $17,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above Bob's budget.  It's still worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a lower price, especially since Bob has the option to buy from John for $15,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my reach.  To find a middle ground, I'm offering $16,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $16,250, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $16,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially getting into a stalemate, especially with John offering the product at a price that Bob can afford. Buying from John is the most financially advantageous choice in this situation."
