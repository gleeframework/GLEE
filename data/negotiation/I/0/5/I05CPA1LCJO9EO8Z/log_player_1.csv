"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that the product is worth more to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I'm also aware of the value of the product to me, and I won't go below $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my starting offer and there is room to negotiate. I'll try to close the gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is a significant decrease from my original offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also signals to Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but that I won't give away the product for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial price point, Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and it's likely that the negotiation will go lower from here. It's also only round 4, so I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less."
