"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's not worth paying $12,000 for a product worth $10,000 to you. You should try to negotiate with Alice first."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At $11,000, you're still getting a good deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. It's a better price than John's offer and closer to your initial counteroffer."
