"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm open to negotiations. However, I do need to make a profit, so I'll start with a price of $1,100,000.

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $1,100,000 is still too high."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
