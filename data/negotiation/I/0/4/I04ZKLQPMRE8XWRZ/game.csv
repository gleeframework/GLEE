"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $10,500 is still a little steep for me. Would you be willing to settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
