"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price for a product that's worth $12,000 to you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $11,250? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you want to make a profit, but $11,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $10,500 is closer than before. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. How about $11,000? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and lets us both get a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
