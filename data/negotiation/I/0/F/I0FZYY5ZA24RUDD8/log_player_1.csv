Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. I know that's a significant investment, but I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the benefits, it hints at them, encouraging Bob to consider the value proposition beyond the price tag.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest level.  If he flat-out rejects it, Alice knows he's highly price-sensitive and she has John as a backup. If he counters, it opens up negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** The message assumes Bob might be swayed by perceived value and the exclusivity of being offered the product first. If Alice knows Bob to be extremely price-conscious, a different approach might be needed.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Alice should be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. She has a good margin to work with, but she needs to balance concessions with maximizing her profit."
