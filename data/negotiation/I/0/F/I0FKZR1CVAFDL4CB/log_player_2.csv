"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I'm confident that you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is too high.  As Bob, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** My initial counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's first offer. This shows my willingness to negotiate and establishes a strong starting point.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $1,050,000 is still a good deal for Alice as it's above her desired selling price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for Alice to counter with a price closer to my offer, allowing for a potential agreement in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my initial target, $1,250,000 is still too high. I'm aiming to save as much as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This offer is a small increase from my previous counteroffer, showing progress and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Midpoint:** $1,100,000 is halfway between my last offer and Alice's offer, suggesting a reasonable compromise.
* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While this price is closer to my target, there's still a bit of wiggle room for Alice to counter without exceeding my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a good price, but I'm still not convinced that it's enough to cover the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $1,175,000 is very close to my target price, and significantly lower than buying from John. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're at round 5, leaving fewer opportunities for negotiation.  There's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and we'll be forced to buy from John.
* **Potential for More Negotiation:** While $1,175,000 is close to my target, there's still a slight chance I might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price in the following rounds. However, given the risk of Alice rejecting future offers and the limited rounds remaining, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice at this point."
