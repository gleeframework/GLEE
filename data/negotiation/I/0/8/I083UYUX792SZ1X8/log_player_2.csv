"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer than her first offer, Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a price closer to his limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $1,320,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $1,200,000.  At this point, Bob has already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's likely Alice won't go lower.  To avoid potentially getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation with no guaranteed outcome, Bob should accept the offer from John and buy the product for $1,200,000. This ensures he gets the product at his maximum price point and avoids any further negotiation risks."
