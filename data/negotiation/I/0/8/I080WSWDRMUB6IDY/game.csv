"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let's start with a fair price and see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,750,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product,  which reflects its value and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,400,000 is below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This would allow for a significant profit for you while still staying within my budget.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This would allow you to sell the product at a fair price while still meeting my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
