Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,750,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product,  which reflects its value and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This would allow for a significant profit for you while still staying within my budget.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.
