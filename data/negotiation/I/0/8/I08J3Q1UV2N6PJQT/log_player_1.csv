{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **High starting point:** It's a bold opening that leaves room for negotiation but still reflects the product's high value.
* **Appeal to Bob's interest:**  The message directly addresses Bob's potential gain, making it less likely he'll immediately reject the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** It sets the stage for further negotiation if Bob counteroffers.

Remember, this is just the initial offer.  I'm ready to adjust based on Bob's response and keep the negotiation moving towards the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better. Bob clearly sees the value in this product, and rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives me leverage to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the substantial value of the product and gives you a significant return on your investment.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original proposal. Given the value I place on the product, I am unable to agree to a price higher than $950000. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident that I can push for a higher price. We've already established that the product is worth more to Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1 million.  By rejecting his offer and making another counteroffer, I can see if he's willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still firm on the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's a price that still offers a substantial profit for you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Based on the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a final offer of $1000000. This is my best possible offer, given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my minimum.  It's a significant profit for me and also allows me to keep the negotiation going with Bob.  I'll accept his offer and move forward."
