,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a very fair price considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant amount and reflects the value I see in this product.  This is my final offer. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
