"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $10,000. This saves you $2,000.
* **While the product's value to Alice is $8,000**, that's not relevant to your decision. You are focused on getting the best deal for yourself."
