Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to start high. This allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to lower the price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"", you are framing the product as highly desirable and valuable.
* **Open for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in a discussion about the price, leaving room for potential negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal."
