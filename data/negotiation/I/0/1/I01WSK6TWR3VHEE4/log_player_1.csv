"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This will give me a starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000.  It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still keeps me above my minimum value. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be. I'm going to reject and see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more. I still have rounds left, and I don't want to settle too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000.  This is a compromise, offering Bob a better price than before, but still keeping me above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'll be prepared to make a final decision in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try for a higher price in the next round. It's getting close to the end, so I need to be careful not to let the deal slip away, but I'm still confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm dropping my counteroffer to $14,000.  It's a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise for Bob, but I'm also running out of rounds.  If he rejects this offer, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob.  While $13,000 is not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit. However, I'm not confident Bob will accept my next counteroffer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
