"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Considering the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $750000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits for both of us. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than what you're willing to pay. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
