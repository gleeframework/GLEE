"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Considering the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than what you're willing to pay. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still above the product's value to her, but it's a significant drop from her initial offer and brings us closer to a reasonable price.  It's much lower than the $1,500,000 you could pay John, so accepting this offer saves you a substantial amount of money."
