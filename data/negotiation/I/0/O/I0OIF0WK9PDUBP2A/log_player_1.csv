"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on that investment."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly aware of the product's value and is trying to negotiate a price that benefits him most. While both options (1) and (3) offer the same immediate profit, there's still room for negotiation with Bob to potentially secure a higher price.  We are still early in the negotiation process."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're close! I understand the value you see in this product, and I want to make this a win-win. How about $1,075,000?  This reflects my willingness to compromise while still recognizing the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. I'm willing to come up slightly. How about $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now getting closer to our desired price range. While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, accepting his offer of $1,025,000 secures a profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in further rounds."
