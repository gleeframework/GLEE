Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Highlighting a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knew you had a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, your negotiating position would be significantly weaker."
