Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $150, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially make a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but the ""limited time"" and ""special price"" framing might make it more tempting.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially leading to a price higher than $150. 

By starting high but not unreasonably so, you increase your chances of getting the best possible price for your product."
