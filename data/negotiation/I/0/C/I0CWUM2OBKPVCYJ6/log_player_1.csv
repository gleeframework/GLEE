Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation while still being above my minimum value.  It's important to remember that I can always fall back to John's offer of $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,000 is below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm going to try and get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It still keeps me above my minimum value, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $8,500 is a good price, as it's above my minimum value of $8,000. It's also close to the price that John is willing to pay, so I'm not losing out on much by accepting Bob's offer."
