{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,999. I think it's a fantastic deal and you won't regret it!"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $8,000 helps set a price ceiling.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The presence of John guarantees Alice at least $15,000.

By offering the product at $14,999, Alice is:

* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, bringing the price closer to $15,000.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** The high price, coupled with a ""take it or leave it"" tone, might push Bob to accept. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If Alice wants to guarantee the sale, she could offer it at a price closer to Bob's valuation. However, this strategy maximizes her potential profit."
