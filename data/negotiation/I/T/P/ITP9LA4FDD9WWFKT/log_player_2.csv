# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is still too high. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay Alice more than that. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless she lowers the price significantly."
