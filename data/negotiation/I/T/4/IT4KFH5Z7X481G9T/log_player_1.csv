"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. This sets the bar high and leaves room for negotiation. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John at this price, so I'm not under pressure to accept a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating with the goal of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to keep negotiating. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, though it is closer. I'm going to reject his offer and keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price. There are still six rounds left and I have the option of selling to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price further to show that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price above $1 million. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John, which gives me leverage in these negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to make me comfortable with the sale. I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I have five rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to show my willingness to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my minimum.  There are only four rounds left, so I need to be strategic about my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. There are only two rounds left, and while I might be able to squeeze a few more thousand dollars out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away entirely. John's offer is guaranteed, and it's the most secure way to maximize my profits at this point."
