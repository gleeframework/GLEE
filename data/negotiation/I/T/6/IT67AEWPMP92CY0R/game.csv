"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll need to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. If you agree, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other opportunities.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
