Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but not outrageously high. It allows room for negotiation without risking too much. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and see if it's reasonable. If it's too low, I'll make a counteroffer of my own.  I'll also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if I get stuck in a stalemate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not going to accept it just yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see where things go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit. I hope this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum and closer to my desired price than John's offer. It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation."
