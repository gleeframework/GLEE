"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $820,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $885,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you say?",885000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $860,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $875,000 as a final compromise. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let's finalize this transaction.",875000.0,Alice,5,
