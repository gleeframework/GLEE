Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still earning a decent profit for myself. I'll offer it to him for $10,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is lower than what I initially wanted, but it's still a decent offer. Since I can sell the product to John for $8,000, I'll consider that option as well.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll offer the product to Bob for $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 9500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was $9,000 and my initial offer was $10,000, I'll try to find a middle ground. I'll offer the product to Bob for $9,750.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob is sticking to his original offer of $9,000. Since I can still sell the product to John for $8,000, I'll consider that option.

However, I'll also try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'll reject his offer and send a new counteroffer. I'll offer the product to Bob for $9,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 9250}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob is already offering $9,000, I'll try to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'll offer the product to Bob for $9,200.

{""product_price"": 9200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob is now matching my previous counteroffer of $9,200. Since I can still sell the product to John for $8,000, I'll consider that option.

However, I'll also think about the potential profit I could make by selling to Bob. If I sell to Bob, I'll earn $9,200, which is a decent profit. But if I sell to John, I'll only earn $8,000, which is a smaller profit.

Considering the options, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $9,200.
