"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a significant profit margin while allowing me to get a good price. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would allow me to cover my costs and give you a very fair price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're really serious about this. $925,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go a little further. I'll accept your offer for $937,500. This gives us both a good deal, and hopefully, we can finalize this. What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the possibility of working with you.",920000.0,Bob,6,
