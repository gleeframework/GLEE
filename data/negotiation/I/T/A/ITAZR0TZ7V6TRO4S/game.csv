"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal, as you know the value of this product is very high. Let's start the negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'm thinking of offering $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,400,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,450,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to come closer to my desired price.  I believe this is a deal we can both agree on.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting closer to a deal, Alice, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking of offering $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
