"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $800,000. A counteroffer of $850,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. While it's still lower than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer again, potentially getting closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $800,000.  Increasing the offer slightly from the previous round shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good deal. This also keeps the negotiations moving forward instead of risking a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price and is getting closer to John's offer of $1,000,000. At this point, the negotiation is not yielding a significantly better price than what John is offering. It's in Bob's best interest to cut his losses and buy the product from John, ensuring a predictable and final price. Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of an extended process without a guarantee of a better price."
