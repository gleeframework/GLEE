Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,999. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($12,000).
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so we don't need to go below that price.
* **Psychology:**  Offering $11,999 instead of a flat $12,000 might make Bob feel like he's getting a slightly better deal, increasing the chance of acceptance."
