"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I believe the product is worth more. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,400,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the value of the product. This should hopefully encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $1,350,000.  This is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is close to my target. While I could try to push for a higher price, I'm concerned about the risk of further negotiations breaking down. I'm comfortable with this price and want to ensure the sale is finalized."
