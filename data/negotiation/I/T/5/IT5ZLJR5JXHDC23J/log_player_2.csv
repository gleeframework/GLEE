"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further. There's a chance she might be willing to come closer to her own valuation of $800,000 to make a sale."
