"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth a lot to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget without immediately going for the full amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am only willing to pay up to $1200000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer just yet. It's too early in the negotiation, and I want to see if I can secure a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,200,000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,400,000 to make this deal happen. Let's find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1300000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,300,000, which is closer to my desired price.  It's a good offer and with only 6 rounds left, I'm willing to accept it to avoid risking a lower offer later or having to sell to John."
