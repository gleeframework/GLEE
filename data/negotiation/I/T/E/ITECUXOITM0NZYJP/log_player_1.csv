Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible. I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer is significantly higher, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, hoping to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and move us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a price below my minimum.  John offers me my desired price, so I'll take his offer and sell to him."
