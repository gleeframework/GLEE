"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  How about $12,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. If you're serious about selling, let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 just isn't quite enough for me. How about $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. Let's make it happen!",12000.0,Alice,5,
