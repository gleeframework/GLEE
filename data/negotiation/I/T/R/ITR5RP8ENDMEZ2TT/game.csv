"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while I get a fair price. Let's make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it and the fact that I'm ready to make a deal today.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This is a good compromise, and it still allows you to acquire this valuable product at a competitive price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
