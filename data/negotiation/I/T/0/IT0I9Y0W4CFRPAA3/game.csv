"Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to acquire [product name] for a competitive price of $1,650,000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the value it brings to your [Bob's business/use case]. Let me know your thoughts!",1650000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,650,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,300,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000 to facilitate this deal.  This price still reflects the value of [product name], and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to this.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and while $1,375,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there yet. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer [product name] for $1,425,000. This final offer considers both our interests and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know your thoughts.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
