"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,100,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a lower price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident in the value of this product, but my budget is limited.  Let's split the difference and go with $987,500. This feels like a fair price that reflects both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer ($950,000) and Alice's offer ($1,025,000), showing your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Demonstrates your commitment:** By offering a specific price, you show that you're serious about closing the deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your offer, I'm targeting a slightly higher number. Would you consider $1,000,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,000,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go up to $990,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value I place on this product while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 990000}
