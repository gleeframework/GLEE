"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident in the value of this product, but my budget is limited.  Let's split the difference and go with $987,500. This feels like a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",987500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your offer, I'm targeting a slightly higher number. Would you consider $1,000,000?  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,000,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go up to $990,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value I place on this product while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
