"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's tailored to meet your specific needs and is valued at $12,000 by you. To start, I propose a price of $11,000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is close to your maximum price. However, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to create a larger gap to encourage negotiation.
* **Reasonable Price:**  $9,500 is still above Alice's value of $8,000, leaving room for a deal that benefits both parties.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, suggesting a willingness to discuss further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My proposed price for the product is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to your desired price point. Accepting this offer would save you $2,000 compared to buying from John. There's a good chance you could get an even lower price through further negotiation, but the risk of losing the deal to John is not worth it at this point."
