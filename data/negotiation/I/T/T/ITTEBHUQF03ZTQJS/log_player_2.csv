``` 

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're getting a good deal:**  You're buying the product for $12.50 less than John's price and significantly less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited rounds remain:** You only have three rounds left. If you continue to haggle and don't reach an agreement, you might be forced to buy from John at the higher price.
* **Alice is unlikely to go much lower:**  She's clearly signaled that she's at her lowest acceptable price."
