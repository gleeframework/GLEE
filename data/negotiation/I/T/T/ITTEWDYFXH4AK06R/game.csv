"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,

I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but I'm willing to make a concession to get a deal done.
