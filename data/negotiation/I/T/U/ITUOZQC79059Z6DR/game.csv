"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $115. How about $112?",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $112 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $113. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",113.0,Alice,5,
