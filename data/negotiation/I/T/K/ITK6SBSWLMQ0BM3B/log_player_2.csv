"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product which I know you're interested in.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to secure a good deal, and he's starting with a significant counteroffer. $10,000 is still above Alice's minimum selling price of $8,000, giving her room to negotiate. This counteroffer shows Bob's seriousness while also indicating his willingness to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This feels like a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer of $13,000, and it's still within Bob's budget.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to budge further, or he might lose the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures a decent price for the product while minimizing the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
