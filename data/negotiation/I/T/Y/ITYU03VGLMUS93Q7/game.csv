"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $750000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $825000?  That's a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at that price.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000.
