"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than buying from John for $15,000 and still within Bob's budget. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, so accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
