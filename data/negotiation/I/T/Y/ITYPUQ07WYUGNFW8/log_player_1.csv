{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident Bob will find this offer attractive, but I'm also prepared to counter if he makes a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $13000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
