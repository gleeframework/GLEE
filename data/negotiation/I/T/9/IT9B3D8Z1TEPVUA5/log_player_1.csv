Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still securing a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000).
* **Secure a Deal:**  This price is high enough to be very profitable for me but fair enough that Bob is likely to accept, avoiding the risk of him rejecting the offer and forcing me to sell to John at a lower price."
