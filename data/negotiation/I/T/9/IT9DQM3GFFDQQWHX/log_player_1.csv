Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances getting a good price while leaving room for negotiation. Here's why:

* **Above minimum:** $14,000 is above my minimum of $10,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Below Bob's value:** It's still below what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **Opening the door:** This offer sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth, maximizing my chances of getting a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is still above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and go to $12750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer a higher price, $12,750 is still a decent profit for me and a good compromise.  The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and continuing to reject and counteroffer risks losing Bob entirely.  It's better to secure a sale at a price I'm comfortable with than risk getting stuck with the lower price from John."
