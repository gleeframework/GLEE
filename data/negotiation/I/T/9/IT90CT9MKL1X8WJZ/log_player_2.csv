# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the best possible deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm counteroffering at $875,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $850,000. It's highly unlikely she'll agree to a price closer to $800,000 within the remaining rounds.  Since you have the option to buy from John at $800,000, it's no longer strategically beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice."
