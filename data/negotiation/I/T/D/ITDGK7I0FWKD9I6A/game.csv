"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its value and uniqueness.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget, I'm prepared to offer $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a reasonable price considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still outside my budget.  To move forward, I'd need to see the price come down further. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable number. I'm prepared to offer $800000, which is the maximum I can spend. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $800000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far.",825000.0,Alice,5,
