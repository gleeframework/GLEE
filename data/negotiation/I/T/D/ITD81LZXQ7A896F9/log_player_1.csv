Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my understanding of the market value, I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the product's potential and my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the market and my own valuation. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.
