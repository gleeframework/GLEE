Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm looking to get the best price possible, $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable threshold. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $775,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal if we continue negotiating. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's keep moving towards a win-win.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and a good opportunity for you to get a valuable product. Let's finalize the deal!"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I could accept it. However, John is offering the same price, and there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob.  I'll sell to John and avoid any further risk of a deal falling through."
