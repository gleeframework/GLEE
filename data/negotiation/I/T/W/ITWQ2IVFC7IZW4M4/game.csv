"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1250000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which still allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1350000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
