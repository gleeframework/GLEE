"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it is a good deal considering its value to Alice, it's still not a good deal for you.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1250000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which still allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.
