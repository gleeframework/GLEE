{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $1,000,000 is a bold move, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to push for a lower price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to his target, but he wants to see if he can push for a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer, but still trying to get a better price. $1,025,000 is a reasonable compromise, offering a significant savings compared to the initial price and leaving room for Alice to also get a decent deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has been negotiating for a while, and Alice is firming up her stance. $1,030,000 is a good price, especially considering John's offer of $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant savings and secures the product."
