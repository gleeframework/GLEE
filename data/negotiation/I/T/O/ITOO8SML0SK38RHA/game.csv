"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. You get a valuable product at a good price, and I get a quick sale. Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm really trying to stay closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I hope you'll consider it. If you're serious about acquiring the product, I believe this price is fair and reflects its value.  Let me know your thoughts.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, how about $800,000 even? That's the absolute best I can do.",800000.0,Bob,6,
