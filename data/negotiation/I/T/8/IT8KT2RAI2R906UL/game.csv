"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $140? ",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I understand you're looking to save some cash, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price point.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $155? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",155.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! I understand you're trying to squeeze every last penny out of this deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $165. This is the lowest I can go and still make a decent profit. If you're willing to meet me at $165, I'm happy to finalize the deal.",165.0,Alice,5,
