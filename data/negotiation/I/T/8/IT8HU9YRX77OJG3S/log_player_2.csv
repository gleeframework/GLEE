"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, accepting Alice's offer for $11,500 is the best option. It's still below your maximum budget of $15,000 and a better deal than buying from John.  There's a good chance you could continue negotiating, but there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. It's better to take the deal while it's still a good one."
