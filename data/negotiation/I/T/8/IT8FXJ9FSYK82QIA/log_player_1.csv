Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. It's priced at $1,500,000, reflecting its exceptional qualities and potential. I'm confident this is a fair offer, but I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,500,000 gives me room to negotiate and still achieve my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Framing Value:** Highlighting the product's ""uniqueness"" and ""potential"" implies it could be worth even more to Bob, making the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** Showing willingness to discuss the price indicates flexibility and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Plan B:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget allows for a maximum investment of $800000. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we aim for $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum desired price. 
* **No Significant Upside:**  Negotiating further risks losing Bob and getting a lower offer from John. 
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting now avoids further rounds of negotiation and secures the desired price."
