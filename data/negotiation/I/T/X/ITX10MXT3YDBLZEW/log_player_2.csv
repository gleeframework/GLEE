The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice's offer is $110, which is above your budget. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!

While $95 is closer to your budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay. You can try to negotiate a lower price again."
