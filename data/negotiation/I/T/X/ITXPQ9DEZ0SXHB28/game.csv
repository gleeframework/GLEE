"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'll give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I'll offer it to you for $11,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I'm willing to go up slightly to $10,250. Let's make a deal!",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I've already given you a lot of ground, and I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll meet you halfway between $10,250 and my original offer of $11,500. I'll offer it to you for $10,875. This is my final offer. What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,7,
