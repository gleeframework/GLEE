Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something that could greatly benefit you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price without revealing my bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob, avoiding the need to settle for the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
