"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth $1,200,000 to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects its true worth and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects its true value to me. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to me and leaves you with a significant profit. Let me know if you're open to this final offer.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,025,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'll make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000, which is still a good deal considering its value to me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
