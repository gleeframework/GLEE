Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $10,875?  That's a fair compromise and a price that still gives you a good value. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and this price is close enough to my goal. It's better to accept a good deal now than risk the negotiations stalling out and having to go with John."
