"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
