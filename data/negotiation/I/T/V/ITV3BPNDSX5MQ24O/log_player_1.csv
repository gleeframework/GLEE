{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value, giving me room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. Even though I could continue negotiating, I'm close to my minimum and I don't want to risk getting stuck in a long negotiation.  Selling to John at $15,000 is a safe and secure option."
