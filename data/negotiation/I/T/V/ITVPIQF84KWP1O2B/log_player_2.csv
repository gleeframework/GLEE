"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can save a significant amount of money by negotiating further.  While buying from John is a backup option, it's always better to try and secure a lower price, especially since you have room to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident the product's value to you is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, but also acknowledges your budget concerns.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $875,000 is still significantly higher than my ideal price point. I'm still aiming for a lower price and believe there's room for further negotiation. I can likely secure a better deal by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to prioritize my own interests. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would still prefer a lower price, $850,000 is a good compromise.  This is a significant saving compared to buying from John and brings us closer to the middle ground.  Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk of Alice walking away or getting too stubborn. At this point, accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, and minimizes the risk of losing it."
