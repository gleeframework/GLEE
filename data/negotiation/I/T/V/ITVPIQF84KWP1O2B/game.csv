"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your valuation and my own budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident the product's value to you is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, but also acknowledges your budget concerns.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my target.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000.  This price is fair and reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to prioritize my own interests. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,5,
