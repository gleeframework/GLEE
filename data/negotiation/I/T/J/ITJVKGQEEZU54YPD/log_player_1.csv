""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and while I have other interested parties, I believe you would benefit from it immensely. I'm willing to make a special offer just for you at $1,300,000.  This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $800,000 to Bob provides a starting point for negotiation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a significant profit margin for Alice while still potentially being attractive to Bob (saving him $500,000 compared to his own valuation).
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents prolonged negotiations that might lead to missing out on the guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. How Bob responds to this offer might necessitate adjustments in subsequent communication."
