Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been unwavering in his maximum offer of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. Accepting his offer would mean missing out on potential profit, while continuing the negotiation risks losing John's guaranteed offer. It's in Alice's best interest to cut her losses and secure the $1,000,000 from John, rather than risk getting stuck with no deal at all."
