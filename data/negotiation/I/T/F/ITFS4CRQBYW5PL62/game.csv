"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $125? I'm really hoping to get a good deal, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal!",130.0,Bob,4,
