**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above my maximum budget of $120. I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

While Alice has come down in price, $135 is still above my maximum budget of $120. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  I believe there's still room for both of us to compromise."
