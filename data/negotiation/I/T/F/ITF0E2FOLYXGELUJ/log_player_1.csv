Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards, if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Consider John as a Back-up:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so I shouldn't go below that price. 

By starting at $925,000, I give myself a good chance to secure a significant profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
