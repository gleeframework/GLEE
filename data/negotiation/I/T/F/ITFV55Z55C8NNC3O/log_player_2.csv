"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering what you could gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice is motivated to sell:**  She values the product at $1,000,000 and is starting negotiations higher.
* **You have a fallback:** John offers a ceiling price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might lead her to lower the price further."
