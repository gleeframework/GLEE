Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,700,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can't go higher than $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves you with a good profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can push for a better price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get $1,200,000 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and allows for a profit for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to receive at least $1,100,000 for this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit much for me. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and allows for a profit for you.  If we can't find agreement here, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and meet me halfway.
