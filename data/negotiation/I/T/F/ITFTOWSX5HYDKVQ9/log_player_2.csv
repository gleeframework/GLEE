"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,700,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can't go higher than $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves you with a good profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get $1,200,000 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and allows for a profit for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to receive at least $1,100,000 for this product. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on it and my need to cover my costs. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit much for me. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,000,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and meet me halfway. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  Even though you're getting closer, it's becoming clear that you won't be able to negotiate down to a price you're comfortable with. Buying from John is the best option at this point, as you can secure the product for a price within your budget."
