"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is my final offer, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford. If you're not able to accept it, I'll have to go with John's offer.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 simply doesn't cover my costs.  To make this work, I'd need to come down to $9,000. This is a final offer from my end, as I'm confident the product is worth that much to you.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll have to go with John's offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
