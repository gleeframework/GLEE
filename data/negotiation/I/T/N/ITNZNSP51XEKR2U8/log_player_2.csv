"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $10,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,250 is closer to his budget than Alice's initial offer, he can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further. He is still within his budget if he needs to buy from John, so there is no immediate risk in rejecting."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is my final offer, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford. If you're not able to accept it, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 simply doesn't cover my costs.  To make this work, I'd need to come down to $9,000. This is a final offer from my end, as I'm confident the product is worth that much to you.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has reached his limit. He's already offered his maximum price and Alice has countered with a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay. While it's tempting to negotiate further, Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at a lower price.  He is better off buying from John and securing the product for his desired price."
