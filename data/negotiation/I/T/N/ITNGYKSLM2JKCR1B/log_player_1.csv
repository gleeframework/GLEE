This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also encourages Bob to engage by expressing confidence in the deal's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $130 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $135?  That seems like a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $132. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While $132 is still below my desired price, it's a good compromise.  I want to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to Bob rejecting my next offer or me losing the sale to John."
