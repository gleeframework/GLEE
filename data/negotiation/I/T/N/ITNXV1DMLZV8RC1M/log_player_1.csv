{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob some wiggle room to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **John as a Backup:** The threat of selling to John for $1,500,000 gives me a strong bargaining position.  

This offer allows me to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob.  If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly and continue negotiating. However, if he doesn't come close to my desired price, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think it's a bit pricey, but I really like the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still $200,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiating Room:** I still have room to negotiate with Bob. He clearly values the product, and I can try to get closer to my desired price.
* **The Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, it might be too early to do so. I might be able to squeeze out a better price from Bob through further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll likely offer a price slightly lower than my original offer but higher than Bob's offer. This strategy keeps the negotiation going while still pushing Bob closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,350,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident this is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Keeping the Pressure On:**  While I'm lowering the price, I'm not dropping it significantly.  This shows I'm still firm about the product's value.
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, which strengthens my position in the negotiation.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while keeping me closer to my desired price.  If Bob rejects, I can still lower the price a bit more. But I'm hoping he sees the value in this offer and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still $20,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,300,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We've gone through a few rounds already, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much. 
* **Risk of Lower Offers:**  If I keep rejecting Bob, he might get frustrated and offer an even lower price. 
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:**  I can always sell to John for my desired price, but I want to see if I can get closer to that with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap. This time, I'll offer a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'll try to emphasize the value of the product to him and remind him of the possibility of selling to another buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but this product is truly worth more than your offer. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is my absolute bottom line, considering the value this product offers you.  It's a fair deal, and it allows me to avoid selling to another buyer who's eager to pay my asking price. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting this as my final offer to Bob, showing that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing a willingness to be flexible.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product brings, making him think twice about walking away.
* **Threat of Other Buyer:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have an alternative buyer, creating pressure to finalize the deal.

This offer is designed to be enticing to Bob while still securing a price that meets my minimum acceptable requirement. If he rejects this offer, I'll be ready to sell to John, as further negotiations might not be fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,300,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we've reached an impasse. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could waste valuable time, and there's no guarantee we'll reach an agreement. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is a significant profit and meets my minimum requirements.

**Conclusion:**

At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John and secure the guaranteed profit.  While I'd prefer to make a slightly higher profit, I'm not willing to risk losing a sale and going through further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiation with Bob."
