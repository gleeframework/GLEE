Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and Alice can still make a profit even if she comes down slightly. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price.

By setting the price at $9,500, Alice aims to strike a balance between maximizing her potential profit and securing the sale with Bob."
