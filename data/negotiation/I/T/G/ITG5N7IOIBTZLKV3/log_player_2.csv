"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is less than your $120 maximum, there's a good chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might encourage her to offer a lower price, or you can always fall back on buying from John."
