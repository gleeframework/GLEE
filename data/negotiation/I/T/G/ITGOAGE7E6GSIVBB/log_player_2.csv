"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer. You can always fall back on buying from John for $150 if needed."
