Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

This offer starts with a price that is a good starting point for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's estimated value but leaves room for a deal within 10 rounds. I'm also being polite and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While $1,250,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not willing to settle for anything less than $1,350,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can convince him to come up a bit more in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your commitment to this deal.  $1,325,000 is close, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,340,000? This would allow us to both walk away satisfied with the agreement."", ""product_price"": 1340000}
