"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I can't go lower than $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for you to make a profit.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I truly appreciate your commitment to this deal.  $1,325,000 is close, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,340,000? This would allow us to both walk away satisfied with the agreement.",1340000.0,Alice,7,
