Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Starting too low (much closer to $12,000) might make Bob think the product is less valuable and reduce the chance of reaching his higher valuation.

This strategy balances getting the best possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale altogether."
