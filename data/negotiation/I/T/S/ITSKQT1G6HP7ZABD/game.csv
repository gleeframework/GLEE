"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  This feels fair to both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $122.50 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is my absolute limit.  Let's make this happen!",120.0,Bob,4,
