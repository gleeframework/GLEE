"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer.  Alice might be willing to go lower, and it's worth exploring that possibility before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount, aiming for a 20% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not accepting her first offer.  It will give Alice an opportunity to counter, allowing us to potentially find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer. While I'd prefer to get it for $120, $135 is a good price within my budget, and it's risky to keep pushing, potentially risking losing the deal altogether.  It's a good compromise."
