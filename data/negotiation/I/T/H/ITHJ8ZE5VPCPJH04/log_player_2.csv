Alice's offer is way too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $165?  That's a significant price drop from my initial offer and reflects the value this product brings.

While $165 is closer to my desired price, it's still too high. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate further."
