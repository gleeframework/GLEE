"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it, considering the value it provides to me. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $165?  That's a significant price drop from my initial offer and reflects the value this product brings.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $165 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
