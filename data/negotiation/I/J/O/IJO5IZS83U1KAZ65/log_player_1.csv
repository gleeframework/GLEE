Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my needs? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I'm sorry to say that $130 is still slightly above my budget. I'd like to propose one last time at $125. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle.

You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than his $125 offer. Taking the guaranteed $150 from John is the best move to maximize profit."
