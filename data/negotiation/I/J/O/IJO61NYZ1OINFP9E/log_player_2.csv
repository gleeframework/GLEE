{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price.  Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. I'm aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise. A counteroffer of $700,000 is a strong starting point."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's new offer of $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than my initial counteroffer. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to accept her last offer. I'm hoping this will incentivize her to meet me halfway in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could continue to negotiate, the potential gains are shrinking. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking further negotiation rounds that might not lead to a better deal.  It's also important to consider that if I continue rejecting Alice's offers, she might get frustrated and decide to stop negotiating altogether, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price."
