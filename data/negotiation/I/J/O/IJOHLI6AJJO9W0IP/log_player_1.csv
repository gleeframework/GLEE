Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 
 
My reasoning:

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher than the asking price, potentially making Bob more receptive.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still ensuring I don't lose out on a sale."
