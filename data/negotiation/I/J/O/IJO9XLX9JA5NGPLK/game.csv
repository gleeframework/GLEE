"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it at a price of $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring you.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a better price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 significantly undervalues the product and the benefits it offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still providing you a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,000. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is my final offer, as it's a significant discount already.  I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain from the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $9,000? I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,6,
