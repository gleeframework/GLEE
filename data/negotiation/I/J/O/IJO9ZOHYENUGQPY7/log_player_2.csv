"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500.

Alice's first offer is too high. I know I can get a better price, either from Alice or from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,750.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is barely budging on price.  I'll send a counteroffer closer to my target, but I need to be prepared to walk away soon if she doesn't come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that price is still too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,800.  Let me know what you think."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'll offer the product to you for $9,500, which is closer to your previous offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is stalling! She's back to her original offer.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better price or I'll walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to walking away.  I need to see a price that works for me, or I'll have to buy from someone else. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to walking away, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $9,250, which is a bit above your final offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is not budging enough. It's time to walk away. She's not respecting my ""final offer"" and is unlikely to come down much further. John's offer of $12,000 is starting to look better than wasting more time with Alice."
