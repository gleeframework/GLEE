"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have to make it worthwhile, and I'm keen to find an agreement. How about we meet halfway at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,125. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $10,000? That's a fair offer, and it allows us to close the deal today.",10000.0,Bob,6,
