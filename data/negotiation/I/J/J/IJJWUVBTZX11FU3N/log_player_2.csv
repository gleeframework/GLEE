Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm unable to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.
