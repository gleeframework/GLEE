"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I need to get closer to $105 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference -  what do you think about $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, which would be $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can't go as low as $95, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about $98? This is a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $98 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",92.0,Bob,6,
