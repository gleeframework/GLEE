"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, giving Bob some room to negotiate but still ensuring I'm getting a good deal. I'm also being friendly and positive, hoping to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'm not willing to sell for my minimum right away.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This gives you a good price, while still ensuring I get a fair value for my product.  Let's make this deal happen! "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground with this counteroffer. I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.  I'm also trying to keep the tone positive and encouraging to hopefully reach an agreement quickly."
