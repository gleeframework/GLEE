Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently lowballing and doesn't seem to value the product at a price I'm willing to accept.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a real risk he won't budge much higher than $8,200. Accepting John's offer of $8,000 guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price. It's better to take the sure thing than risk getting less later."
