"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with another seller.",9500.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to sell at $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,,
