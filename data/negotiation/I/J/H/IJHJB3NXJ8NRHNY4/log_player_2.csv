"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite high, considering her product's worth to her is significantly lower. There's room for negotiation here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I believe the product could be valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's slightly below Alice's valuation. This gives us some bargaining space, and it lets Alice know I'm serious about purchasing but need a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value significantly exceeds your current offer. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we're still quite far apart. It seems like there's more room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need a price that makes sense for me too. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm proposing a price that matches Alice's valuation. This could be a good compromise point, as she's unlikely to go much lower, and it allows me to potentially secure the product with a significant saving compared to John's offer."
