Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The $1,400,000 offer is closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than your minimum ($1,200,000). This increases the likelihood of him engaging in further negotiation.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** Remember, you have a guaranteed offer from John. This gives you leverage and the confidence to aim high with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I believe the product could be valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,500,000). This suggests there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer allows you to steer the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value significantly exceeds your current offer. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your initial offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). This signals flexibility while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's high value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth beyond his initial offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While this counteroffer is still above your safety net of John's offer, it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and keeps the door open for Bob to make a more reasonable counter-proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need a price that makes sense for me too. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. While you might be able to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains are minimal. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable deal without risking further negotiation and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
