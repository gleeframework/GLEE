"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to buy it for $1,000,000. It's a fair offer, and I'm sure we can make a deal work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $1,150,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,150,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $1,112,500. This would allow us to both make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",1112500.0,Alice,5,
