Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point.** It's above Bob's valuation of $12,000, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.**  It sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a sale!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll wait for his counteroffer and then decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer based on his offer and my remaining time before selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While it's closer, it's not enough for me to accept yet. 
* **I have the option of selling to John for a higher price.**  This makes it less risky for me to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

**Next steps:**

* **I will make a counteroffer to Bob.** I'll try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $13,500?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm trying to meet Bob halfway.**  By offering $13,500, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming to get a price closer to my minimum.
* **I'm emphasizing the compromise.**  This makes it sound like a fair and mutually beneficial deal. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a sale at a price I'm comfortable with.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John.  The outcome will depend on Bob's counteroffer and how much time is left before I lose the opportunity to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,500. How about $13,250? That would be a good compromise for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.** While $13,250 is still below my ideal of $15,000, it's only $750 away.
* **There's a risk of losing the sale to John.** If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I might end up with no sale at all.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing everything.

**Next steps:**

* **I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $13,250.**  This is a good compromise that allows me to make a decent profit while also securing a sale."
