Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob is worth a shot. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **Bob:**  Gets a $400,000 discount from the original price, a significant saving.
    * **Alice:**  Still makes a significant profit of $400,000 above Bob's perceived value.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially influencing Bob to act quickly."
