"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $6,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and what it can do for you.  To move this forward, I could consider $12,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Would you consider $7,000?  I feel that's a reasonable price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
