"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,250,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This price still offers a significant benefit to you and allows me to get closer to my desired value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,275,000 is an improvement, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference: $1,312,500. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,312,500

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This price gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's the closest I can come to meet your offer.  Let's finish this negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and the price of $1,300,000 is a good deal compared to your alternative (John at $1,500,000).  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and there's always the risk Alice could become less flexible."
