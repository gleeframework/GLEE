Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but lower than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price. I'm confident that I can still earn a decent amount, even if I have to drop my price a bit.  If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push him a bit higher.  I'm also considering John's offer, but I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum just yet. I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,600,000, which is still below my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want a decent price. Hopefully, this will entice Bob to come up a bit more. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I ideally want.  At this point, I'm starting to feel like I'm hitting a ceiling with Bob.  It's becoming clear that I'm unlikely to get a much higher price from him, and I don't want to risk losing more time on negotiations.  John's offer is my minimum, and it's a guaranteed sale, so I'm going to take it."
