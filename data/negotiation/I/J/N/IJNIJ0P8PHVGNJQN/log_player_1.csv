Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,800,000. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer in John, my goal is to maximize my profit. Bob valuing the product at $1,000,000 means there's potential for him to pay a significant premium.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,800,000 sets a strong anchor point. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than John's $1,000,000 offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. If Bob rejects the offer outright, I lose the opportunity to make a higher profit. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price from Bob makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
