Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $130. It's a great deal for a product that's worth at least that much to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $130 is higher than your minimum of $120, giving you some profit.
* **It's within the range of what Bob values:**  Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is friendly and straightforward, focusing on the value proposition. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product is worth $120 to you, so I would like to propose a price of $115 for the product. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I want to try to get closer to my desired price.  John is a backup option, but I'm willing to negotiate with Bob a bit more to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $115 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50?  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  This is a common negotiation tactic that shows compromise and fairness. It offers a middle ground that might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer.
* **Maintain a clear goal:**  I'm still aiming for a price higher than $120, so $117.50 is a step in the right direction.
* **Friendly tone:**  Keeping the communication positive helps maintain a good rapport during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I would like to propose a price of $116 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $116
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $116 is closer to my desired price than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum. I've gone through several rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to reach a price that's acceptable to me.  Rather than continuing to haggle, I'd rather sell the product to John for $120.  This ensures I get at least my minimum desired price, and I can move on to other opportunities."
