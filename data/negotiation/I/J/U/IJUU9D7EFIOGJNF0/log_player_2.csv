It's not worth paying more than your maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down significantly.  This is a big jump from her initial offer, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for negotiation."
