Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, given my minimum value of $1,500,000 and the fact that I can always fall back to John's offer if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum value. I believe this price is fair and leaves room for further negotiation if Bob wants to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below it. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum value and avoids any further hassle."
