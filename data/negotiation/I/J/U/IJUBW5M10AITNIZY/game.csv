"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Can we meet in the middle at $1800000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'd like to hear from you.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a final price. While I appreciate your offer, $1700000 is simply too low for me.  I'm not willing to go below $1800000, and I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. ",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go below $1800000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose $1750000. This is a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1750000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  I'll propose $1775000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your decision.",1775000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1775000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1725000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1725000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $1725000 is simply not acceptable.  We've been negotiating for a while now, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll offer $1750000. This is my absolute final offer, and it reflects the value of the product while recognizing your needs.  If you're serious about purchasing, I urge you to consider this offer.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1750000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be honest with you, I've been considering buying the product from John for $1500000. I'm willing to go up to $1675000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1675000.0,Bob,10,
