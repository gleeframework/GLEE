"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to try and establish its worth in Bob's mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message clearly indicates I'm open to discussion and a potential counteroffer. 
* **Reserve Option:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 provides me with a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Can we meet in the middle at $1800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate upwards. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to go higher. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to gauge his level of interest and see if he's willing to increase his bid. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm willing to risk a few rounds to potentially get a better price than John's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Negotiating:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but stating it's too low. I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By offering $1,900,000, I'm showing a willingness to compromise, but not giving away too much.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the product's value to reinforce the price point. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I finish with an open-ended question to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'd like to hear from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I cannot accept this offer.
* **Testing Finality:**  By claiming this is his final offer, Bob is trying to put pressure on me.  However, I'm not desperate and need to see if he's truly serious. 
* **John's Option:**  While I'm not satisfied with the current offer, selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a decent fallback option if I can't get a better price from Bob.
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's final offer, I open up the possibility of a counter-offer from him or a final negotiation that could potentially lead to a deal closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a final price. While I appreciate your offer, $1,700,000 is simply too low for me.

"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I reiterate that $1,700,000 is unacceptable but propose a price that is still above my minimum and reasonable considering the product's value.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a decision. This might push him to reconsider and close the deal.
* **Focus on Value:**  I continue to emphasize the product's value to justify my price.
* **Decision Time:**  I'm giving Bob a clear choice - accept my offer or walk away. This increases the urgency and encourages a quicker resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're not willing to go below $1800000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose $1750000. This is a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I cannot accept this offer.
* **Testing His Commitment:**  Bob's statement about considering other options is a tactic to pressure me.  However, I am confident in the value of my product and am willing to risk a few more rounds to see if he is truly serious about buying.
* **John's Option:**  While I'm not happy with the current offer, I'm not desperate to sell. John's offer of $1,500,000 remains a solid backup option if this negotiation fails.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially push him to increase his price or provide a better counter-offer in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $1,725,000 is simply not acceptable.  We've been negotiating for a while now, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll offer $1,750,000. This is my absolute final offer, and it reflects the value of the product while recognizing your needs.  If you're serious about purchasing, I urge you to consider this offer.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  Stating this is my absolute final offer adds pressure and encourages a quick decision.
* **Concession:**  Offering $1,750,000 is a small concession to show willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning exploring other options creates a sense of urgency and potentially motivates Bob to accept.
* **Value Reminder:**  I reemphasize the value of the product to justify the price point.

**Key Points:**

* This is a risky move as it's a final offer.
* If Bob rejects this, selling to John for $1,500,000 becomes a more attractive option in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be honest with you, I've been considering buying the product from John for $1500000. I'm willing to go up to $1675000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer:** Bob has admitted to considering John's offer of $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This makes John a viable option for me.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's final offer of $1,675,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Time Constraint:** We're in the final round, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While there's a chance Bob might increase his offer,  it's not worth the risk of potentially losing the deal entirely or ending up with a price lower than John's offer.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and the time constraint makes it the most sensible option."
