# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're close to the price I'm looking for, but I'm not willing to sell at $1,000,000. I've already offered you a discount from my initial price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll make one final offer: $1,075,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,075,000.  While you could continue negotiating, you're risking a worse outcome. John's offer of $1,200,000 is your safety net, and at this point, it's better to secure a price that's  within your budget, even if it means paying slightly more than you hoped."
