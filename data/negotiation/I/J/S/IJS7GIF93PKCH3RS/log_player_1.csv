Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys from you at a good price.
* **Your Leverage:** You have John as a backup, which gives you negotiating power. Bob doesn't know this directly, but it's implied in you confidently setting a price.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob with a potential profit that's attractive enough for him to accept. 

Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  You're highlighting the product's value and your belief in it.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  This subtly suggests there might be other interested parties, even if there aren't.
* **Price Point:** $1,150,000 lets Bob make a $50,000 profit, which is a good incentive. You're capturing the lion's share of the value while ensuring Bob is likely to accept.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can decide if you're willing to go lower than $1,150,000, keeping your $1,000,000 safety net in mind. 
* **Relationship:** Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If it's important, you might leave a little more profit on the table to foster goodwill."
