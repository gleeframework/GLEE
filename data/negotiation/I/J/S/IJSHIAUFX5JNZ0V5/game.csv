"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a good compromise for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
