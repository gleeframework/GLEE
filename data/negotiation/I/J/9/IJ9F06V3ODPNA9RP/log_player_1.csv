"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $11,000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $9,000 doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  It's becoming clear that we are not going to agree on a price. While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds, and John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum value.  It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
