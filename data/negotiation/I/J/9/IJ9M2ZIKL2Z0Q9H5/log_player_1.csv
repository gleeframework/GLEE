Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point while also ensuring that I'm not immediately rejecting his potential value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer at this time. "", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining a price that's closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to go down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to further compromise, and selling to John guarantees me my minimum price."
