"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering its value to me is $15000.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to reach an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $12250. This is the best I can do, considering the value I place on the product.",12250.0,Alice,5,
