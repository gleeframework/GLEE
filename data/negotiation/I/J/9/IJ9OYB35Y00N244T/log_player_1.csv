Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, which might encourage him to accept.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** My message doesn't close the door on negotiation, which keeps the conversation going. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully made a profit!
* If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and either accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. 
* I'll keep in mind John's offer of $15,000 as a backup if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I could accept his offer, it would leave me with a smaller profit than I'd like.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe I can still get a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **John as Backup:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if Bob doesn't meet my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is a bit below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in too much.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to both of us, which might appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Urgency:** The ""Let's see if we can make this work!"" adds a slight sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I'll be able to sell the product for a decent profit.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or go with John's offer.  
* **John as Backup:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within $12,000. Could we possibly meet at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Insistence:** Bob is firm on his $12,000 price, and I've already made a concession. 
* **My Minimum:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer:**  John is guaranteed to buy the product for my minimum price. This is the best option for me to ensure I meet my profit goal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:** I'll contact John and finalize the sale."
