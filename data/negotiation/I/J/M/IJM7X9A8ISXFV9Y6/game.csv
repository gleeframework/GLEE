"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1950000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so my new counteroffer is $1825000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1925000. This is a fair price, considering the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see some movement from your side.",1925000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $1875000. This is my final offer, and I expect it to be a fair price for both of us.",1875000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've made several concessions, and I'm not sure how much more I'm willing to give. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a deal. I'm counteroffering at $1800000, which is right in the middle of our previous discussions. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1800000.0,Alice,9,
