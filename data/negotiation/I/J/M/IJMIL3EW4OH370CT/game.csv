"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to invest a bit less. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value lies above $700,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth.",850000.0,Alice,3,
