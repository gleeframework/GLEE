Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the $1,000,000 range. This product is worth a lot to me, but I need to make sure it's a good deal. Let's work together to find a price that makes sense for both of us.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
