# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, I'm going to have to counter with a lower price of $600000. This is still a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the fair market value of what you're offering. Let me know if you're willing to discuss this further.
