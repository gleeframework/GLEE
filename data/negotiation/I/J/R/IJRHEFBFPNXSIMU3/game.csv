"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, I'm going to have to counter with a lower price of $600000. This is still a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the fair market value of what you're offering. Let me know if you're willing to discuss this further.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $750000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I'm offering. Let me know if you're willing to consider this new price.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $700000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering what you'll be getting. Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.",725000.0,Alice,5,
