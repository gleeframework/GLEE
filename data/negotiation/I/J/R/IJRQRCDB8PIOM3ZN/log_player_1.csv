Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if listed publicly, justifying the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer doesn't completely shut down the possibility of negotiation if Bob counters. 

This strategy aims to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while acknowledging that you have a fallback option with John."
