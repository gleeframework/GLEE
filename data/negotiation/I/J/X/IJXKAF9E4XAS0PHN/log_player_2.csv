"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about we settle on $10,600? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer it to you for $10,700. It's a small step closer to your budget, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $700 above Bob's ideal price of $10,000. At this point, further negotiation might take too much time and may not lead to a significant price reduction.  It's more beneficial for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product, especially considering the time constraint of 10 rounds."
