"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To be realistic, I can't go lower than $1,400,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value you'll gain from it.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is still too high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
