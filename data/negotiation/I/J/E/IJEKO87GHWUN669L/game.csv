"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about $95?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Would you be willing to compromise and sell it to me at that price?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $92.50 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $94? It's a small difference, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the extra few dollars. Let me know what you think!",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm not willing to go up to $94. I'm still thinking of the $92.50 I offered earlier. I'm willing to add a small premium for the product's value, but $94 is too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $93?",93.0,Bob,6,
