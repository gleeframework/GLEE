"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. This is a truly unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1500000 is my minimum, I believe this product has the potential to be worth much more to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000 as a starting point. This reflects the value I know you'll realize from it. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1750000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, but that's my absolute maximum. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to consider a price closer to the middle ground â€“ $1600000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes both our needs. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is a good price. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that buying from John for $1000000 might be a better option.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
