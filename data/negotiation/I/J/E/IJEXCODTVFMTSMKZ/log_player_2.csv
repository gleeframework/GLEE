"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is higher than my goal. I will try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see how much room for negotiation there is. It's closer to Alice's value, but still within a range that would save me money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we say $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room to negotiate a bit lower. I'll reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $105? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer but still gives Alice some profit. This keeps the negotiation moving while pushing for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the way you think, Bob! $105 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle of $105 and $110? That would be $107.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a fair price and is getting close to my ideal range. While I could try to haggle further,  $107.50 is a good deal and saves me a decent amount compared to John's offer. It's time to accept."
