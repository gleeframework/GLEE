"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, let me know!",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you being flexible, Alice. However, $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my final offer. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, Bob. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",10000.0,Alice,7,
