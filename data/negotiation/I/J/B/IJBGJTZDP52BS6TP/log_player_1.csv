Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a profit significantly higher than my minimum value.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still do better. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob is sticking to $12,000. While I would prefer a higher price,  it's still more than John's offer and above my minimum value.  I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
