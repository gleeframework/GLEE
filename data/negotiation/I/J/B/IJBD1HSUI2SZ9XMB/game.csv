"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique benefits and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'd be willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,275,000? It's a strong offer that reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
