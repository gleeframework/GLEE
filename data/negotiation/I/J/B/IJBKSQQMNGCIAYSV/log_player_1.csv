Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 

I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so I won't go below that.  Let's see if Bob is willing to pay a premium!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and get the deal done quickly, $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I believe there's room for a more favorable counteroffer, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000 without trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is a compromise, as it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, Bob sees this as a fair compromise and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $980,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to make one last counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to accept $1,000,000, which is my minimum price and represents the value I place on the product.  If Bob rejects this, I'll move on to selling to John."
