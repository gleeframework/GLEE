{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a good deal while still leaving room for potential profit.  It also sets a clear price point and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and I can likely get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and it's likely he won't come up much higher. Accepting his offer secures a decent profit and avoids further negotiation."
