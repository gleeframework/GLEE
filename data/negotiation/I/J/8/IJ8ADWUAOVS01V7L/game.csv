"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a minimum of $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds significant value for you as well. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which I believe is fair considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to compromise to facilitate this deal. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to work with you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. I'm proposing $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $980,000 is still not quite reaching my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $990,000.  This is a very small difference from your last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to reach an agreement now. ",990000.0,Alice,7,
