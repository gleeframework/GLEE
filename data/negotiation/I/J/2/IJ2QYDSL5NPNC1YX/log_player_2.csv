"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Alice's offer is still higher than the product's value to her ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **Avoiding unnecessary costs:** Buying from John for $1,000,000 would be a worse deal than accepting Alice's offer, so that option is eliminated.

By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price, potentially saving himself some money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you. Let's finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially get a better price."
