Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point: 

* **Price is above Bob's value:**  $10,000 is more than the $8,000 Bob values the product at, so he has some room to negotiate.
* **Price is below your minimum:** It's also below your minimum of $12,000, giving you some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive messaging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** $9,000 is below your minimum desired price of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate with Bob, as he clearly values the product and is willing to pay more than his initial $8,000.
* **Exploring better options:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you can potentially secure a price closer to your desired range. 

Let's see if you can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from your offer.  How about we split the difference at $9,500? This gives you a great deal, and allows me to move closer to my desired price.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. It also positions the offer as a win-win for both parties.
* **Emphasis on value:** The message reinforces the value of the product for Bob while highlighting that the offer is still a good deal for him. 
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** The message maintains a friendly and collaborative approach to encourage Bob to come to an agreement.

This counteroffer is a balanced approach, aiming to secure a price closer to your desired range while keeping the negotiation open with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:** Bob's offer of $9,200 is just $800 away from your minimum desired price of $10,000.
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  It's likely that further negotiation will not result in a significant price increase. There's a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing negotiations will require more time and effort, which could be better spent pursuing other potential buyers. 

While selling to John for $12,000 is ideal, accepting Bob's offer is a good compromise, securing a profitable sale while minimizing further negotiation."
