"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves some room for profit for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you're determined to stay within your budget, and I respect that. I'm also determined to get a fair price for my product.  Let's split the difference and agree on $13,125. This is a small increase from your last offer and still a significant discount from my original price. I believe this is a win-win for both of us.",13125.0,Alice,7,
