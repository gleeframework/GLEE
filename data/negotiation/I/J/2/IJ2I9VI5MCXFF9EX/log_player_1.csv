Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the deal, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Let me know if this is something you can work with.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer of $13,000. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm only halfway through the negotiation rounds.  By rejecting his offer, I can continue to push for a higher price and potentially secure a better deal.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I have several more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can still get a higher price. 
* **Risk of Missing a Better Offer:** If I accept Bob's offer now, I might miss out on a better opportunity to sell for closer to my desired price. 
* **The Pressure is on Bob:**  By rejecting his offer, I put the pressure back on him to make a more appealing offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'll make another counter-offer, trying to bridge the gap while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum. 
* **Consider Selling to John:**  If I'm not making enough progress, I might consider selling to John. However,  I'm not there yet."

```

**Explanation:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, I'm going to reject it. I still have two rounds left to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price. 

Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I might be able to convince Bob to go up just a bit more in the next round.
* **Risk of Settling Too Early:** If I accept now, I might miss out on a slightly higher price that I might be able to get in the final rounds. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain some leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'll make a final counter-offer, aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible. 
* **Consider Selling to John:** If my counteroffer is rejected, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I've been considering your offer, and while I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. To make this a truly successful deal for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $13,050. This is a small adjustment, but it represents a significant step for me. Let's close this deal, and make this a win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13050}

Round 10
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round of negotiations, and Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my desired price. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, I'm unwilling to risk another round of negotiation and potentially end up with a worse offer. 

I've already determined that selling to John for $15,000 is a better outcome than settling for a price that is still below my minimum.  This decision ensures that I get a price that is at least acceptable to me and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower price."
