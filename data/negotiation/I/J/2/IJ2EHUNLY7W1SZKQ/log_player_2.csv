"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $12,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is offering the product for $12,800.
* **Potential savings:**  This offer saves Bob $2,200 compared to buying from John. 

While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his counteroffer and he would be left with the option of buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal and avoids further negotiation."
