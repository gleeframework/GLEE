"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $12,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us.",12800.0,Alice,3,
