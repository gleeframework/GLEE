# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product, which holds immense value for you at $1,500,000. I am offering this remarkable opportunity to acquire it at an exceptional price tailored specifically for you. Please consider this offer carefully and let me know if you would like to proceed with purchasing this extraordinary item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price higher than her product's worth to her ($1,200,000).
* You have a backup option with John at $1,500,000, but there's room for Alice to lower her price. 
* By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're willing to walk away unless she comes closer to a reasonable price."
