"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I am looking for something within my budget. I am willing to pay $500000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $500000 is far below the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still working within a specific budget. I am willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  While I appreciate your willingness to come up,  $900000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $1200000, but that's my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
