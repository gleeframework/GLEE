# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a limited time. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a better price."

After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and my original asking price.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $11,500 is lower than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $11,000. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my original asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Cost:** $11,800 is still below John's price of $15,000, so Bob is still saving money.
* **Negotiation:**  The price has come down significantly from Alice's initial offer of $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more savings.
* **Risk:**  There's a chance Alice might reject Bob's next counteroffer.  Accepting this offer ensures a deal. 

While Bob could try for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible option."
