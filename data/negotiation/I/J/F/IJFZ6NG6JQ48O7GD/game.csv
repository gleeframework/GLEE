"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $60 is significantly below the product's value. I could consider letting it go for $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $130 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go as low as $90.  My final offer is $120.  This is already a very competitive price for what you're getting. Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,5,
