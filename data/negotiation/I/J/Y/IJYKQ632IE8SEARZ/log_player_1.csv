Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me a profit over my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000, which is my minimum value.  This is a fair price considering Bob's valuation and it allows for a smooth transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my minimum value and still yields a profit. While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more in further negotiation, it's likely the bargaining will take longer and might risk Bob walking away. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a reasonable profit."
