"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price that offers significant value to you. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and going with John's offer for $1,500,000 is the best option, even though it's not the absolute lowest price."
