"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I believe it's a great deal, especially considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $90 is higher than your maximum budget of $100. 
* You know you can get the product for $100 from John. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John at your preferred price."
