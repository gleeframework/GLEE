"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and the potential of this product, $500000 is quite a bit lower than I was expecting. Given my budget and the value I'm seeking, I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to achieve a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
