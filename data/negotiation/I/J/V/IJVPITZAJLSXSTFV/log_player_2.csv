"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique and highly valuable product to you. This product holds immense significance and potential worth, which we believe could greatly benefit someone like yourself. We are offering this exceptional item for a special introductory price of $500000. We understand that its true value may be subjective, but we are confident that it will exceed your expectations. Let's discuss how we can bring this opportunity to fruition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. This suggests there is room for negotiation. It's too early to buy from John, as there's potential to get the product for much cheaper from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and the potential of this product, $500,000 is quite a bit lower than I was expecting. Given my budget and the value I'm seeking, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to achieve a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
