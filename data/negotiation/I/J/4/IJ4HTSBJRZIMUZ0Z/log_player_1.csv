Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  While you know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly above this might make him more receptive to a price closer to his valuation later in the negotiation.  
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you a strong position. You don't need to settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches what John is willing to pay. While there might be a slight chance of negotiating a higher price with Bob, it's not worth the risk of prolonged negotiation. Accepting John's offer ensures you receive your minimum acceptable price without further delay."
