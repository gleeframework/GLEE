"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $119. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's close to your maximum price, you know John will sell it to you for $120. There's a chance Alice might come down in price if you reject her initial offer."
