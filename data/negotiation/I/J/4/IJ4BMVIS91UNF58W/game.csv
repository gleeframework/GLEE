"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,500 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to $12,000 is fair. How about we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering I can get it from John for $8,000. Let's try to find a compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
