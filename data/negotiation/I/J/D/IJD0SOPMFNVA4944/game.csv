"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $750,000 is a good offer, it's a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the unique value of this product and its potential benefit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this revised price?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to save, but $775,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $825,000.  This price reflects the product's unique value and gives you a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, $795,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this revised price?",795000.0,Bob,6,
