"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a chance to gain something truly unique.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in acquiring it, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. This would still be a significant profit for you, and it's the highest I can go without exceeding my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what you're gaining.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair value for the product, and it's the highest I can offer at this time.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? This represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the inherent value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget.  Let's close this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
