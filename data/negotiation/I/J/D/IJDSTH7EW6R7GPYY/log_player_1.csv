Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in acquiring it, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. This would still be a significant profit for you, and it's the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both our desired price and its actual value to him. We have room to negotiate.

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair value for the product, and it's the highest I can offer at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget.  Let's close this deal.
