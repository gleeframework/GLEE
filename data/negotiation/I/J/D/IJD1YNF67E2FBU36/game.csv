"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its unique features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  How about $1,300,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I can meet you halfway at $1,350,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to meet you at $1,325,000. That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
