Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, knowing that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good price. 
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the deal. This helps to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By not starting at the absolute maximum, I leave room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's being pushed around.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still leaving room for a potential win-win outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than $10,000, I'm still confident that I can get a better price.  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it's still fair considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer of $12,000 splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, reminding him that $12,000 is still a good price for him.
* **Positive tone:**  My message is still friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation process positive and productive.

I believe that this counteroffer is fair and likely to be accepted by Bob, as it's a good compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and do $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's only $500 less than my previous offer, and it's significantly better than the $10,000 I would receive from John. It's time to accept the deal and move on.  Further negotiation might take more time and may not result in a significantly higher price."
