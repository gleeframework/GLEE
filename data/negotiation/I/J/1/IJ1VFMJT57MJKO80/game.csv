"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 90 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 85. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my original offer of $75. If you're not willing to go lower than $85, I'm going to have to consider other options.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for 82. It's a great value, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,5,
