"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this unique product.  I value it highly, but I believe its true worth will be realized in your hands. To start the negotiation, I propose a price of $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high to establish a strong initial position. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $500,000 above Bob's perceived value allows for a potential compromise that still benefits me significantly.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the product's unique nature and Bob's potential gain, creating a more compelling case."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my current financial situation, I can only offer $1,200,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant profit, it's still considerably less than my initial asking price. Bob's message suggests he understands the product's value and might be willing to negotiate further. I'll counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls short of what I believe the product is truly worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message conveys flexibility but reinforces the product's value. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I want to keep the negotiation going, as I believe there's still room for a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. This is my best offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,300,000 represents a $300,000 profit, which is substantial.
* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob has indicated this is his best offer within his budget.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or push him away. 
* **Time Value:**  While I have rounds remaining, securing a deal now has value.  There's always a risk Bob might walk away later, and John's offer provides a safety net but not the upside potential."
