Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this unique product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth even more than my asking price.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob allows me to potentially maximize my profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant profit margin for me while still offering Bob a $50,000 discount on his perceived value. 
* **Open Communication:**  The message is framed to encourage a positive response and potential counter-offer from Bob."
