"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm looking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is your maximum, starting the negotiation at that price gives Alice no incentive to lower her price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start making counteroffers and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $80? "", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:**  A significant counteroffer (20% lower) shows you're serious about negotiating. 
* **Be polite:**  Maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Justify your offer:** Mention that you're interested to show good faith, but emphasize that you're looking for a better price."
