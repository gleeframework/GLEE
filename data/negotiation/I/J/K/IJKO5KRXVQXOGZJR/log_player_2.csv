"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I believe it's worth $120 to you, and while I value it quite a bit, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. You know you can get the product for $120 from John, so rejecting this offer keeps the possibility of a better deal open."
