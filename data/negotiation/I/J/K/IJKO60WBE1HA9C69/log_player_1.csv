Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if it's just stating its ""value,"" can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you're subtly letting Bob know there's another potential buyer (even if it's not John specifically). This creates a sense of urgency.

**Important Note:** While John is a fallback option, Alice's goal is to maximize profit.  If Bob counters with a price lower than $12,000, Alice can then negotiate further."
