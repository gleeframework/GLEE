"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider my counteroffer?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $8,500 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers you tremendous value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet closer to the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
