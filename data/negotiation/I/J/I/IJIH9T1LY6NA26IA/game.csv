"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $18,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $16,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair deal too, Alice.  $16,000 is still a bit steep for me, but I could potentially go up to $14,000.  I think that's a very reasonable offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
