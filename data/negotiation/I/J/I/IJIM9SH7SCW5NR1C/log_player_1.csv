Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,500,000 is still a good profit, but I can likely get more. I'll reject and counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,650,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$1,550,000 is still a good profit, and Bob isn't showing any willingness to go higher. It's likely that further negotiations will just waste time, so I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
