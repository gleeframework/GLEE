Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000. However, my budget remains firm at $800,000. This is a fair price considering my specific needs and the value I place on the product. Let's try to find common ground. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge from his $800,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. Accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
