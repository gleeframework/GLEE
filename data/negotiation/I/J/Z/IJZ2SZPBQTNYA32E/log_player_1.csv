Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175, slightly above Bob's value for the product.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully earn a profit.  I'm not going too high, as I don't want to risk him rejecting my offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $160. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $155 is only slightly below what I could get from John. It's better to take the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  I'd rather secure a profit than gamble on a better offer."
