"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to leave room for negotiation.  Since I know the product is worth $150 to me, I'm hoping to get close to that amount. However, I'm also leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer, which I'll evaluate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell the product at a substantial loss. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering with $160. This is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, indicating my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this price point is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but also allows me to secure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is now within my acceptable range, exceeding my minimum price of $150. It's still a bit lower than my desired price, but I'm willing to accept it considering the limited rounds remaining.  I'm also taking into account the risk of losing a deal entirely if I reject Bob's offer and then fail to reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
