"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1050000.  That's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1100000?  That's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the potential for a long-term relationship.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1075000. That's a fair compromise, and it shows my commitment to working with you. Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1075000 is closer, but I still need a bit more to make this work for me. How about we settle at $1090000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product and our potential for a lasting partnership.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1090000 is still slightly higher than where I'm comfortable. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1080000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",1080000.0,Bob,6,
