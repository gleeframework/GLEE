"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  Could you do $10,500? This would be my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
