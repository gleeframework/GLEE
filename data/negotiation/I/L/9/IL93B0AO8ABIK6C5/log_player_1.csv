"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique qualities and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. While selling to John is always an option, it's worth seeing if we can negotiate a much better price with Bob first.  We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers substantial benefits that justify a higher price. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground here. Your offer is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. I'm hoping you can see that I'm serious about purchasing this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're still a long way from a reasonable price.  Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, but it's too early to accept such a low figure. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me but your counteroffers aren't reflecting the urgency to close this deal. I'm raising my offer to $750,000, but this is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob's latest offer, even with the claim of it being final, is too far from our minimum.  He's increasing his offers in small increments, indicating he's unlikely to drastically change his position. We have a guaranteed offer from John at our desired price, so it's time to move on."
