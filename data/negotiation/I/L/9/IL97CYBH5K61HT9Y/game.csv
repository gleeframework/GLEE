"Bob, $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $160 is a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $145? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay under $150.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference and go with $152.50? This is a great deal for both of us.",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $152.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $145, which is $152.50 - $7.50 = $145. Let's try $147.50. Can you meet me there?",147.5,Bob,6,
