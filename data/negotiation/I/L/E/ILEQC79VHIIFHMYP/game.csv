"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $750,000.

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $675,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of investing in it. Let me know what you think!",675000.0,Alice,3,
