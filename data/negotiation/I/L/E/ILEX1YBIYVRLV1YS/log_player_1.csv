Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves you some room to make concessions if needed.
* **It's a round number:** This makes the offer seem more concrete and easy to understand.

By offering a price that is above Bob's perceived value, you can increase the chances of him accepting the offer, especially if he sees the value of the product close to your valuation. If he rejects, you can then gauge his interest and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to counteroffer with a higher price. I believe there's still room for us to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
