Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is a price higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message makes Bob feel comfortable and more likely to engage in a negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message subtly implies the product is valuable by saying it would be ""perfect"" for Bob.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** A higher starting price gives me more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** A friendly approach makes him more likely to counteroffer, potentially leading to a higher final price. 
* **Maintain bargaining power:** By not immediately accepting John's $80 offer, I can see if I can do better with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Close:** Bob's offer of $90 is just $10 below my initial offer.  This is a small enough difference that it's worth accepting, especially since I can't be sure of getting a better deal in future rounds.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will walk away or I might get stuck accepting John's lower offer of $80.
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to quickly finalize the sale and move on. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting $90 is a good compromise that secures a profit and avoids potential losses."
