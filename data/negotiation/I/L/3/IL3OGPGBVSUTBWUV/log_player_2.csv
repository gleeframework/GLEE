"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is less than the $120 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to his maximum budget while still leaving room for Alice to make a profit.  Offering $85 is a good starting point for counter-negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $85. While it's still below John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from $85 to $88, showing willingness to compromise but still aiming for a price lower than Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget. However, it's still higher than the price Bob is willing to pay.  He should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but he's still trying to save as much money as possible.  Offering $90 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway, but it's still below Alice's last offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $97 is getting dangerously close to Bob's maximum budget of $120. While he could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will continue to raise the price, eventually exceeding Bob's budget. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $120, ensuring a purchase within his budget rather than risking a higher price with Alice."
