Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value from selling to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (if he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that $200,000 potential profit as possible without pushing Bob to reject the offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a still-significant $50,000 gain. 
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""unique value proposition"" and ""confident it will exceed your expectations"" reinforce the product's worth.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only other option) could encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive approach might be preferable."
