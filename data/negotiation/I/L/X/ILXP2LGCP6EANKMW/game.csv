"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still too low for me.  How about $95? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it gives you a good deal. Let's close this deal!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's split the difference and make this happen.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up.  $90 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $92?  It's a small difference, and it shows that we're both making compromises.  Let's make this deal happen.",92.0,Alice,5,
