"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness and value it brings. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500000 is unfortunately far below the product's true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects its potential.  I'm prepared to lower my offer to $1750000. This price still allows for a substantial profit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $800000. I believe this strikes a balance between value and affordability for me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $800000 simply doesn't cover the product's inherent value.  I'm trying to be reasonable here, and I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still significantly below the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to make one final concession, but it's crucial that we find a price that reflects its potential. I'm ready to offer it to you for $1100000. This price is a considerable compromise on my part, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in accepting it.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm committed to selling this product to you, but I can't go any lower than $1075000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I hope you'll see it as a fair deal given the value of the product. This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
