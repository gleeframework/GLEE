{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I've chosen $115 as my initial offer. It's a fair price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
