"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are trying to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's still a little above your ideal price, but it's within your budget and saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
