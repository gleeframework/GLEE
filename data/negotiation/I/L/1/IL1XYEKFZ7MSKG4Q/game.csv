,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is there any flexibility on the price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
