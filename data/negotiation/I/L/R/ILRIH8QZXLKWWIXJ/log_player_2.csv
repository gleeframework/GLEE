# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that is worth exactly that to you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can save money by simply buying from John."
