Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Showing flexibility:**  Adding ""I'm open to negotiating"" shows that I'm willing to compromise, making Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Positive framing:**  Highlighting the product's value (""amazing product"") can make Bob more inclined to accept.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiation or if I should sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my desired price:**  $90 is only $10 below my initial offer and significantly higher than John's offer of $80.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely and being forced to sell to John for a lower price.

**Next steps:**

* I'll finalize the sale with Bob and get paid!"
