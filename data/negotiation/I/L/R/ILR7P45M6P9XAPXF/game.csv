"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer for it?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1500000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm interested in exploring a lower price point. How about $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $1200000 is too high, but $1050000 is a more reasonable compromise?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the value of this product and the time I've invested in it. How about we meet at $1000000? I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1000000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $900000.  This is a fair price for the value I'm getting, and it's the most I can afford.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on $900000, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to know that you're willing to meet me halfway. How about we compromise at $950000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go to $925000 as a final compromise.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of this product.  Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $975000? It's a small increment from your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",975000.0,Alice,9,
