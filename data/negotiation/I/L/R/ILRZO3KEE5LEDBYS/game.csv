,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for this product, as it aligns with my valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider a price of $900,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still above my maximum. I'm prepared to offer $750,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
