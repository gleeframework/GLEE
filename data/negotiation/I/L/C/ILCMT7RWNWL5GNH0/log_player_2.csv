"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, which I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, which is a steal considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price. Alice might come back with a lower offer, getting you closer to her $8,000 valuation. 

You always have the safety net of buying from John at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate with Alice."
