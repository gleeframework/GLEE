"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I cannot disclose the specifics at this time, I assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, especially since Alice thinks it's only worth $1,000,000 to her. I'd rather buy it from John for $1,200,000.
