Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already told you, Bob, I won't go below $90. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. If you're willing to meet me at $90, I'll consider it. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.

It's time to cut bait.  Alice has made it clear she won't go below $90, and you have a guaranteed option at $80 with John.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation."
