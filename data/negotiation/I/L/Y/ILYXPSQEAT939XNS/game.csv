"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a competitive price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $14,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit off from my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a fair price that's closer to what I'm looking for.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $13,750? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",13750.0,Alice,7,
