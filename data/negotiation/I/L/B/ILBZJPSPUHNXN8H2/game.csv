"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this would be a beneficial acquisition for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet at $1,025,000? This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,025,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it's a bit high. Could we perhaps meet somewhere around $975,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise considering my financial constraints.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make one final concession to bridge that gap. If you're able to agree to $1,000,000, we have a deal.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $980,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
