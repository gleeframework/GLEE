"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to consider that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175. This gives you a good price and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down. $175 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $150?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
