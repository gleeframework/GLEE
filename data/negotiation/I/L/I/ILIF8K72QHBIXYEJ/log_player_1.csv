"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,450,000, reflecting its significant value. I believe this price is fair and offers a strong return on investment. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as an opportunity, highlighting the product's value and potential for Bob. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, suggesting a discussion. 

This approach aims to secure a good price while establishing a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1450000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $1,300,000 is below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer is too low to accept at this stage.  
* **Exploring a higher counteroffer:** I believe I can secure a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,300,000 is tempting, it doesn't quite reflect the full potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000,  This represents a significant value for you and allows me to move closer to my price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential for a strong return on investment.
* **Focus on common ground:** I'm emphasizing finding a solution that benefits both of us, creating a collaborative tone.

This approach aims to secure a higher price while maintaining a positive and flexible negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1400000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1350000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $1,350,000 remains below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of potential profit.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Even though we're nearing the middle ground, there's still room for Bob to increase his offer. I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum just yet.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and aim for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me to consider. Given the product's value and our ongoing discussions, I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a strong opportunity for you. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above minimum:** I'm keeping my offer above my minimum of $1,500,000 but showing a willingness to compromise further. 
* **Smaller increment:** I'm proposing a smaller increment than before ($75,000) to signal that I'm nearing my final position.
* **Highlighting fair compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my target price while maintaining a positive and reasonable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1425000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1350000. If you're open to that price, we can close this deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:** Bob is firm on his offer of $1,350,000, which is still below my minimum.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a higher price.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.  
* **Time is limited:**  We're approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John. 

Selling to John is the most secure and profitable option at this point."
