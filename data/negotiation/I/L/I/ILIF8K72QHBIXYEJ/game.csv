"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1450000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1300000 is tempting, it doesn't quite reflect the full potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000,  This represents a significant value for you and allows me to move closer to my price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1400000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1350000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point to reach a deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still a bit too low for me to consider. Given the product's value and our ongoing discussions, I'm willing to come down to $1425000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a strong opportunity for you. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1425000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1350000. If you're open to that price, we can close this deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
