"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $120, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating.  There are 9 more rounds, and Bob can always buy from John for $100 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $105?  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** Bob wants to get the product as close to his $100 limit as possible.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  A counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Keeping Options Open:** Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while also reminding Alice that he has an alternative option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $110.  It's a great product, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of use out of it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial $115, there's still room for a better price for Bob. He's only $10 away from his target price of $100, and there are 7 rounds remaining. 
* **Don't Rush:**  It's too early to accept the offer. Bob can potentially push for a lower price with a counteroffer. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The option to buy from John for $100 provides a safety net if negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still keen on getting this product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $107.50.  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** Bob is proposing a price halfway between his previous offer ($105) and Alice's current offer ($110).  This shows a willingness to compromise while still working toward his goal.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** The offer of $107.50 keeps the negotiation moving forward, but also leaves some room for Alice to make a small counteroffer in the next round if necessary. 
* **Staying within Budget:**  Bob is still within his $100 budget, but is also getting closer to Alice's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $112.50. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice's offer of $112.50 is getting closer to Bob's target, but there's still a $12.50 difference.
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:**  There are 5 rounds remaining.  Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $100 provides a safety net, giving Bob the confidence to keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a lower price.  How about $109.50?  That's a good price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 109.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost There:** Bob is getting very close to his target price of $100. A counteroffer of $109.50 is a compromise, but still keeps him within a reasonable range.
* **Closing Pressure:** By suggesting it's a good price for both and emphasizing closing the deal, Bob is applying a bit of pressure on Alice to accept. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob needs to make progress towards a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $111 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe you'll be satisfied with it. It's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While Alice's offer is tempting, Bob is still only $11 away from his target price of $100. With 3 rounds remaining, there's still potential to get a better deal.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Bob can always buy from John for $100 if negotiations fail. This provides him with the confidence to push for a lower price from Alice. 
* **Strategic counteroffers:**  Bob can likely counter with a price closer to his target and potentially get Alice to meet him in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $111 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $108.50 - that's just a little more than my last offer.  Let's see if we can finally agree on a price."", ""product_price"": 108.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob is making a final push to get closer to his target price. He is only $3.50 away from his goal of $105. 
* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  Offering $108.50 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strategic position.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 2 rounds left, Bob needs to make a significant move to reach an agreement. 
* **John's Option:** The safety net of John's offer allows Bob to be more assertive in his counteroffer."
