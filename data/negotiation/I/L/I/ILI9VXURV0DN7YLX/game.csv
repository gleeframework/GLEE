"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise closer to my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think $9,500 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
