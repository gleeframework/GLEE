"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be of immense value to you.  Based on its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to achieve my target.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $1,300,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, and I respect that. However, $1,250,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the significant value this product holds, and it leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1,300,000 or lower. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
