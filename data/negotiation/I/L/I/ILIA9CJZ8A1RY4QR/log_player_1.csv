{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a better profit.
* **Finding a Balance:** $125 is a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) while still being significantly lower than your guaranteed sale price ($150).
* **Encouraging Acceptance:**  The message frames the price as a ""special deal,"" potentially making Bob more inclined to accept. 

This offer attempts to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing your potential profit."
