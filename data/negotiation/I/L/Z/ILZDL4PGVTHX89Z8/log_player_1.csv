"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value while leaving room for negotiation.  This sets a strong starting point and allows for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is above my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the initial round, but staying above Bob's offer.  This demonstrates flexibility while still pushing for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $825,000, but I'm running out of rounds. I'll see if I can push Bob higher in the next round, but I'm getting close to my minimum and might need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's last offer and my minimum.  I'm trying to reach a compromise while still leaving some room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm at my minimum price.  There's a high chance Bob won't increase his offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
