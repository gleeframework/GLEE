Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, the price John will pay.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($150) leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up, should he be inclined.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $149 creates a perception of being significantly cheaper than $150.

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
