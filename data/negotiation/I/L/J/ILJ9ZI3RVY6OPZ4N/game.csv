"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,100,000. This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in your product but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $1,075,000?  This is a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $1,075,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,087,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think!",1087500.0,Alice,5,
