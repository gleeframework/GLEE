"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great price considering its value, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,100,000. This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still above my target. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can close the gap. There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $1,075,000?  This is a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $1,075,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,087,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we are very close to my target price. Accepting her offer at $1,087,500 means I'm only paying $87,500 more than my absolute limit with John.  Considering the time remaining and the potential for further negotiation, it's a good deal for me."
