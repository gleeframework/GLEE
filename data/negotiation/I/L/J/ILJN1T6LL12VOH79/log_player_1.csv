Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offering $14,000:** This price is higher than Bob's valuation of $12,000, but lower than my own minimum of $15,000. This creates a potential win-win scenario.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **""Let me know what you think"":**  This invites Bob to respond and potentially negotiate.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize profit:** This price gives me a good profit while still being attractive to Bob. 
* **Maintain backup option:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum desired price.
* **Negotiation possibility:**  By leaving room for negotiation, I might be able to secure a higher price if Bob is interested."
