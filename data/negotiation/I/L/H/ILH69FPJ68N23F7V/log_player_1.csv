Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's fantastic and would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $150, giving you some negotiating power.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $175 allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer or feel like he's getting a deal if he accepts the initial price.
* **Maximizing Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed $150 from John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a larger profit.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject $175. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk of losing the sale to Bob in this scenario."
