"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be interested in buying your product for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives us both a fair profit.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,500.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
