"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000.

"I understand that you're still trying to negotiate a lower price, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering $1075000 earlier.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm going to try to get closer to my minimum price. My revised offer is $1125000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling the product to another buyer.",1125000.0,Alice,9,,
