"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make you a fair offer of $600000 for it. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product, which is still a significant gain for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
