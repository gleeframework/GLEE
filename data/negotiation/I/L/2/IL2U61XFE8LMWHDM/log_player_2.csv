"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make you a fair offer of $600000 for it. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($600,000 vs. $800,000). It's a good starting point for negotiation, but Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, which is still a significant gain for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $750000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counter-offer of $750,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's target price of $700,000 and still represents a significant savings compared to buying from John for $800,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product while saving a substantial amount of money."
