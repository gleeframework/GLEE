"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum price point, so please let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1100000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $1100000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $950000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
