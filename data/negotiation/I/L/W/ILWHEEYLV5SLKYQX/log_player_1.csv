""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation. 
* **Negotiation Room:** A high starting price leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving Alice the opportunity to lower the price slightly and still secure a price significantly higher than $15,000. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John. This means she's in a strong position and doesn't need to desperately lowball Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has some reason to believe Bob might value the product higher than $8,000 (e.g., it's a niche product, Bob expressed strong interest, etc.). If Alice is confident $8,000 is Bob's absolute ceiling, it might be wiser to start lower, closer to $15,000."
