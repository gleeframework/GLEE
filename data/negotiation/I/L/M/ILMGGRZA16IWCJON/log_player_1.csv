"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $22,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to offer much more than $12,000. While we could continue negotiating, it's risky to hope he'll reach our minimum acceptable price of $15,000. John's guaranteed offer ensures we get our minimum and avoids further time spent negotiating."
