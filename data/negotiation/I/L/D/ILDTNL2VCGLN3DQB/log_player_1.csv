Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate (if he wishes) while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to make the price more justifiable.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or alternative options. In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about the buyer's position can lead to a more tailored and potentially more profitable approach."
