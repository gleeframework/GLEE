"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I understand the product's value, but I'm only able to offer $700,000 at this time.  I'm confident this is still a fair price given the potential return on investment.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  This product has incredible potential and I'm confident it will generate substantial returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to split the difference and offer $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential return, and I believe it's a good compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,
