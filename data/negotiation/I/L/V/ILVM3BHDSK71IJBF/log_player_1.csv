Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob.  Here's why:

* **My Minimum:** I'm getting $400,000 more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob still gets a $100,000 benefit by buying from me compared to his alternative (finding another product for $1,500,000). 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.

This approach balances maximizing my gain with the likelihood of Bob accepting the deal."
