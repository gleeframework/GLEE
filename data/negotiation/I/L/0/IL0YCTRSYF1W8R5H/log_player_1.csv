I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to get a good initial negotiation point.  I'll be prepared to adjust the price based on Bob's response and the possibility of selling to John as a backup plan."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $900,000 just yet. I'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a price closer to my initial asking price."

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum than before, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer once more and see if we can reach a final agreement.  If not, I'll sell to John and guarantee my minimum value."
