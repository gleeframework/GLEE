"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is lower than John's price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is polite and expresses continued interest.  While the offer is low, it's not offensively so, given that it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product.
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to get the product as close to Alice's value ($120) as possible, maximizing my savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $110 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a very good price. It's only $5 above Alice's perceived value and significantly lower than John's offer of $150.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice's willingness to meet in the middle suggests she's motivated to sell. While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of her withdrawing the offer.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time. Accepting now secures a good deal and allows me to move on."
