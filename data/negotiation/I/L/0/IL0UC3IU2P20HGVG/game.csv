"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit low for me. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the final offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1050000. I'm willing to go up to $1020000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope you can understand my position.",1020000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you've reached your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I can offer it to you for $1030000. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
