Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another party."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,500,000, getting a higher price from Bob is ideal.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **Bob's Perspective:** He gains $400,000 in value ($1,400,000 offer vs. his $1,000,000 valuation).
    * **Alice's Perspective:** She earns $100,000 more than her guaranteed sale to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another offer incentivizes Bob to act quickly.

This approach balances maximizing profit with a realistic chance of Bob accepting the offer."
