Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's true value is considerably higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $750,000.  It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
