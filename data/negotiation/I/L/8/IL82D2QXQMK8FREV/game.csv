"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm not sure $12,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a significant discount from the initial offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering your profit and my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I need to make a living, and $10,250 is still a bit short for me. I can offer you the product for $11,500, which is the highest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",11500.0,Alice,5,
