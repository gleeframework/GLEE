"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You get the product for $9,000, which is within your budget and saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John:** This would cost you $10,000, which is your maximum budget.  It's unnecessary to spend more when you can get it cheaper from Alice."
