Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Safety Net:** We have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly highlights the product's value to justify the high price without revealing Bob's maximum perceived value. 

This strategy balances ambition with a fallback option, maximizing the chances of a profitable sale."
