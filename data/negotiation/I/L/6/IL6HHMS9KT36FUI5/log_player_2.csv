"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and proceeding to a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a tactic to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground. The offer is still within Bob's budget, making it a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. There are still several rounds remaining, and he has the option to buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing that he is willing to negotiate but also remaining firm within his budget. The offer is still lower than Alice's last price, but it's closer to a potential middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget.  While he could continue negotiating and risk potentially getting a lower price, there's also the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and ending up with no deal.  Given that he can buy the product from John for the same price, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice in this round.  This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget without risking further negotiation."
