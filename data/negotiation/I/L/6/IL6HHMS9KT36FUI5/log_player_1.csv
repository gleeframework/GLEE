"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $14,000. This is above Bob's valuation, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it's still above Bob's valuation and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. I'm hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it. If he rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
