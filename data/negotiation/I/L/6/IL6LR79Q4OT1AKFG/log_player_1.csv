I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but still allows me to potentially make significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit, while also showing that I'm serious about making a deal."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, it's still a better outcome than selling to John and it saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
