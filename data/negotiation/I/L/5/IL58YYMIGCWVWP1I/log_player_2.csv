Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $100, Bob, but I was really hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price of $120. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $108? This is the best I can do at this point.

Alice is unlikely to go below $108.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $120 than to risk a worse deal with Alice."
