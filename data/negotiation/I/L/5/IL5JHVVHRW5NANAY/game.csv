"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $987,500. This is a fair compromise that allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget.  What are your thoughts?",987500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $987,500 is a tempting offer, I'm still confident this product is worth more.  How about $1,005,000? This slight adjustment reflects its true potential while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1005000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely narrowing the gap.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about $1,000,000? This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Bob,6,
