"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is significantly higher than Alice's valuation of $800,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if Alice will come down in price.
* **John's offer is a fallback.** You have the option to buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails, so you're not in a desperate position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering $850,000, which is halfway between Alice's valuation of $800,000 and my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Reasonable compromise:** This price reflects a willingness to compromise, but it still gives me a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is higher than my previous offer.** She's not coming down in price, and this is a sign that she's not willing to negotiate much.
* **John's offer is still an option.** I can still buy from John for $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept a price that's not favorable.
* **More room for negotiation.**  I have 7 rounds left. I'll see if I can get Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to $900,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint:** This offer is still closer to Alice's valuation ($800,000) than my initial counteroffer ($850,000). 
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway or if she's more rigid in her price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** She's not budging from her initial high price point, despite my attempts to negotiate.
* **John's offer remains a backup plan.** I'm not desperate to buy from Alice at this price.
* **Time to apply pressure:** I have 5 rounds left. I'll try a lower counteroffer to see if I can force Alice to reconsider."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower counteroffer:** I'm lowering my offer to $875,000, which is closer to Alice's valuation and is still a significant saving for me.
* **Pressure tactic:** This lower offer might make Alice realize that she needs to be more flexible to close the deal.
* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the negotiation, and I need to start seeing progress."

Round 7

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging.**  She's consistently offering prices above what I'm willing to pay.
* **Time is running out.**  I only have 3 rounds left, and there's no sign that Alice is willing to meet me halfway.
* **John's offer is the best option.**  While it's not ideal, it's the most reliable way to ensure I get the product within the allotted rounds. Buying from John guarantees the deal, and I can still save a significant amount of money compared to Alice's latest offer."
