"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and it lets me get closer to my asking price.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle again at $100?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $100. I'd be willing to pay $92 for it.",92.0,Bob,6,
