"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $150, and Alice is selling it for $120. This means you're saving $30 compared to buying from John. 
* **Even though you'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer is still within your budget.**  You're willing to spend up to $150, and Alice's offer is below that."
