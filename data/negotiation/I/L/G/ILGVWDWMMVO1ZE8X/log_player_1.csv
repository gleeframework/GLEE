"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit. I'm confident the product is worth more than $15,000 to Bob, and I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired amount. I believe this is a fair compromise and that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. With 6 rounds left, I have time to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer to Bob.  I'm dropping the price to $15,500, which is still higher than what John would pay.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'm going to sell the product to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. I'd rather secure the deal with John now and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
