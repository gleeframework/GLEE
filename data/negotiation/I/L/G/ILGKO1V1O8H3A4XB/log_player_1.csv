Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much money from Bob as possible, exceeding our minimum price of $150.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting at $140 is higher than Bob's valuation, it allows room for him to counter-offer. This leaves the door open for a price that's higher than $120 but potentially lower than $140, still netting us a profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
