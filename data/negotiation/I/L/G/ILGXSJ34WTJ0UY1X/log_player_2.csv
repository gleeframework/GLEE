"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $100.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $92 is closer to your goal, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. Since you can get the product from John for $80, it's the most sensible option to go with John."
