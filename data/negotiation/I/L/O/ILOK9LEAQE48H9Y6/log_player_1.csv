Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even exceeding $1,500,000.  I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very competitive offer. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  
* **Justification for Value:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob exceeding his perceived $1,500,000 helps justify a higher asking price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is significantly above Bob's valuation, it leaves space for negotiation if he counters. You can always come down in price, but you can't go up from your initial offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial deal."
