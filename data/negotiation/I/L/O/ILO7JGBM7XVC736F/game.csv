"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $880000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll consider $875000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
