Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,000 to make this work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet at $8,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I need to keep trying to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer Bob again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $8,500 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,800. This is my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, this is your chance to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $8,600, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to run out of time, $8,600 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I need to see if I can get closer to my goal before resorting to selling to John. I'll counteroffer Bob once more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,600 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you halfway at $8,700. This is my absolute final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,700. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time and Bob seems to be stuck at $8,500.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While it's not ideal, it's better than settling for a significantly lower price."
