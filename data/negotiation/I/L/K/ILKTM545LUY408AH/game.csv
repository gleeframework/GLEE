"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,000 to make this work. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet at $8,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $8,500 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,800. This is my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, this is your chance to close the deal.",8800.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,600 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you halfway at $8,700. This is my absolute final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, let's close this deal now.",8700.0,Alice,7,
