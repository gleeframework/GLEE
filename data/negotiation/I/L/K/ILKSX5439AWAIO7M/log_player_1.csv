"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product but need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate you being upfront. I'm willing to come down a little bit but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 110}
