"Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $10000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $10000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $17000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10000.  Let's see if we can find a solution.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your budget.  While I'm still confident this product is worth more than $10000, I'm willing to go down to $15000 to finalize this deal.  This is the lowest I can go, and I'd hate to miss out on the opportunity to work with you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but unfortunately, $15000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I can only offer $10000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,6,
