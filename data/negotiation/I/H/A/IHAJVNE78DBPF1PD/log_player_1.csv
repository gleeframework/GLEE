Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm at $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $975,000 offer.  While continuing the negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, it's risky. Accepting John's offer for the full $1,200,000 guarantees the best possible outcome at this point."
