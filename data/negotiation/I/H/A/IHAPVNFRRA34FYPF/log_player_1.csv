Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher initially allows you to potentially earn more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a ""deal"" while still securing a good profit if he accepts.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
