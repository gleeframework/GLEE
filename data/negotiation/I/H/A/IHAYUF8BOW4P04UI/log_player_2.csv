While my asking price is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make this a win-win and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties.

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  You're better off going with John's deal."
