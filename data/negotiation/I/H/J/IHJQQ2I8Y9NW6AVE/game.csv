"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while remaining within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm unable to accept $10,000 for the product. Based on its value to you and its intrinsic worth, I propose we settle on $11,000. This price reflects a compromise that allows you to acquire the product while ensuring a reasonable return for us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
