"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I believe it aligns well with your needs and expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm unable to accept $10,000 for the product. Based on its value to you and its intrinsic worth, I propose we settle on $11,000. This price reflects a compromise that allows you to acquire the product while ensuring a reasonable return for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still better than John's price of $15,000.  While Bob might be able to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will walk away and Bob would then be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
