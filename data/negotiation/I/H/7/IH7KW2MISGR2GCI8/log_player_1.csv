"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While I'm eager to sell, $75 is below my minimum price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $75 is just too low for me. How about $85? This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'll offer $80.  This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and it makes sense to close the deal now. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
