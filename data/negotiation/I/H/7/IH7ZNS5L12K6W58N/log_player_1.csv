"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:** I highlight the product's value to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  By starting high, I aim to secure a price closer to my minimum desired amount. 
* **Encourage negotiation:**  This approach sets the stage for a back-and-forth exchange that could lead to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Keep John's offer as a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always switch to John and secure my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $15,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price at this stage, especially since I have John's offer as a backup. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm looking for something closer to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm staying firm on my minimum price, but acknowledging Bob's interest and demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Bridging the gap:**  $11,000 represents a significant compromise from my initial offer but is still a respectable distance from Bob's counter-offer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** This counter-offer keeps my options open, allowing me to potentially secure a better price while still keeping John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum desired value, it's still not ideal. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, given that Bob is showing continued interest. 

Rejecting the offer keeps my options open. If I can successfully negotiate a higher price in the next round, I'll be in a better position. However, if Bob becomes too stubborn or I feel like I'm getting nowhere, I can always opt to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,500? I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintaining momentum:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's progress while showing that I'm still seeking a slightly higher price.
* **Splitting the difference:** Offering a middle ground price is a common negotiation tactic, often perceived as fair and reasonable.
* **Staying within my range:** $10,500 is still above my minimum desired value, ensuring I don't sell below my minimum.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  By sticking to my desired range and finding common ground, I'm trying to get the best possible price.
* **Maintain negotiation flow:** This keeps the conversation going, potentially leading to a successful deal. 
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but no more. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, but his offer is still below my desired price. However, we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. If I reject this offer, I risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for my minimum price. Accepting Bob's offer at $10,000 ensures I secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal completely. 

While I would prefer a higher price, I recognize that further negotiation may not be fruitful, and the potential for a better price is low given Bob's stance. Therefore, accepting the offer is the most pragmatic decision to make in this round."
