"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm looking for something closer to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,500? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but no more. Can you meet me there?",10000.0,Bob,6,
