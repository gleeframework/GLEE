"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $1350000? It's a compromise that still allows both of us to walk away happy.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1300000. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
