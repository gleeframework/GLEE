"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room for negotiation. Let's counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,130,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1130000
}
```

We're aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's offer.  There's still potential for a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. We're willing to be patient for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,110,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

We're splitting the difference between our last offer and his to signal we're serious about closing the deal but not willing to drop too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we'd ideally like to get more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,060,000 secures a profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
