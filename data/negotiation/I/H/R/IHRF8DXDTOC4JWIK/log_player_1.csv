Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Starting High:**  A starting price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, even if Bob perceives its worth as lower.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $15,000.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk of going straight to your backup buyer."
