Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer.  While continuing to negotiate *might* yield a slightly better price, it's risky. Accepting her offer of $12,250 is a significant jump from your last offer, and she seems firm. Buying from John at $15,000 is not ideal, but it guarantees you get the product and provides a clear stopping point to avoid potentially overpaying."
