"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be open to that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? That's my final offer.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12250.0,Alice,7,
