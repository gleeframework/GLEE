Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently increasing his offer amount, indicating a strong interest in the product. We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and I believe I can secure a better price by continuing to counter.  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's potential to get closer to that figure with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's settle this now. I'm willing to accept $955,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 955000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

By round 7, it's strategic to signal a degree of finality to encourage Bob to reach a decision. By stating this is my final offer and offering a price slightly above his last offer, I am hoping he will recognize the deal and take it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your final offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline. I am prepared to pay $945,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $945,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $945,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has not significantly increased his offer despite my ""final offer"" in the previous round. This suggests he is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting his current offer would result in a $55,000 loss compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
