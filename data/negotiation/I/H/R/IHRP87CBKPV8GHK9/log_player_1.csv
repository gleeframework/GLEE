"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to compromise.  I also want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,100,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation.  I believe this price is still attractive to Bob, who values the product at $800,000, and gets me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal for both of us.  He's offering a price that's above his valuation, and I'm getting closer to my desired price with each round.  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  I'd rather lock in this deal and secure the $950,000."
