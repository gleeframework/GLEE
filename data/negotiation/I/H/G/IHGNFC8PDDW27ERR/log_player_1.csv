"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth a lot to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further rounds of negotiation.  Selling to John right now would be the safest option, but I'm hoping to potentially earn even more by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still interested in the product. Can we meet at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $900,000.  Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room for a higher price.  I'm going to push for a slightly higher offer in the next round, but I'm also keeping the option to sell to John in mind if this negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to stay within my budget. Can we try $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is getting closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly below my desired price point. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I'm not willing to compromise further without a significant counter-offer from Bob.  I'm going to try one more counter-offer to see if I can push Bob towards a more acceptable price, but I'm also preparing to sell to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $850,000.  This is the lowest I can go, but it still allows for a fair return on my investment.  If you're truly interested, I encourage you to reconsider."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $820,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of time, and while $820,000 is close to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I've made significant concessions, and Bob is demonstrating a reluctance to budge further. With only two rounds left, I'm not confident that I can reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which ensures a more profitable outcome for me."
