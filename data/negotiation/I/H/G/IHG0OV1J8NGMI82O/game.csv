"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,250,000? I appreciate your understanding.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still below what I need to accept. I understand you're working within a budget, but my product's value warrants a price closer to $1,500,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've been considering your product carefully, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I propose $1,350,000 as a compromise. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope you'll consider this proposal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the product's value and gives us both some room for agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've thought about it, and I believe we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. I propose $1,425,000 as a compromise. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. I hope you'll consider this proposal.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,425,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price that's slightly closer to my desired value. How about we meet in the middle one last time at $1,437,500? This is a small increase, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.  Let's try to find a final solution that works for both of us.",1437500.0,Alice,7,
