This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price:** You've gotten Alice down to $10,500, which is a $1,500 savings from her original offer and John's price. 
* **Finality:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer and is considering other options. Holding out further risks her walking away from the deal. 

While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
