I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than I was hoping for, it's close enough to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. It's better to secure a good price now than risk getting a lower price in later rounds or selling to John for a lower amount."
