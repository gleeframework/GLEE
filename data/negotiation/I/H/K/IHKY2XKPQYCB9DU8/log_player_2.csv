"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be valuable to you.  I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my budget. It's much better to try to negotiate with Alice or move on to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $13,000 is a significant drop from my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget, but closer to what I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to negotiate further, but I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if the price doesn't come down further."
