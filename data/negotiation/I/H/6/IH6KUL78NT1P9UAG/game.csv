"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding a price point that works for you is important. To be candid,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I don't think I can go any higher. Can you think of a way to make this work for both of us?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's value.  What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
