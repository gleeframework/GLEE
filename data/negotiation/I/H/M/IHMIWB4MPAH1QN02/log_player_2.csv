"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is far too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to go down to $9,000. That's a significant price reduction from my initial offer and still allows you to get a good deal on a valuable product.  Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7,000 is tempting, it's still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This gives you a good deal, and it allows me to move this product without having to go with another buyer.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Alice has met your ideal price point. There's no need to go another round or buy from John, as you're getting the same price from Alice now."
