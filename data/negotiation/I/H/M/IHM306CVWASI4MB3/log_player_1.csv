Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $2,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I can afford to start negotiations significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and his perceived value of the product. His response will inform my next move. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While my initial offer is high, it leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value without revealing my guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If I have insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, agreeable), I can tailor my approach accordingly. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If I'm on a tight deadline, I might adjust my strategy to be more time-efficient."
