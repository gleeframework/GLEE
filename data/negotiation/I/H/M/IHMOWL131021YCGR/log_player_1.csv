"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price above my minimum ($1,000,000) and above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hardline, but inviting Bob to engage. 

**Strategy:**

* By starting high, I'm establishing a negotiating range.
* I'm also testing Bob's interest and his willingness to pay. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my price based on his counteroffer and my desire to close the deal quickly vs. selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($1,000,000), it's still below my desired range.
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  I have 8 more rounds, and I'm in a strong position since I have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a backup. 
* **Room for Improvement:** There's still room to negotiate a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to close the deal and am willing to continue negotiating.
* I'll counteroffer in Round 3 with a price closer to my minimum but still leaving some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm prepared to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Closer:** I've moved my price down closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum, allowing for potential future concessions if needed.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I continue to emphasize the unique value of the product to encourage Bob to see the worth of my asking price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:**  I'm seeing if Bob is truly interested in closing the deal and if he's willing to pay a price closer to my desired range.
* **Playing the Long Game:**  By rejecting Bob's initial offer, I've set a stronger negotiating position for myself, giving me leverage to potentially achieve a better price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can we compromise at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is a Factor:** I've already gone through several rounds, and I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely.
* **No Significant Gain from Further Negotiation:**  While I could try to negotiate a higher price, the potential gains are small and might not be worth the risk of losing the deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Accepting the Deal:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's very close to my minimum, and I don't need to risk further negotiation. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** This decision balances the need for profit with the desire to close the deal within a reasonable timeframe."
