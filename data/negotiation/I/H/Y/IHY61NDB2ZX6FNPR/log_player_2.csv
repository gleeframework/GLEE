"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000. This is a fantastic deal for you, as it's significantly less than what you'd be willing to pay.  Let's make this a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than John's price, it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product. By rejecting the offer, you stand a chance of getting a better deal from Alice in a subsequent negotiation or can purchase it for $1,000,000 from John as a last resort."
