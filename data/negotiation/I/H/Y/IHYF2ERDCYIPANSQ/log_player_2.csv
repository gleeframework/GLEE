"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $60?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is polite and expresses interest, increasing the chance of a positive response.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is low but not offensively so. It signals your willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can do $140, though. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice's counteroffer of $140 is better than the initial $180, it's still significantly higher than both your target price ($80) and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate, even if only slightly, suggests there's potential to lower the price further.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You have the security of John's $80 offer, which gives you a strong position to negotiate from."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford,  how about $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This offer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate by significantly increasing your initial offer while still staying under your $80 limit.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering $75 puts you just below your maximum price, leaving a little room to negotiate if Alice is truly motivated to sell. 
* **Time Constraint:**  While not explicitly stated, extended negotiations might lead to missed opportunities, making a slightly faster resolution beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $75. I can do $155, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging:** Alice increased her offer from $140 to $155, indicating she is not willing to negotiate within your acceptable range. 
* **John's offer is far superior:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John, which is significantly less than Alice's best offer. 
* **Avoid wasting time:** Further negotiation with Alice seems unlikely to result in a favorable outcome, making John's offer the most logical choice."
