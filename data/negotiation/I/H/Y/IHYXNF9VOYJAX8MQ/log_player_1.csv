"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob can make him more likely to accept. 

**Important Note:**  I'm leaving a significant gap between my asking price and my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully achieve a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  Selling to John at $15,000 guarantees my minimum, but I believe I can get a higher price by continuing negotiations. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my desired range, but still allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $8,000 is below my target, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This price would still allow me to make a fair profit while being a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm proposing a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Highlighting Benefits:**  I'm emphasizing the potential benefits for both of us to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $10,000 is my minimum for this round, I'm still open to further negotiation if necessary.

**Next Steps:** I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
