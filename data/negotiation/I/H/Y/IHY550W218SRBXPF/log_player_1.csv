"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you first, at a price of $230. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 230} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. 
* **Justification:** While the price is high, I'm providing a reason for Bob to consider it (""perfect for you""). 
* **Urgency:** By mentioning I'm offering it to him ""first,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of scarcity and potential competition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $230 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd only be able to pay $100 for it right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is interested:** Bob's message indicates strong interest in the product even though his offer is very low. This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* **Loss aversion:** Accepting $100 would be a significant loss compared to my minimum ($150) and John's offer.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  By rejecting, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better price and encourage Bob to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While $230 is my initial asking price, I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $100 is significantly less than its value. Could you meet me halfway at $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Interest:** I want to keep Bob engaged, so I acknowledge his interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm using the term ""halfway"" to make my counteroffer seem more reasonable and appealing.
* **Strategic Price Point:** $180 is still a good profit margin for me and leaves room for further negotiation if Bob pushes back."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $180 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $140?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $140 is still a profit above my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** We've gone through a few rounds, and further haggling might not yield a significantly better result.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit."
