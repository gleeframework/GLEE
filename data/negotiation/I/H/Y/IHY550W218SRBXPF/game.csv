,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $230 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd only be able to pay $100 for it right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While $230 is my initial asking price, I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $100 is significantly less than its value. Could you meet me halfway at $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $180 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $140?  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,
