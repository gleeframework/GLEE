"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it.",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $82.50. I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway earlier. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll give you a small discount and sell the product to you for $81.50. That's as low as I can go.",81.5,Alice,5,
