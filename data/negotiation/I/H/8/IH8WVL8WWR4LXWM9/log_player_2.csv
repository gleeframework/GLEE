"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  You can potentially get the product for much cheaper than $65.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to explore a lower price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Reasoning:**  Since your maximum budget is $120, I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially set the stage for a more favorable price in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $55 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows for further exploration of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, decreasing her price by $10. I'm raising my offer slightly to show good faith but staying below her price to push for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $57.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $57.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has moved her price up slightly, but it's still within a reasonable range.  Rejecting and counter-offering again can potentially get the price down closer to $50.  It's worth exploring a bit more before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 52.5}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but she is also trying to push the price up.  My counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer and my last offer, hoping to find a compromise.  This strategy helps maintain the momentum of negotiation and hopefully get closer to a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $56.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $56.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $56.25 is still within my budget and is only slightly higher than my last counter-offer.  With only a few rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly lower price.  Accepting this offer guarantees a purchase and saves me from needing to buy from John at a higher price.  Additionally, continuing to negotiate could risk a stalemate or Alice walking away from the deal entirely."
