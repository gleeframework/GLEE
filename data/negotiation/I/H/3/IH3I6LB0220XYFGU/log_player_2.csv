{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth exploring options before committing.  $600,000 is a good price, but there's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower. Let's see what counteroffer we can get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
``` 

Let's start with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is truly motivated to sell.  $400,000 is a significant drop from her initial price, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can get closer to my target price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

Let's split the difference and see if we can get a deal done. $450,000 is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about buying but still allows for some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still coming down, but not as much as I'd like.  I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can push for a lower price.  We have some rounds left and there's no need to rush into a deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

Let's try meeting her halfway again. $500,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful she'll accept it."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice seems to be stuck at $600,000. I'm not going to accept that price yet.  We have some rounds left, and there's still a chance I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to split the difference. $550,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will see that it's a fair price for both of us. If she rejects, I'll have to start considering John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer has gone up, indicating she's unwilling to budge further.  It's clear we're not going to reach a deal that's significantly lower than $650,000. Since I only have one round left, it's better to go with John's offer at $1,200,000. This ensures I get the product and doesn't leave me scrambling in the final round."
