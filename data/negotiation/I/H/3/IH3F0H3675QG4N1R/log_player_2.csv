"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value to me and I believe it would be equally valuable to you given its worth of $10,000 to you. After careful consideration, I am offering this exceptional product to you for $9,500. This price reflects the quality and the high demand for this item in the market. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, knowing your maximum is $10,000. While $9,500 isn't terrible, it's worth seeing if she'll come down further.  You can always accept her offer later if needed."
