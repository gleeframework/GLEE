"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $14000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to pay $13000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I am pleased to counteroffer at $13500 for the product. This price still represents a significant discount compared to its value, while also reflecting the current market conditions and your interest in the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
