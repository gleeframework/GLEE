Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is above Bob's perceived value ($10,000), but it's worth a try.  He might be willing to pay a premium depending on the product's importance to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $19,000, you signal that you're open to discussion while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below your safety net of $15,000."
