Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 180} 
 
This starting point aims high but leaves room for negotiation. It's crucial to project confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it matches the minimum I'm willing to accept. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same price, it makes more sense to sell to John directly. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower final price."
