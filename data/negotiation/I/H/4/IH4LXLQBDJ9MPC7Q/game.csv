"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside of my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000.  I truly believe this price reflects the value of the product to me. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $900,000. This is already a very good deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers, so I'll offer it to you for $875,000. This is my final compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. However, $875,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm firm on my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a significant compromise from my original offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and make it work.",825000.0,Bob,6,
