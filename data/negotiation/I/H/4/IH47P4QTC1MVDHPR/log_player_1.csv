"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, leaving room for negotiation but still securing a profit for me. I'm aiming to maximize my earnings while also being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is high to you, but I can only pay up to $13,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also aware that selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and am willing to increase my offer to $13,200. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $13,200 is still below my minimum value. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, as there's potential to reach a better deal. However, I'm also keeping in mind that selling to John for $12,000 is a secure option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, I can't go any lower than $13,400. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me halfway, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 13400} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your position and am willing to pay $13,300 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,300 is very close to my minimum value of $12,000.  It's also a more secure option than selling to John and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
