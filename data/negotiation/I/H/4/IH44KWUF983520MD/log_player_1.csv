"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($150) but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  This offer gives Bob a clear incentive to negotiate while ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120).
* **Building Rapport:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes Bob's potential benefit, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is to maximize profit. While $130 is higher than my minimum, it's still below the starting offer of $140.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate to sell at his price and maintains negotiation leverage. 
* **Potential for Improvement:**  There's room for further negotiation, potentially securing a price closer to my initial offer.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup option provides safety net in case negotiations fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes a desire to reach an agreement and focuses on a positive outcome.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** $135 is a price that's still above my minimum and closer to my initial offer, allowing for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving without giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $132? I'm trying to be fair, but I also need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $132 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $135.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but there's a risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation dragging on. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With 6 rounds remaining, accepting this offer secures a good price quickly.
* **John as Safety Net:**  If things go south, I can still sell to John for $120."
