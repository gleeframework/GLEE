"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $12,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is within your budget, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of the product. You can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's in the middle of our perceived values. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.  It's a good starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a little too low for me. How about $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it still leaves you with a great deal. Let's try to find some common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to my ideal price, it's still above my preferred range. I want to see if I can push Alice down further.  There are still rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get the best price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,250.  I'm eager to get this deal done, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

By offering $13,250, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still staying within my budget. This price is closer to Alice's offer, indicating a willingness to compromise.  The message reinforces my eagerness to close the deal, which might make Alice more inclined to accept."
