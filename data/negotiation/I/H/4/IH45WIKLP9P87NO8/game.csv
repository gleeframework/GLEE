"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $12,000 to me. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a little too low for me. How about $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it still leaves you with a great deal. Let's try to find some common ground here.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get the best price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,250.  I'm eager to get this deal done, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",13250.0,Bob,4,
