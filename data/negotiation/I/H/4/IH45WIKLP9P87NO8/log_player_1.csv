Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $12,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  $13,000 is a good deal, but I can still do better.  I'll counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a little too low for me. How about $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it still leaves you with a great deal. Let's try to find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get the best price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,250.  I'm eager to get this deal done, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, I'm happy to accept Bob's offer.  It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too greedy.  I'd rather get $13,250 now than potentially end up with $12,000 from John."
