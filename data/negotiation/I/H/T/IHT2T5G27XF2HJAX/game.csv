"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider it?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate the compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12,800. Can you consider it?",12800.0,Bob,4,
