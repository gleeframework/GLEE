,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I value your enthusiasm, $90 is a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $110? It's a fair price that still allows for a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 just isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great price for such a fantastic product, and it's still within a reasonable range for both of us.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $98. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",98.0,Bob,6,
