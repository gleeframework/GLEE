"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  My asking price is $120, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and above what I know the product is worth to Bob ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and creates a good starting point. 
* **Showing flexibility:** I've indicated I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Opportunity to counter:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a higher price. 
* **John is a fallback option:**  Knowing I have John as a buyer for $100 provides security and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I value your enthusiasm, $90 is a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $110? It's a fair price that still allows for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable increase:**  I'm increasing the price by $10, which is a significant but not unreasonable jump. It shows I'm willing to compromise but also value the product.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize that the price is ""fair"" and benefits both of us, making it less likely for Bob to feel like he's being taken advantage of.
* **Maintaining negotiation:**  By staying open to further negotiation, I encourage Bob to potentially come up on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Even though Bob has come up on his offer, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John is a safe option:** I'm confident I can sell to John for $100, which is a better deal than accepting Bob's current offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter again, hopefully reaching a price closer to my minimum or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 just isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great price for such a fantastic product, and it's still within a reasonable range for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $105, which is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm serious about a deal but not desperate.
* **Positive framing:** I continue to frame the offer as beneficial for both parties, highlighting the quality of the product and the ""great price"" it offers.
* **Pressuring Bob:**  I'm indicating that this may be my final offer, putting a bit of pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $98. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his final offer of $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100, which is a higher price than Bob's final offer.
* **Limited time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't have much time to continue negotiating with Bob.  Selling to John ensures I get a good price and eliminates the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob."
