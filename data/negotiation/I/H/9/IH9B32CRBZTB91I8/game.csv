"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still asking for $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'd be willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $15,500. This is a final offer, and if you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but $15,500 is still a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $14,750 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",14750.0,Bob,6,
