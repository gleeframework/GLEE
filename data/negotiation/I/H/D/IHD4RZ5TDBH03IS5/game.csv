"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit high for my budget right now.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of the product's value. While I'm aware of your budget constraints, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This price still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being more flexible within your current budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
