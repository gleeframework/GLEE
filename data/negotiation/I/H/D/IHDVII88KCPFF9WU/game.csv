"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see the value, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is already a competitive price considering the value this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,075,000?  This would be a fair price considering the value you're getting for the product.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
