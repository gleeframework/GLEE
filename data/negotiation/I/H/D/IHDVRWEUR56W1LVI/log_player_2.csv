"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the initial offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is still fair considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is closer to Bob's preferred price, but it's still a bit too high. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy."
