"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is still fair considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a significant return on your investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",875000.0,Bob,4,
