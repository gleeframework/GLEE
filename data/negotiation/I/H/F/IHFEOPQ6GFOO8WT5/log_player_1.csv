{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to the right person. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. I believe the product holds more value and I'm willing to negotiate further.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I believe this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the unique value this product offers, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product is worth a lot, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal. It's much closer to my minimum value and I'm confident I can't get a better price within the remaining rounds."
