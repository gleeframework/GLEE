"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it could be very valuable for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $925,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $875,000 is an improvement, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but only to $900,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this is the best compromise for both of us, considering the value it will bring to my business.",875000.0,Bob,6,
