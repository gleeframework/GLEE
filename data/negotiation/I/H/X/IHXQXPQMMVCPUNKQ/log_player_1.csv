"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than the product's value to him, but it's still a decent offer. Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob a price of $9,000. This is higher than his offer, but still lower than the original price I was looking for.
