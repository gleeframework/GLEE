"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price. You can potentially save more money by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant drop from Alice's offer of $9,500, but it's still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I can get her to come down further. John is offering a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is my target price. It's more efficient and less risky to simply buy from John."
