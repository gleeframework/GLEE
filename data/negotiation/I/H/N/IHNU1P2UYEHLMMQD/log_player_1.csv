Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him some room to negotiate. This approach balances maximizing my profit with the possibility of reaching an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for $8,000, so I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I would prefer to sell for more, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a failed deal is too high.  It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
