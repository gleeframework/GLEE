Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $120. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping to get a deal quickly. If he rejects, I'll have to consider John's offer, which is guaranteed to give me my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $115. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
