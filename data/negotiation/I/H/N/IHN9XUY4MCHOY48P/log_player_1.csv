Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, hoping to increase his willingness to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've made a good deal and can close the sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his offer.  I'll be prepared to make further counteroffers or walk away if necessary.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than his perceived value of $800,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. I need to be more aggressive in my counteroffer. 

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $800,000. 
* **John as a safety net:** I will keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and offers you a significant benefit.  I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a compromise at Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll gain from owning it. 
* **Positive framing:**  I use positive language like ""worthwhile investment"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a good price and can close the deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his new proposal. 
* **John as a backup:**  I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
