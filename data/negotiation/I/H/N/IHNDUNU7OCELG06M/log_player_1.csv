"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have the option to sell to John for that price, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at a loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to get Bob to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still reflects the value this product brings.  Let's bridge the gap and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to increase his offer, $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm still in a position to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not going to settle for a loss just yet.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to push Bob closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too far from what this product is worth. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the value I place on the product. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some progress, $1,250,000 is still not close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale to John, giving me a solid fallback position.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired range, hoping to push Bob further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about the price, but $1,250,000 is still too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000, which reflects a substantial compromise on my part. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm appreciative of your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value I place on your product.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm running out of time to negotiate, and it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.  To avoid risking a deal falling through entirely, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,500,000. This ensures I achieve my minimum price and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
