"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given its value to you, I'd like to propose a price of $1100000.  This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. ",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1100000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1300000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably commit to.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1150000?  This reflects a significant move from my initial offer, and I'm sure you'll find it a fair price considering your own valuation.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
