"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go above $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're coming down in price, which I appreciate. However, $1,300,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's try to meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but the gap between our positions is still significant.  I'm lowering my price to $1,150,000. I believe this offer balances the inherent value of the product with a desire to find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. I think this shows my genuine interest in the product, and it's a fair offer considering your previous concessions.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
