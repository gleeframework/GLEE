"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm not willing to go too far below this price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet your initial price. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try $850,000? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my last offer. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. How about we try $825,000? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see we both want to make this deal happen. To show I'm serious, I'm willing to offer $780,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while still working within my budget.",780000.0,Bob,6,
