"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a middle ground. Let's try $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and keeps us within a reasonable range. Let's keep this momentum going and close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $875,000 still doesn't meet my minimum requirements.  Let's try $890,000. This is a fair compromise, and it keeps us both within a reasonable range. Let's work towards a successful conclusion to this negotiation.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $890,000 is still just a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go to $880,000.  This is a fair compromise that respects both our needs. Let's find a solution that makes us both happy.",880000.0,Bob,6,
