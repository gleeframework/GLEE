# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiations.  While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, I only have 3 rounds left.  It's unlikely that she'll come down to my desired $11,000.  To guarantee I get the product at a price I can afford, I'm going to purchase it from John for $10,000.  It's better to get the product at my target price than to risk not getting it at all."
