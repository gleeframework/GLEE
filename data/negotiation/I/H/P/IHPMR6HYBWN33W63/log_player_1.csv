"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm looking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value but significantly below my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I believe I can offer $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? "", ""product_price"": 102.50}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's offer, but still below my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground and encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering my budget, I'd like to propose $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like a higher price, $100 is very close to my minimum value, and it's likely Bob won't budge further. Accepting his offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
