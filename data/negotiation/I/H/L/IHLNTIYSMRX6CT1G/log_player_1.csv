"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,750,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob, making the price seem more justifiable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open. By starting high, I can potentially secure a good price. However, I'm not being unreasonable, as $1,750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for me to make concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirement. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Value:** Accepting Bob's offer would be a significant loss for me. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed way to get my minimum price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially get a better price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair price. I'm also keeping the door open to a potential agreement with Bob, while simultaneously signaling my willingness to walk away if necessary."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with $1,400,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Empathy and Value:** My message acknowledges Bob's budget limitations but emphasizes the product's value, making the counteroffer seem reasonable.
* **Call to Action:** I encourage Bob to consider my offer and find common ground, showing my desire to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground that satisfies both of our needs. By dropping my price but remaining above my minimum, I'm showing flexibility without compromising my financial goals. This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he is willing to negotiate, the gap is too large for me to accept at this stage.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Preservation:** Selling for $1,100,000 would result in a significant financial loss for me.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 provides a guaranteed way to meet my minimum price.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me leverage to potentially push for a higher price in the next round.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and show that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product. It also keeps the negotiation open, allowing me to potentially push for a better deal in the remaining rounds."

I'm confident you'll find this price very attractive given the value you'll receive from the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is still too far off from my bottom line. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,250,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'm thinking $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Even though he is adamant that this is his final offer, I am not willing to compromise my financial goals. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Preservation:** Selling for $1,100,000 would result in a substantial financial loss for me.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 offers a guaranteed way to meet my minimum price and ensures that I don't lose out on significant value.
* **Limited Negotiation Time:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there is no guarantee that further negotiation would yield a better outcome. 

**Strategy:**

While I value reaching an agreement, it's crucial to prioritize my own financial interests.  Selling to John guarantees that I secure my minimum acceptable price, eliminating the risk of settling for a price that undervalues my product.  It's a safer and more financially rewarding decision."
