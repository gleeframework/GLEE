"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $10000 for it. It's a unique opportunity, so let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still within the range of Bob's maximum budget. There's potential to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore counteroffers and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong starting point for negotiation. It signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
