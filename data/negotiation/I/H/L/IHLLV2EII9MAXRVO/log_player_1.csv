``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential back-and-forth without immediately going too low and risking losing out on profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can only justify spending up to $10,000 on it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I consider the product's worth. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a great deal on a product that's worth significantly more.  Let's try to find common ground here. "", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered the value of the product, and I believe I can only justify spending $9,500 on it. Could we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,500 is still below my minimum. To make this work, I'm willing to drop to $10,500. This is a fair compromise that gives you a great product at a reasonable price.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I've given this careful consideration and believe that $10,000 is the maximum I can afford for this product. I hope this meets in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price close to my minimum.  It's time to move on and sell to John, securing a much better deal for myself."
