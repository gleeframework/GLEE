"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's below your $100 limit, but you can likely get a better price.
* **You have time on your side.**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate and the option to buy from John for $100. 
* **Counteroffers are key.**  By rejecting the initial offer, you start the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  A $60 counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate. It's also a price that's still reasonable considering the product's value to you.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By not going too low, you leave room for Alice to counter with a price that's still profitable for her while being more favorable to you.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  $60 is still within your acceptable range, but it's closer to your $100 limit, ensuring you're still getting a good deal compared to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.** It's a compromise from her previous offer and gets closer to my desired price.
* **Time is a factor.**  While I could continue negotiating, I'm already at round 3, and each round brings me closer to my limit with John. 
* **A good deal, but not the best.**  While I'd prefer a lower price, $80 is still a good deal compared to John's $100, and I'm likely not going to get a much lower price from Alice."
