"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully maximizes my profit.  I'm aware this is a risky strategy, but I'm confident in the value of my product and believe there's a good chance Bob will be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to try and negotiate a higher price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price considering his low counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to earn more, I don't want to risk losing this deal and being forced to sell to John at the same price.  It's better to secure the deal and move on."
