"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I'm extending this exclusive offer for you to purchase it for $120. This is a special deal tailored just for you, and I hope you'll find it irresistible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than John's price.  It makes sense to negotiate and see if we can get a better deal from Alice before defaulting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about considering the product for $95? This still allows you to enjoy its benefits without straining your finances too much. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While closer to our ideal price, Alice's offer is still above John's. We have room to negotiate further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $95 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Could you do $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try $90. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. I hope you find this price attractive and decide to take advantage of this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:** $90 is a significant savings compared to her initial offer and a reasonable compromise. 
* **""Final offer"" signal:** Alice is signaling this is her best price.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If we push further and she's serious about other buyers, we might miss out and have to settle for John's $100 price."
