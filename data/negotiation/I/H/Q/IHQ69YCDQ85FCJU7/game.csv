"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. Would you consider $950000 for the product? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and meets your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
