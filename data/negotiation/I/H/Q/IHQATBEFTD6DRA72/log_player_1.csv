Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob is worthwhile. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" are used to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid losing out on a deal he perceives as valuable."
