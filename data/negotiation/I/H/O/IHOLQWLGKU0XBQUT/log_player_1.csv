{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you [Product Name] at a price of $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a fantastic deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant premium over your minimum price, making it attractive to Bob. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. Remember, this is just the beginning of the negotiation. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, you can likely do better. You've established a higher starting point, and you know he's interested. It's worth trying to push for a better price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $900,000 is the lowest I can go at this time. This is a fair price for the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're not willing to go lower than $900000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to your minimum, and you've already made a counteroffer. It's unlikely you'll be able to push for a significantly higher price, and there's always the risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
