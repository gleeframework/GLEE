"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire for a good deal, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value to me. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $850000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,4,

This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $825000. I'd like to make a final offer of $775000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",775000.0,Bob,6,
