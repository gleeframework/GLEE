"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700000 is simply too low.  This product is worth considerably more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a fair compromise. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to go down to $850000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's finalize this now.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that $800000 is a fair price for both of us. It's my final offer, and I hope you'll accept it.  This will allow us to both walk away satisfied.",800000.0,Bob,6,
