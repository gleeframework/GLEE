{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, and you're offering it for $100,000 less. This creates an incentive for him to consider the offer.
* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling below your minimum of $1,000,000, so you're still getting a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still adjust the price higher without losing too much ground.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit. By starting with a reasonable offer, you can encourage Bob to negotiate and potentially arrive at a price that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and what you believe the product is worth. While it's tempting to take the quick sale, it's better to try and negotiate further or explore selling to John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain your value:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that you're serious about the product's worth and not desperate for a sale.
* **Continue negotiations:**  You can counteroffer with a price closer to your ideal value, potentially reaching a compromise.
* **Assess John's offer:** You can still explore selling to John if you don't find a satisfactory price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still offers you a good deal. It's a compromise that allows us both to benefit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer is a strategic move for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  You've moved down from your initial offer but are still above Bob's. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining value.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still come down a little further without sacrificing too much.
* **It signals your seriousness:**  By countering, you show Bob that you're not simply going to accept his lowball offer. 

Keep in mind that you always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000. By countering with $1,050,000, you're still getting a better price than John's offer while giving Bob a chance to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still not a good deal for you. You can still do better by: 

* **Maintaining your position:** Rejecting the offer shows Bob that you're not settling for a price below your desired value.
* **Counteroffering again:** You can counter with a price closer to your ideal value, pushing for a better deal.
* **Considering John's offer:** If you can't get a satisfactory price from Bob, you always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000.

By continuing to negotiate, you have the potential to maximize your profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - $1,012,500. It's a fair price that's closer to your offer but still reflects the value of the product. This is my final offer, so let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1012500} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Signal finality:**  The message emphasizes that this is your final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or reject.
* **Remain close to your minimum:** You're only slightly below your minimum acceptable price, demonstrating your commitment to value.
* **Meet in the middle:**  You've offered a compromise by splitting the difference between your last offer and Bob's.

By presenting this counteroffer, you're showing Bob that you're serious about getting a good price, but you're also willing to be flexible. It gives Bob a chance to accept and close the deal, or to walk away. Ultimately, the choice is in his hands."
