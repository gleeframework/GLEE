I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also incentivizes Bob to accept quickly, as he knows I can easily sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $975,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. I believe this is a fair price that will incentivize Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too close to my minimum value, and I'm worried that further negotiation will only lead to more back and forth without any real progress.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get the maximum value for my product."
