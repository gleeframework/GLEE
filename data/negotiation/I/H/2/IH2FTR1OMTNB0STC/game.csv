"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9500. How about we split the difference and settle on $10250? It's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $10250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into acquiring it.",11500.0,Alice,5,
