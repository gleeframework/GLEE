"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $12,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's more than your valuation. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000, as it's still below my minimum valuation. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant compromise for me. I believe this is a fair price, considering you are willing to sell below your valuation. Let's meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer. However, $14,000 is still a bit below my minimum valuation. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $15,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000 and I'm willing to sell below my valuation.
