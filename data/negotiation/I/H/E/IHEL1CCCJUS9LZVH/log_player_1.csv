"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you'd ideally like to receive. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down in price. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** The offer is slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to make it immediately attractive while still aiming for a significant profit for Alice.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed in a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good one, it's still significantly below Alice's aspiration and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. Alice has room to negotiate and should try to guide the price closer to her target. Selling to John at this point would be a last resort, as it means missing out on a potentially much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market conditions. However, the value this product brings, especially to someone like you, is truly unique.  I could consider coming down to $1,120,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Alice is coming down from her initial offer, signaling her willingness to negotiate.
* **Justify the Price:**  The message emphasizes the product's unique value, subtly reminding Bob why it's worth more than his initial offer.
* **Strategic Concession:** The counteroffer is a significant drop, but it still keeps the price well above Alice's minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,080,000 is the maximum I can go. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is steadily increasing his offers. However, $1,080,000 is still a significant margin below Alice's target. She has the leverage to push for more, especially since they still have several rounds of negotiation left. 

While selling to John is an option, accepting Bob's current offer or even countering with a minor decrease would be premature. Alice should hold firm for now and see if Bob is willing to move closer to her desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. It shows you're serious about this, and I respect that. I've considered your latest offer carefully. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your willingness to compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** Alice is signaling that she's aiming for a fair deal by splitting the difference between their previous offers.
* **Firm but Fair:**  While she's coming down slightly, the message is phrased to convey that this is a significant concession and likely close to her final position.
* **Time Pressure:**  As rounds progress, there's a subtle increase in time pressure, which could nudge Bob towards acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding of my position, Alice. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position, But Diminishing Returns:** While Alice could likely push for a bit more, Bob is signaling that $1,080,000 is his absolute limit. Further negotiation might risk the deal altogether. 
* **Profitable Outcome:** Accepting this offer still gives Alice a significant profit of $80,000 above her minimum. 
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of losing the deal entirely, either by Bob walking away or by missing a potential opportunity with another buyer.  Closing the deal now secures a good profit."
