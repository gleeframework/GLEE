You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$800,000 is a good starting point, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 25% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows my serious intent to negotiate while also leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to keep pushing for a lower price, as I'm confident I can get it for less than $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still believe I can get a better deal. This is a more moderate counteroffer that might be more appealing to Alice, while still keeping my goal of saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $720,000 is getting close to my ideal price range. While I would prefer a lower price, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might lead to Alice becoming less willing to compromise.  Given the limited rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a decent price while leaving time for potential future negotiations if needed."
