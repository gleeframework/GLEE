"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to encourage him to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** The $140 price gives us both some room to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm starting the conversation with a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still below my minimum of $150. 
* **Opportunity to increase the price:** I can potentially increase the price by making a counteroffer, even if it means going back and forth a few more rounds.
* **Not risking losing out:**  I'm not in a rush to sell, so I can afford to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $130 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground by increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reinforcing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Show flexibility:** By meeting halfway, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to be flexible and find a solution."
