"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $18,000 is unfortunately a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $14,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe you'll find it a great investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is a fair price given my limit and still allows you to make a profit.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for you.",16250.0,Alice,5,
