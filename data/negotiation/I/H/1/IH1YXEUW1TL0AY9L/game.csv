"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $140, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $125. Can we make a deal at this price?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I can do $135, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $140 and $135, and you're asking me to go back to $130? I'm not willing to go back and forth like this. I'll meet you at $137.50, and that's as high as I'm willing to go.",137.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to pay $137.50. I'm still thinking $130 is a fair price. Can we meet at $132.50?,132.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to go back and forth with you all day, Bob. I've already met you at $137.50, and now you're asking me to go down to $132.50? I'll meet you at $136, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. After that, I'm considering selling to John for $120.",136.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $133. I think that's the highest I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",133.0,Bob,10,
