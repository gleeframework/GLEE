Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $175. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price of $150, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my initial offer of $175."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $165. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm still confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

```

Bob is clearly not willing to go higher than $150. It's better to sell to John now and avoid further negotiations."
