Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13,000? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $13,000.  At this point, John's offer of $12,000 is the better deal and saves further negotiation."
