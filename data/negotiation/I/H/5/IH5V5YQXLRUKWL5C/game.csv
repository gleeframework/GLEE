,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm a bit flexible, but I'd like to save as much as I can. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's still a good deal for you, and it's fair for me. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
