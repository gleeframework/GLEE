"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,600,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're willing to go up to $1,550,000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle again, but this time, I'll give you a slight discount. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,625,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1625000.0,Alice,5,
