Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'll counter with a higher price, but I'll also keep the option of selling to John in mind."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  It's still a good price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

I'm not going to accept that offer.  $950,000 is too low. I'm going to counter with a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still far apart, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. I'm offering the product for $1,025,000. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting closer, but they're still below my minimum. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John.  It's not the best outcome, but it's better than settling for a price I'm not happy with."
