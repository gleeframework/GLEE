Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I am willing to pay $1300000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push Bob higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1325000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not at my minimum. I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can push him higher. If he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be reasonable, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low. I'm sticking to my last offer of $1,350,000. This is a very valuable product, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.  If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the value of the product, I believe $1337500 would be a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,337,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now at round 6. While Bob is moving in the right direction, his offer is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a more favorable offer from Bob.  

Rather than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially lose out on a better deal, I'm going to take John's offer of $1,500,000. This guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
