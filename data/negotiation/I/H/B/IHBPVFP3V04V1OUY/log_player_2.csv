"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's valued at $800000 to you, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable. My initial offer is $1000000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me at this moment. I am really interested in this product but my maximum budget is $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly below my minimum price, I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $900000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. You should reject the offer and continue negotiating to see if you can reach a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and represents my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need a bit more to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get her to come down further.  Since you only have a few rounds left, you'll have to decide soon whether to buy from John or continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering our previous negotiations, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However,  $875000 is still significantly below my minimum asking price.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering the product for $925000. This is a fair price given the value it holds for you.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still higher than your budget. With only three rounds left, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a price you're comfortable with.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000. You'll save $75,000 compared to Alice's current offer, and it's a more secure option with limited rounds remaining."
