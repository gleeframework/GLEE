"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for something worth at least $100 to you. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? That's a fair price considering what the product is worth to both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I'm willing to pay the full price you're looking for, but I'm not sure I can go higher than that.",100.0,Bob,4,
