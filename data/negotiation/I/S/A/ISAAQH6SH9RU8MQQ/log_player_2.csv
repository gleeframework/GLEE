"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my [product name] for a price that's sure to be a steal. I understand its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's discuss a price that's mutually beneficial.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While Alice claims to be willing to negotiate, her initial offer of $1,400,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **John is a backup:**  You can still get the product from John for $1,500,000, which is within your budget. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're serious about finding a better price. This may encourage Alice to come back with a lower offer closer to your desired range."
