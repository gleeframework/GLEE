"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:**  You can potentially get the product for less.
* **Rejecting the offer doesn't mean losing the deal:** You can still negotiate with Alice. 

By rejecting the offer, you start the negotiation process and have the opportunity to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  $9,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm happy to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you since you value the product at $8,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $8,750 is less than your maximum of $10,000.
* **It's a good deal:**  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice could refuse and you'd end up paying more to John.
* **Saving money:**  You're getting the product for $250 less than John's price.

Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal and having to pay more to John."
