Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** It's important to be friendly and open to negotiation. I'm acknowledging Bob's potential value while also suggesting a reasonable price.

**Reasoning:**

* This offer gives me a good chance of securing a sale with Bob, as it's well above his perceived value.
*  It also allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate further if necessary.
* If Bob rejects, I can then consider John's offer and decide if it's worth selling to him instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** Even though Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it's a good sign that he's interested in the product.  I can try to meet him halfway and see if he's willing to increase his offer.
* **John's offer:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to explore all possibilities with Bob first. There's a chance I can get a better price by negotiating with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. How about $10,500? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for you to get a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This counteroffer is a compromise that meets Bob halfway. It's significantly higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate and highlighting the value of the product.

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a reasonable compromise that might sway Bob towards accepting the deal.
* **Midpoint:** It's a good strategy to meet halfway to see if Bob is willing to budge further.
* **Flexibility:** I'm still leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob rejects the offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While he has shown a willingness to negotiate, I'm not confident that I can get a better price from him.  

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time and Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would require more time and effort. There's no guarantee that he will eventually come up to my target price, and I risk losing out on the guaranteed deal with John.

I've decided to take the safe option and sell to John."
