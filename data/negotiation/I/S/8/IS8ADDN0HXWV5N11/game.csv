"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,750? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $8,900. I'm willing to go up to $8,700, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",8700.0,Bob,6,
