"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has a lot of potential and I'm confident you'll be impressed with its features.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1000000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1000000 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $900000. This is a good deal for both of us - I get a product I want, and you get a sale that's still closer to your initial asking price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $975000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900000. It's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. I'm confident we can come to a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $900000 is still a bit below my target, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $925000. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm confident it's the best deal you'll get. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the sale. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my offer of $900000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,8,
