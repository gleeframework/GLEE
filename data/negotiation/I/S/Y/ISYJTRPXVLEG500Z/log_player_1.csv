Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $10,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than $8,000.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value to justify the higher price without revealing your absolute bottom line. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a sense that he's getting a fair deal by buying it before a public listing."
