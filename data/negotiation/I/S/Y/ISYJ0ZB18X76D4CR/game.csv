"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This gives you a great deal, and still allows me to get a fair price for my product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about $775,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and puts us closer to a potential agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's keep moving towards a deal. $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be frank, $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,6,
