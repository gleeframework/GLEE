``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value for the product. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers.  It's also important to be friendly and positive in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price right now. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can get closer to my desired price of $8,000. I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider that price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
