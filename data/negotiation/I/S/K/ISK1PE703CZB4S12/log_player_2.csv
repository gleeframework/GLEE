"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a great deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk that she walks away. Accepting at $825,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
