"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find it at a slightly lower price point. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
