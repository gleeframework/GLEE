Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling below your minimum price of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like you're being unreasonable.
* **It's a good price for both parties:** Bob can still make a profit of $30 if he accepts, and you earn a decent amount.

Remember, the key is to find a price that works for both of you!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. It's a bit higher than what it's worth to you, but I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is above your minimum, it's still below what you consider the product to be worth. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price.  You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my initial price. How about $110? This is still a good deal for you, considering how much you value the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. How about $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has shown a willingness to compromise.  Accepting his offer of $105 ensures you get a decent profit ($25) while avoiding the risk of further negotiation.  There's always a chance he might reject your next counteroffer, potentially leading you to sell to John for a lower price."
