"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $10,500. It's a fair middle ground, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit above what I can afford. I'm hoping we can find a price closer to $9,000. Maybe we can meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $10,200. It's still a good compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $10,200 is still above my budget. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go up to $9,700.  That's a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can finally close this deal.",9700.0,Bob,6,
