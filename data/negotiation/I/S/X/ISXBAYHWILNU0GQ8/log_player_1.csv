"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but lower than my minimum of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Mutual benefit:** I frame the offer as a ""great deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's desire for a good bargain. 

This strategy aims to:

* Gauge Bob's initial interest and willingness to negotiate.
* Potentially get a quick deal if Bob is eager to buy. 
* Set the stage for further negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit.  Selling to John for $12,000 is still the best outcome. 
* **Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not desperate.  I'll try to push him further.
* **Risk:**  While rejecting his offer could lead to a stalemate, I have 8 more rounds and can always sell to John as a backup. 

By rejecting, I signal that I'm not willing to accept a lowball offer and can potentially leverage John's offer to push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by dropping my price slightly from $10,000.
* **Strategic counter:**  $9,500 is still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum. It gives me some leverage while still being reasonable.
* **Open to negotiation:** I use language like ""find a middle ground"" to keep the door open for further discussion. 

This counter aims to:

*  Indicate a willingness to negotiate without giving away too much.
*  Encourage Bob to meet me halfway. 
*  Keep the negotiation moving toward a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $9,200 is close to my minimum of $12,000, I still have 6 rounds left and can leverage John's offer to potentially get a better price.
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:**  Accepting Bob's offer now would mean leaving $2,800 on the table. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** By rejecting, I can continue to negotiate and hopefully secure a deal closer to my desired price. 

This rejection allows me to maintain pressure on Bob and potentially extract a higher price without risking selling to John prematurely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  While I value your continued interest, $9,200 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,350. This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession by dropping my price to $9,350, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  I reiterate the idea of a ""great deal"" for both of us, aiming to appeal to Bob's rationality and desire to find common ground.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's last offer, keeping some leverage while showing a willingness to negotiate.

This counter aims to:

*  Keep the negotiation moving forward without giving away too much.
*  Entice Bob to consider my offer as a fair compromise. 
*  Increase the chances of a successful deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $9,350 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,250. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for improvement:** While $9,250 is getting close to my minimum, I still have 4 rounds left and could potentially reach a better agreement.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  I can use John's offer of $12,000 as leverage in the remaining rounds, emphasizing that I have a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired value.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and hopefully secure a deal closer to $9,350 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. I'm willing to come down to $9,300. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another buyer. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm setting a clear deadline by stating this is my ""final offer.""  This adds pressure and urgency to the situation.
* **Slight Concession:**  While I'm coming down to $9,300, I'm still within a reasonable range of my previous offer. This shows I'm being flexible but not giving in completely.
* **Leveraging John:**  The mention of ""another buyer"" subtly reminds Bob that I have alternative options, making him more likely to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

This counter aims to:

*  Put pressure on Bob to make a decision.
*  Maximize my chances of closing the deal at a price closer to my desired value.
*  Prepare me to sell to John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're considering another buyer, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from John for $8,000. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're in Round 8, leaving only two rounds for negotiation. This is a crucial point.
* **Potential Stalemate:**  Both Bob and I have stated our offers as final.  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate and a missed opportunity.
* **John's Offer:** John is offering my minimum price, ensuring a guaranteed profit. 

**Decision:**

Selling to John now guarantees the best possible outcome.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of a stalemate is high, and I don't want to lose the opportunity to secure my minimum profit."
