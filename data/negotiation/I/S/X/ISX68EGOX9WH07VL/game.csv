"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $75 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's make this deal!",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $75 was a bit too low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's finalize this transaction!",80.0,Alice,5,
