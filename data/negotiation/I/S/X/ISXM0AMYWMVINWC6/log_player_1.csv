Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $150.  I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Since the product is worth $120 to both of you, aiming higher allows for a potential $30 profit instead of breaking even.
* **Backup Buyer:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you still get a fair price."
