"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's meet in the middle, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 as a final compromise. This is a really valuable product, and I'm sure you'll get your money's worth. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10,250, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,6,
