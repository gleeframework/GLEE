"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $950,000 is a good deal for him, considering his maximum budget is $1,200,000 and he can get the product for $250,000 less than that. While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ultimately ending up buying from John at a higher price is too high."
