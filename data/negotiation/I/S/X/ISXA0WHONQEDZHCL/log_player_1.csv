Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers excellent value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting Bob to buy it for slightly less still yields a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $14,000 is a strong offer. It's a substantial amount above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct and to the point, highlighting the offer and suggesting value.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
