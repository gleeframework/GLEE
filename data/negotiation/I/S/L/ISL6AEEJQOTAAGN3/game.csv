"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing the value we both place on this product. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This offer reflects the significant value this product will bring to your operations.",980000.0,Alice,5,
