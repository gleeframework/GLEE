I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get a better deal. I still have time and rounds left, and I'm not desperate enough to sell to John for only $8,000 yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair compromise given the value of this product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer again and counteroffer in the next round. There's still a chance we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $9,200 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $9,400. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both something to gain. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9400}
