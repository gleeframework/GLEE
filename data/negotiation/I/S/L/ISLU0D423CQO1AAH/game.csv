"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair compromise given the value of this product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,200.",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $9,200 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $9,400. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both something to gain. What do you say?",9400.0,Alice,5,
