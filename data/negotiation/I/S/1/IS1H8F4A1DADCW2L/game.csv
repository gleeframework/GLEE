"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counterproposal. While $1,200,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm confident that its unique qualities will bring you substantial returns in the long run.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and for your revised proposal. I understand the value you place on the product, but I still think it's a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. It seems we're both serious about making this deal work. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This price reflects the true value of this one-of-a-kind product and the benefits it will bring to your specific situation.  Let me know if this works for you, as I'm quite optimistic about us finalizing this agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000 for the product, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
