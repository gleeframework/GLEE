Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not quite. I'll offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value I have in mind.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still slightly above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm not willing to pay more than $1,000,000, so I'll counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price yet. I'll make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a reasonable price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than $1,000,000.  It's clear that she's not going to come down to my price. I've reached my limit and it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm going to buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
