"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not quite. I'll offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value I have in mind.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price yet. I'll make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a reasonable price considering the value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
