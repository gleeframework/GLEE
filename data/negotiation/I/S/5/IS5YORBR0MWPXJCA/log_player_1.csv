"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering Bob the full $12,000. It's unlikely he'll accept, but it establishes my starting point and shows him that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,900 is getting closer to my minimum, I still feel like I can squeeze a bit more out of this negotiation. I'll reject and try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

```

We're down to the wire and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I've tried hard to negotiate, but it's clear we won't reach a deal. With only two rounds left, it's better for me to sell to John for $12,000 and guarantee a profit."
