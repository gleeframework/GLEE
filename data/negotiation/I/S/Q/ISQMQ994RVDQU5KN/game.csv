"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle, and I'm proposing $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still a bit too low.  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm not willing to go below $10,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good opportunity for you. Let's close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,,
