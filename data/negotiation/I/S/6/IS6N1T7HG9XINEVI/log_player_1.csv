Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I've done my research, and I believe it's a bit overpriced at $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $15,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for such a low price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $11,000.  Let's find a middle ground here.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,500. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, $10,500 is closer to my minimum and still a decent profit. I'm not willing to risk losing this sale and then potentially not being able to sell to John.  This is a good compromise, and I can live with it."
