"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I've done my research, and I believe it's a bit overpriced at $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $11,000.  Let's find a middle ground here.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,500. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
