"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $110.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $130, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else!",130.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll do $127.50. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",127.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my price, but $127.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm confident we can reach a fair price that works for both of us. How about $123? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",123.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll do $126, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for a product like this, and I think you'll be happy with it.",126.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $126 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $124. This feels like a fair price, and we can finalize the deal.  If you're not comfortable with this, I'm willing to purchase the product from John.",124.0,Bob,8,
