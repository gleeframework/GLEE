"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value it holds for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,875,000?",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,875,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,500,000? That would be a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
