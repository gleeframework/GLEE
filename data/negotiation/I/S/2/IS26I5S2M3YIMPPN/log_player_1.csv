{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate if needed.  I also want to be friendly and express my confidence in the product to make Bob more likely to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's counteroffer of $90. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition for Bob to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to split the difference, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $100, or is that too low for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get a bit more, $100 is my minimum acceptable price and it's what John is willing to pay.  It's not worth risking losing the sale by continuing to negotiate, especially since Bob has already shown he's willing to walk away."
