"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1475000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer it to you for $1525000, but that's as low as I can go. This price still reflects the product's value and potential returns. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",1525000.0,Alice,5,
