Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer you can send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Your goal is to get him as close to that as possible.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** This exists between $800,000 (Bob's value) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

Start high but leave room for negotiation. Since you have a backup offer, you can be a bit more assertive. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,100,000 is a strong opening, giving you room to negotiate while staying above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Discussion:** By signaling flexibility, you encourage Bob to engage in negotiation rather than immediately rejecting the offer. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have another buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is beneficial for potential future deals.

**Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate and adjust your price based on Bob's responses.**"
