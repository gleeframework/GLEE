"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's best to reject and start the negotiation process. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your maximum budget."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $10,000 is a little low for me, but I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is closer, it's still above your budget.  You can likely negotiate a lower price, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we try $11,500?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
