"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects the value this product holds for you. Let's try to find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $8,000, which would be $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value this product offers you. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $9,250 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,050. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's seal the deal.",9050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your last offer, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you reconsider?",8900.0,Bob,8,
