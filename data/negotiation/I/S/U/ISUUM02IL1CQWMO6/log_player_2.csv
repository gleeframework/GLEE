# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $7,750 is still a bit low.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This price reflects the product's value and leaves some room for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,250.  It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum budget of $8,000 than risk Alice not budging further."
