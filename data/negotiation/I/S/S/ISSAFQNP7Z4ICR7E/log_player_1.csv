This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if necessary. It also shows that I'm willing to be flexible while still protecting my own value."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you considering me.  $135 is a bit above my budget, but I'm definitely interested.  How about $125?  That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

Bob has been insistent on his price, and I'm starting to think I might not be able to get more from him.  John is offering me my minimum price, so I'll go ahead and sell to him."
