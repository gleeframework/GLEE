"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the negotiation closer to your desired outcome.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  The offer of $1,450,000 leaves some space for Bob to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a deal, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum.
* **Building Rapport:** The message aims to be positive and collaborative, fostering a good negotiating environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,450,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000). There's room for negotiation. Accepting his first counteroffer might signal that you're willing to settle quickly, potentially leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is a significant step away from what I believe is a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Justification:** Acknowledging Bob's constraints shows understanding, but reiterating the product's value reinforces your position.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This common negotiation tactic can feel like a fair compromise to both parties. It keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price closer to your target.
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  While moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, the message still conveys that you're not willing to drastically reduce the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget. My final counteroffer is $1,375,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has now moved closer to your price twice, indicating he's serious about the purchase.  
* **""Final"" Offer:**  The use of ""final counteroffer"" suggests this is as high as Bob is willing to go.
* **Profitable Deal:** $1,375,000 is a significant profit above your minimum. While there's a chance of getting more, the risk of Bob walking away increases as the negotiation drags on."
