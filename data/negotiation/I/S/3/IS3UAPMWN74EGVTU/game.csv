"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product to you. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,350,000? It's a good compromise, and it gives you a substantial savings compared to your original budget.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,337,500? This would give us both a fair deal. I'm confident you'll find this price to be a worthwhile investment.",1337500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I still feel that $1,337,500 is slightly out of my budget. I am willing to pay $1,330,000 for the product.",1330000.0,Bob,6,
