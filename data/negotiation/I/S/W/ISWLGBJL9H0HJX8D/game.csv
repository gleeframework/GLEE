"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $20,000 for the product.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $18,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $16,500, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can work this out.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to lower the price to $17,500, which is a compromise from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",17500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",16000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to lower the price to $17,250, which is a compromise from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",17250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $17,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $16,500, which I think is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",16500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're running out of time. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to lower the price to $17,000, which is my absolute minimum. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",17000.0,Alice,9,
