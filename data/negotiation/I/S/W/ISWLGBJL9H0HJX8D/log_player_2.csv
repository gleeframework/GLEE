# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $20,000 for the product.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're running out of time. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to lower the price to $17,000, which is my absolute minimum. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $15,000.  Here's why:

* **Alice is at her minimum:** Alice has stated this is her absolute minimum price. Further negotiation is unlikely to get her lower.
* **Time is running out:**  This is the 9th round, and the deal needs to be closed soon.
* **John's price is best:** John is offering the product for $15,000, which is within Bob's budget and the best price available. 

It's better for Bob to secure the product at a good price rather than risk Alice rejecting his next counteroffer and potentially losing the deal altogether."
