Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $900,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or walk away and sell to John for the guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him for a better price, I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a significant profit for me. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll consider selling to John for the guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell. While I'd prefer to get closer to $800,000, accepting his offer is the best option right now. This ensures a sale and a decent profit, avoiding the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for the lower price."
