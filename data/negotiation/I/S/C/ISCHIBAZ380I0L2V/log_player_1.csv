Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value than Bob's estimated value. This leaves room for negotiation but still ensures I'm not immediately giving away too much.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm not asking for my full minimum value, allowing for potential counteroffers and a negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for better negotiation:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price. 
* **John is a safe backup:**  I have a backup offer from John, which provides me with security and allows me to take risks in negotiating with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is closer to what you're hoping for, it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Message:** The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential benefits of the transaction, prompting him to consider the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** I have a strong backup offer from John, which gives me the leverage to hold out for a higher price.  I can afford to risk a few more rounds of negotiation. 
* **Potential for compromise:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still looking for a lower price.  While I'm always willing to compromise,  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a firm stance:** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not budging too much from my previous counteroffer. I'm trying to signal that I'm serious about my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reinforce value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price point.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing the potential for both of us to benefit from the deal, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open-ended question:**  The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $925000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $925,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out:** While I have some time remaining, I'm starting to run out of rounds for negotiation.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price, giving me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still reach a more favorable price with Bob, even with the limited time."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 is simply not a price that works for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm also committed to achieving a fair deal. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This compromise allows us both to benefit from this transaction while respecting each other's needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering to split the difference between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($925,000), indicating a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Urgency:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints and highlighting the need to reach a deal soon, but I'm not giving up too much.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $920000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** There are only three rounds left, and Bob's offers are not getting close to my minimum.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offers.
* **Risk of losing a better deal:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John's offer and ending up with a much lower price.

It's not ideal to leave money on the table, but with limited time and a secure alternative, selling to John is the most sensible choice to maximize my potential profit."
