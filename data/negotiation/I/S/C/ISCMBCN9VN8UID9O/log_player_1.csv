Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree are between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA but leave some room for negotiation. Starting too high might make Bob walk away without even countering.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair. This offer stands for 48 hours."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting near the upper end of the ZOPA, maximizing your potential gain.
* **Time Limit:** The 48-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies you're open to discussing the price further, allowing Bob to feel he has some bargaining power. 

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you haven't lost anything. You still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price."
