Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum selling price. There's room for a substantial profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,300,000). This makes the deal highly attractive to him while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **First-Mover Advantage:**  By making Bob a strong initial offer, you increase the likelihood of closing the deal quickly and avoiding the need to sell to your backup buyer, John.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have a good understanding of Bob's financial capacity and willingness to pay. If you're unsure about his upper limit, you might start with a slightly lower offer and negotiate upwards."
