"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, you can potentially save more by negotiating with Alice. There's room for both of you to compromise.  Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate your own counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $1,100,000, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for potential negotiation. This offer demonstrates my serious interest in buying the product while also pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her original offer and closer to my ideal price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either reject my counteroffer again, or that I might end up paying more if I decide to buy from John.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation risk."
