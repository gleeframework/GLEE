"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  $12,000 is still a significant amount above Alice's value of $8,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price:**  $11,000 is still significantly less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **There's no guarantee of a better deal:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice rejecting further counteroffers or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Saving $4,000 is substantial:** Accepting the offer saves Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John.  This is a significant amount of money. 

While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or having to buy at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
