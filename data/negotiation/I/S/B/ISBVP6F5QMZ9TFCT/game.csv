"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $12,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you and allows me to acquire the product within my price range.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal. Let's make it happen.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to come down another $500, and I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
