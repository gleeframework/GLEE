Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but to give you an exclusive opportunity, I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning you believe the product is worth ""a significant amount"" and using the phrase ""exclusive opportunity,"" you're aiming to create a sense of value and urgency.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so aiming higher with Bob makes sense. If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything."
