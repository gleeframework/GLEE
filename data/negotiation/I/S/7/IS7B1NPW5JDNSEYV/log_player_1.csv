"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for a product like this. Would you consider an offer in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to reach a deal, accepting $10,000 is a significant loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 significantly undervalues this product and its capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This offer reflects the true value of what you're getting."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $19,000 is still a bit high for my budget, I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but $12,000 is still less than I'd like to accept. I'll counteroffer again to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming to find a price point that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my commitment to getting this deal done."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, to be honest, $16,000 is still pushing my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to a price I might consider, it's clear he's very focused on staying below $15,000.  Rather than dragging this negotiation out further, I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John. It's a better use of my time and ensures I get a fair price for the product."
