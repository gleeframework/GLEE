Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $71.50, which is just slightly above your target of $70. It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and may lead to a stalemate or a higher price.  It's a good deal, and you're likely to save more than if you bought from John."
