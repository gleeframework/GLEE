"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal considering the value it offers. I'm confident you'll find it extremely beneficial. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get for the product.  I'm confident I can do better with further negotiation, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,700,000 for this product.  I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1400000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $1,400,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,550,000 for this product. It's a one-time opportunity to acquire something truly valuable, and I believe it will be worth every penny for you in the long run. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1550000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1300000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I've been steadily decreasing my offers, but Bob's counteroffers are not coming close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's clear that we are far apart in our valuations.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk ending up with a price that's too low for me. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
