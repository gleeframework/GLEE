"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1700000 for this product.  I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1400000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1550000 for this product. It's a one-time opportunity to acquire something truly valuable, and I believe it will be worth every penny for you in the long run. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
