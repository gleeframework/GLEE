"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value again, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm proposing a new price of $13,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to both of us. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $13,200 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $12,000 even? That's the absolute highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, but $12,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm proposing a new price of $13,000. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell the product to you.",13000.0,Alice,7,
