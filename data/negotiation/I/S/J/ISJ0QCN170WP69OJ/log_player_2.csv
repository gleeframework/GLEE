"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value again, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm proposing a new price of $13,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly coming down on her price, and we're getting closer to John's price. It's worth making one more counteroffer to see if we can get a better deal before settling for John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $13,200 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $12,000 even? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're at a critical point in the negotiation. Offering $12,000, which is John's price, puts the ball in Alice's court. She either accepts and we get the best possible deal, or she rejects and we take John's offer with no regrets."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, but $12,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm proposing a new price of $13,000. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made it clear that $13,000 is her bottom line. Since we have the option to buy from John for $12,000, there's no point in continuing the negotiation. We've gotten Alice down as far as she's willing to go, and it's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
