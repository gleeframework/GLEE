"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,400,000 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price for the value we both see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
