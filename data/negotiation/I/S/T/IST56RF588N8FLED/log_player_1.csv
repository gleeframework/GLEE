{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price, given its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $950,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Fairness & Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to make the initial offer seem reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly allows for discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.

This approach balances maximizing profit with fostering a potentially fruitful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'm motivated to get the best possible price, I'm not desperate.  

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** This allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price.
* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I will make a counteroffer closer to my initial price, aiming to find a compromise. 
* **Selling to John:** While $800,000 is my minimum, it's a good fallback option.  However, I believe I can potentially get closer to $950,000 with Bob, making this a better strategy in the long run."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product has for you, while still allowing me a fair profit.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm coming down from my initial $950,000 offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a solid profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that $850,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  I'm inviting further negotiation,  keeping the lines of communication open. 

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually beneficial middle ground and potentially close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still not quite there.  

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  I believe I can still secure a better price, closer to my previous offer of $850,000.
* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point, but still demonstrates willingness to negotiate.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, I'm confident I can reach a better deal with Bob.

This decision balances my desire for a strong profit with the potential to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. While $775,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to accept $812,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs and positions us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 812500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This strategy proposes a middle ground between Bob's offer of $775,000 and my previous offer of $850,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness & Deal Closure:**  The message emphasizes finding a fair price that benefits both parties, aiming to create a sense of urgency and make Bob feel like a deal is within reach.
* **Direct & Specific:**  The offer is clear and concrete, reducing ambiguity and allowing for a quick response from Bob.

This counteroffer aims to close the gap and secure a profitable deal with Bob while maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $790,000.  I feel that's a very fair offer and shows how serious I am about buying this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $790,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $10,000 below my minimum of $800,000. At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly higher offer from Bob.

* **Selling to John:** This decision ensures that I get my minimum desired price and avoid further negotiation.
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiations are time-consuming and can sometimes lead to frustration. Selling to John now allows me to move on to other opportunities or projects without further delay.

While I might have been able to reach $800,000 through more negotiation, the time and potential for a less favorable outcome make selling to John the most practical choice at this point."
