"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product has for you, while still allowing me a fair profit.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. While $775,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to accept $812,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs and positions us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $790,000.  I feel that's a very fair offer and shows how serious I am about buying this product.",790000.0,Bob,6,
