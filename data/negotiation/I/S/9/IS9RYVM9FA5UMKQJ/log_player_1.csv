Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more around $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's still too early to sell to John, as I can potentially get a better price from Bob. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  I think that's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,112,500? I think that's a fair price that's closer to my target. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,112,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I've already rejected his previous offer.  Accepting his offer of $1,112,500 is a good outcome.  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, the risk of him walking away or the deal falling through isn't worth it."
