Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think $11,000 is a bit high. Can you consider $10,950? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay under $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to $11,000, I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away and I'll be left with only the $10,000 offer from John.  $10,950 is a good compromise and I can still make a decent profit."
