Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 allows for some negotiation room while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** The message is framed positively, highlighting ""special price"" and ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still likely to get a better price than the guaranteed $150 from John.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while also increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
