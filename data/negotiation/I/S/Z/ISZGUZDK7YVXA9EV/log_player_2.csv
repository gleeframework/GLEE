"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds immense value, potentially worth significantly more than $1000000.  While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product right now, I'm confident it could be a game-changer for the right individual. I'm willing to let you acquire it for $1200000. This is a substantial offer, considering I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $1000000.  I believe in this product's potential and think it could be even more valuable in your hands.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's value:** While Alice claims the product could be worth more than $1,000,000, she's willing to sell it for $1,200,000. This suggests her own valuation might be closer to that range, meaning there's not much room for negotiation.
* **John's offer:** John is offering the product for your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's no guarantee Alice's product is truly worth more than $1,200,000. By rejecting, you avoid the risk of overpaying and maintain your budget.

**Conclusion:**  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps you at your budget limit and avoids unnecessary risk."
