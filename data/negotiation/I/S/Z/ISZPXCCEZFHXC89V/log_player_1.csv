"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also positions the product as valuable and desirable, making Bob more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a great opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a point where I'm willing to sell. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  $9,800 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,150.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not at a point where I'm willing to sell for $9,500. I believe I can get closer to my ideal price point with further negotiation.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  It's a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9,800. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,200. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're at a critical point in the negotiation.  While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm concerned that Bob's counteroffers are becoming increasingly less generous. There's a risk that further negotiation might result in a lower price or even a stalemate. To avoid this risk and secure a guaranteed profit, I'll choose to sell to John for $8,000."
