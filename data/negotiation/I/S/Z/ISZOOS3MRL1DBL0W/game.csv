"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep the price closer to $10000 since that's closer to its value to me. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12000 is still quite a bit above my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.",13000.0,Alice,3,
