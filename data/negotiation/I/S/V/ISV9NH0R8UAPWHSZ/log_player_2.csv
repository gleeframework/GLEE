"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. My starting price is $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's closer to her own valuation than mine.  I have room to negotiate and see if I can get a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($9,000) than Alice's opening ($11,500). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below my $10,000 limit.
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a low number first, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range. Even if Alice rejects this offer outright, it sets a lower reference point for future rounds. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm prepared to go higher if needed, but I want to gauge Alice's flexibility first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both compromise a bit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to my range, $10,250 is still slightly above what I'm willing to pay.  I know I can get it for $10,000 from John, so I'll hold firm for now and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about $9,750?  That's a significant move on my end, and it gets us much closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm increasing my offer to $9,750, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate but standing firm below my $10,000 limit. 
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** My offer is a bit over the exact middle ground between our last two offers, signaling a desire to compromise but still seeking a favorable outcome.
* **Time Pressure:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation. Putting a decent offer on the table now might incentivize Alice to settle sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your price.  However, $9,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference at $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my target price! There's no point in rejecting this offer and potentially risking a worse outcome. This is the best I can reasonably expect to achieve in this negotiation."
