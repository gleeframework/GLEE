"I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're still in the negotiation process, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we aim for $120, and I'll throw in a special bonus that's not included in the original price?",120.0,Alice,5,
