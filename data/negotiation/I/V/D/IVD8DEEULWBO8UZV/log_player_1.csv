Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation to leave room for negotiation.
* **Not too high:** $175 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, giving me some flexibility. 
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message helps build rapport and increases the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* While I could accept this offer and sell, it wouldn't be profitable for me.
* It's better to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* I have the option of selling to John for $150, which is a better deal than accepting Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $125 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm not going too low as I want to maximize my profit, but I'm also showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer. 
* **Reiterate the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product by saying it's a ""great deal.""
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation friendly and increases the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still not high enough to make a significant profit.
* **Potential for higher:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price with a final counteroffer.
* **Safety net:**  Selling to John for $150 is always an option if I'm unable to reach a profitable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good deal, and I respect that!  How about we split the difference at $145?  That's fair for both of us, and we can finalize this transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making a final counteroffer, signaling my willingness to close the deal.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise price to demonstrate flexibility. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to increase the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Closing statement:** I'm emphasizing that $145 is a fair price for both of us and using language like ""finalize this transaction"" to encourage acceptance."
