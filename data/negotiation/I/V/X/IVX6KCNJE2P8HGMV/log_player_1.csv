Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up, increasing your profit.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** You have John as a backup buyer who will pay your minimum acceptable price, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
