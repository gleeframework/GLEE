"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $925000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise between our initial offers.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one last compromise, but I'd like to propose a price of $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to me. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.",850000.0,Alice,9,
