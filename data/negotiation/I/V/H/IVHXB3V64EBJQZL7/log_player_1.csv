"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make an offer of $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while also ensuring I get a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $92.50 is still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. But I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. Let's meet halfway again. How about $93.75?  It's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 93.75}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the importance of a fair price for both parties.  This should encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'd like to try to get a bit closer. How about we meet at $91.25? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm starting to doubt Bob's willingness to pay my minimum price.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's better to secure the guaranteed $100 from John."
