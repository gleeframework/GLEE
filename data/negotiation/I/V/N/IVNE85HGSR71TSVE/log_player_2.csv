"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,800,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Bob offers $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation.  He's aiming for a price that is closer to John's offer, but still potentially attractive to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John. There's a chance he can get a better price from Alice, but he doesn't want to risk getting stuck with a higher price. He'll make another counteroffer."

Bob is offering $1,500,000, which is the same price as John's offer. This is a strong position, and he's giving Alice a chance to accept his offer or risk losing the sale. He is putting the pressure on Alice to make a decision."
