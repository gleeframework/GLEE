"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to buy from Alice. The price is significantly lower than what Bob is willing to pay, meaning there's likely room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($500,000) will encourage further negotiation.  $400,000 is a substantial drop, forcing Alice to consider whether she's willing to go that low.  This aggressive opening sets the stage for a more favorable deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there's still room for improvement.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and accepting $450,000 would leave a significant amount on the table.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially secure a price closer to his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's raised his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but still leaving room for Alice to concede further.  $425,000 is a more moderate adjustment, encouraging Alice to see the potential for a deal without feeling pressured to accept a significantly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $437,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $437,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's last offer, and the difference is now relatively small.  There is a good chance that further negotiation will only yield minor savings.  Considering the limited rounds remaining, accepting Alice's offer is the most practical option at this point. Bob is still able to buy the product for significantly less than what John is offering, making it a favorable deal."
