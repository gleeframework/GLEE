Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product which I believe would be valuable to you for $19,000. It's a unique item and I'm confident it's worth the price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to start negotiations higher to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering the product at $19,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing a sale above my minimum.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value, the message implies it's something special (""unique"", ""worth the price"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on the information provided. Depending on Bob's personality, negotiation style, and the nature of the product, different approaches might be more effective."
