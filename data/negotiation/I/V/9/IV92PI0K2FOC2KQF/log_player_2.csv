"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. Even if the negotiation fails, you have the option to buy from John for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It also leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this will trigger a back-and-forth that leads to a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget. While I'd love to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation that might lead to me having to buy from John."
