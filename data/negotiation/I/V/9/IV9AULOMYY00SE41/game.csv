"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is the maximum I can afford while still making this purchase worthwhile. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value while being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. After re-evaluating the market and considering your latest offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it still reflects the product's worth while being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground. While I value this product, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. My final offer is $900,000. This reflects the maximum I can afford while still making this purchase beneficial. I hope we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to make a decision, but I'm not willing to accept $900,000. I believe the product's value is still worth more than that. Considering our previous negotiations, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,025,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth while being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
