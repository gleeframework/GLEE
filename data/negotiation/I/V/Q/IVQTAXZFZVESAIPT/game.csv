"Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Can you meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe its value warrants a price closer to $1,000,000. Let's compromise at $980,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",980000.0,Alice,5,
