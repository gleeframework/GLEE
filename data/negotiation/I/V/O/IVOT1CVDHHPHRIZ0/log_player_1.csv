Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This price is above my minimum threshold of $120, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, but I am still confident that I can secure a better price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to Bob, and I hope we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $132 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum threshold, and further negotiation might not be worth the risk of him walking away. I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
