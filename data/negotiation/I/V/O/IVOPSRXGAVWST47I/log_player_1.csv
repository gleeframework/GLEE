Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 4

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. At this rate, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's beneficial for me, especially with only a few rounds left.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
