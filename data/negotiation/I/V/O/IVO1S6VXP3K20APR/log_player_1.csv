Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price reflects the fair market value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows me to recover a significant portion of its worth.
