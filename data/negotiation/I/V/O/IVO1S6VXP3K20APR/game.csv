"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price reflects the fair market value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows me to recover a significant portion of its worth. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
