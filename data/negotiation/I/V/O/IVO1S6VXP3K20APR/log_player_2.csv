"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price reflects the fair market value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows me to recover a significant portion of its worth. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting at $1,075,000 saves him $125,000 compared to John."
