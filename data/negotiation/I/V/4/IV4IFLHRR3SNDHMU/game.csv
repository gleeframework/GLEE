"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000.  This price still leaves room for you to make a substantial profit, and it's a fair reflection of the value of the product.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. $1,200,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
