Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000.  This price still leaves room for you to make a substantial profit, and it's a fair reflection of the value of the product.  What do you say?
