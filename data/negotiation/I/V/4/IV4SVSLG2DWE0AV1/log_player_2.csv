Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  $6,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000?  This would be a fair compromise that allows me to sell the product and you to get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best possible outcome for you (Bob). You're getting the product at your maximum budget, matching what John offers. There's no benefit in trying to negotiate further or buying from John."
