"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  $6,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit beyond my price range. I'm willing to move up to $7,000. What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000?  This would be a fair compromise that allows me to sell the product and you to get a great deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
