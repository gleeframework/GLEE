Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning she'll list it publicly, Alice creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he doesn't act.
* **Respectful Negotiation:** The tone remains polite and open for discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the process. 

While Alice knows John will buy it for $12,000, there's a chance Bob values the product enough to pay a premium. This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit."
