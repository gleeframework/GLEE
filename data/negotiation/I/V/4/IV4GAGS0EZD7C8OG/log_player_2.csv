"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can definitely do better than $120.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $80. There's room to negotiate."

While $110 is closer to your desired price, you can still try to get it lower.  You're willing to pay $150, so there's still some wiggle room."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105, which is still a good price for you considering your minimum selling price.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $105 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit short on my minimum selling price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $105. I'm offering it to you for $107.50. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:

You've negotiated down to a price that's within your budget and still a decent profit for Alice. At this point, it's not worth risking a further counteroffer that could potentially lead to a stalemate or you having to buy from John for a higher price."
