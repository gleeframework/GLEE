Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:

The product is worth $8,000 to me, and Bob's offer is below that. I'll try to negotiate a better price before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While his offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price of $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so let's settle on $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
