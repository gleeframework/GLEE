Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,""  you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth without directly stating it's worth less to him if he doesn't take the deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, but rather invites Bob to share his thoughts, implying a willingness to negotiate. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, he doesn't know your minimum.  A significantly higher offer might make him walk away.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be left with the product. This allows you to be slightly bolder in your initial offer."
