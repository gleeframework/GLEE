"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000.  By rejecting her offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a better price or ultimately buy from John for $1,000,000. There's a chance Alice might come down in price, allowing you to save even more."
