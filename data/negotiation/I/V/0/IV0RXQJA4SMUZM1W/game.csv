"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $13000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $11000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $11000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11500.  Let's try to bridge the gap and make this deal work.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I understand you're still looking for a lower price, but $11500 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
