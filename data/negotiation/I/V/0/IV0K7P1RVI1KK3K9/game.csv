"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,3,
