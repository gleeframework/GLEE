"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its worth to you is $80.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $70.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? That's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's worth to you is $80.",75.0,Bob,4,
