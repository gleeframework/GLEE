Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could sell it for elsewhere. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000 is a good starting point:** It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, making it attractive to Bob. It also leaves room for negotiation if necessary.
* **The message is friendly and persuasive:**  It highlights the benefit for both of us and sets the stage for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **The offer is open to negotiation:** The message implies that I'm open to discussing the price further, which could lead to a successful outcome. 

**Important Note:**  I'm keeping John's offer in the back of my mind as a safety net, but I'm hoping to find a solution that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget, I am only able to offer $900,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not desperate to sell the product and John offers a guaranteed higher price. 

I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a compromise closer to my desired price point. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I highlight that $1,000,000 is a fair compromise for both of us, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to discussion:** The message implies that I'm still open to further discussion, potentially leading to a successful deal.

**Important Note:** I'm still aware of John's offer, but I'm determined to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob before resorting to Plan B."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've reviewed my budget again and am comfortable increasing my offer to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still not close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I've already made significant concessions, and further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to result in a price that meets my needs. 

Therefore, I've decided to take the guaranteed offer from John, as it ensures I get the value I'm seeking for the product."
