"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget, I am only able to offer $900,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
