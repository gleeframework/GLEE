Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for this valuable item."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the amount.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to earn more than Bob's initial counteroffer.  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $920,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob. I'm confident that I can sell to John for a significantly better price.  It's time to move on to a sure thing."
