"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for my budget. How about we bring it down a bit? Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below the $1,000,000 mark. Would you be open to $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $1,050,000? It's a small step back towards my original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience with this negotiation. I'm willing to nudge my budget a bit to try and find a deal. How about $1,010,000?  That's a significant move on my end.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,010,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $1,075,000? It's a small step back towards your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but this deal only works if we can find a number that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,025,000.  Let's get this done.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we try $1,062,500? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1062500.0,Alice,9,
