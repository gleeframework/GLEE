Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $18,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still come down while staying above your minimum.
* **Confidence and Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, which might make Bob more amenable to a higher price. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy gives you the best chance to maximize your profit."
