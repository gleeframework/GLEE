# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it brings to you is worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $9,500. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price or simply buy it from John for the price you're comfortable with."
