"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000.  This price reflects its quality and potential. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, $12000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $13500. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12500.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you can see it's a fair offer.  Let's make this deal happen!",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $12000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
