"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000. This is still a fair price, given the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and we're getting closer to a deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're close to selling to John, but I'm still hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's only $25,000 above your minimum.  Let's make this deal happen!",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,225,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product for $1,237,500. This is a compromise, and I hope we can finalize this deal.  If we can't agree, I'll have to move forward with John.",1237500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm eager to make this deal, $1,237,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,212,500.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer.",1212500.0,Bob,8,
