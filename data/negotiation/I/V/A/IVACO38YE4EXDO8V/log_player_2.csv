Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000. This is still a fair price, given the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.
