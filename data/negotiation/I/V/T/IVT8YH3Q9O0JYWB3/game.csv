"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $90 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit further, how about $105?  That's still a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $100? This is a great deal for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. ",100.0,Alice,5,
