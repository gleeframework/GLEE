Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $22,000."", ""product_price"": 22000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). While this might seem like a deterrent, it aims to establish the product's worth in Bob's mind and potentially anchor his perception at a higher level.
* **Below John's Offer:** The price is still significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer ($15,000).  This provides a safety net for Alice, ensuring a profitable sale even if Bob rejects the offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to test Bob's willingness to pay a premium. 

* **Best Case:** Bob, unaware of John's offer, might perceive the high price as an indicator of high value and accept it, even with a markup. 
* **Negotiation:**  If Bob counters, Alice has room to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that is still more profitable than selling to John. 
* **Worst Case:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at a price that meets her minimum requirement."
