"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $18,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $20,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $20,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $19,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.",19000.0,Bob,4,
