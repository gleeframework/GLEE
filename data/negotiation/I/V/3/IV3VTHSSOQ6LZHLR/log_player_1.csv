{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can potentially get more if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 
I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While I'm running out of time, $11,000 is too low.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm lowering my price again to $12,500. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept.  If he doesn't, I'll have to consider selling to John to ensure I get at least my minimum."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob isn't budging much, and we're running out of time.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000, and John is offering that price.  It's time to secure the deal."
