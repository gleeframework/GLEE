Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a reasonable price. However, I am hoping to keep my budget within $1200000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1.
