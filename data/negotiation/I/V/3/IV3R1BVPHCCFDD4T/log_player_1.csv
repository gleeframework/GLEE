Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to maximize my potential earnings. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate towards a price that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price for the product."
