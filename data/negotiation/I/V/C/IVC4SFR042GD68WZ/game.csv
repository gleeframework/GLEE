"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, considering its value to me and its current market conditions. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds $1,400,000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,750,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there. $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle, I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
