"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to come closer to my value, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to accept that. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit more, but still keeping it well above Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still too low, but he's moving in the right direction. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about negotiating but also that I'm willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than I'd like, but we're getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to offer $12,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still getting a good price and am willing to be flexible to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that I'll run out of rounds and be forced to accept a price lower than I'd like.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John and move on."
