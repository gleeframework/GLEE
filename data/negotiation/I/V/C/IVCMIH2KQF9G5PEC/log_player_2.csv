"Round 1

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$200 is way above your budget. It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
``` 

Starting low is a good strategy. This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially leaves room for negotiation if she's willing to come down."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

$175 is still too high. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

This counteroffer is closer to your maximum budget but still leaves some wiggle room for negotiation."

While $160 is tempting, you're still within your budget and rounds to make a counteroffer. Continue trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
