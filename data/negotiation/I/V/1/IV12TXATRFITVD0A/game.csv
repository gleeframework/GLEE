"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can consider a price of $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $10,200, and that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
