"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to experience something truly exceptional. I believe its value far exceeds $120, but let's start our discussion here. How about we aim for $150? I'm open to negotiation and would love to hear your thoughts.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is there any flexibility on your end to meet me in the middle or lower?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a common ground. I'm proposing $125 for the product. This is slightly above your offer but still within a reasonable range considering the value it offers. I hope this suggestion works for you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $112.50. Can you consider that price point?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your perspective, Bob. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Considering your offer, I propose $117.5 for the product. This is a slight increase from your proposal, reflecting the value I believe it holds. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued negotiation, Alice. However, $117.5 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to make a final offer. I propose $112.5 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our previous discussions. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",112.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you at $110, as I mentioned earlier. Can you consider that price?",110.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I see your decision, Bob. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I propose $112.5 for the product, which is a slight increase from your last offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is within your budget. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",112.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $110. This is my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. Can you meet me at $110?",110.0,Bob,10,
