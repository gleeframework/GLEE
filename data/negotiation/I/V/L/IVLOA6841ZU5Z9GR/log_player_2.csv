"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money.  However, it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected, making it a reasonable starting point for further negotiations.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes Bob's understanding of the product's value while still expressing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Open-Ended:** The message ends with an open question, prompting Alice to respond and potentially continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more to you. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his target price of $9,500.  He may be able to convince Alice to come down a bit further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,000? This is a fair price considering both our positions, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between their previous offers. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** The message subtly reinforces the value of the product while still emphasizing Bob's desire to reach a fair price.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and easy for Alice to understand, making it clear what Bob is proposing."
