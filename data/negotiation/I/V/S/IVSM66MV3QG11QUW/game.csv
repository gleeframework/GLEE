"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
