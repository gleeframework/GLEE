Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, which gives him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A higher opening price could make Bob immediately reject the offer, shutting down the negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum of $8,000, it's still lower than the $9,500 I initially proposed. I believe I can get a better price. 

I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Bob I'm willing to compromise while still pursuing a favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,000. This is a slight concession from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still leaves some room for negotiation and is significantly higher than Bob's latest offer. This keeps the momentum going while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Bob walking away or me needing to sell to John for a lower price outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal.  It's time to close the deal and secure a profit."
