Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see value in. Given its unique nature, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its potential.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation while staying well above Bob's valuation and your minimum price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $950,000 creates a sense of value and leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer. This increases the chance of securing a deal closer to your desired range.
* **Alternative Secured:** You have the security of John's offer at $1,000,000, so there's less pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects, you can always lower the price slightly, but remain firm on a figure above your $1,000,000 minimum."
