"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer the product to you for $10,250. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
