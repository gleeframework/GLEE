"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  Would you be open to discussing that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1350000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
