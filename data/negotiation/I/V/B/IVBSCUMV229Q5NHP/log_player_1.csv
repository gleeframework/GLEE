Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to go lower.  You want to see if Bob is willing to meet your valuation. 
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is straightforward and implies the value of the product without being overly aggressive. 

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Best Case Scenario:** Bob values the perceived exclusivity and accepts the $10,000 offer.
* **Worst Case Scenario:** Bob rejects the offer, and you sell it to John for your desired price.

This approach minimizes risk while maximizing potential profit."
