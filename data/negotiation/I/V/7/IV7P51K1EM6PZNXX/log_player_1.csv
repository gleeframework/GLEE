{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer of $8,000. I've already made a few concessions, and I'm starting to run out of time. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $12,000.  I'll still be making a decent profit, and it's better than ending up with nothing."
