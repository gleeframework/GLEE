"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe it's a bit steep at $12000, and I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. It's a compromise that I hope we can both agree on.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $11000. I'd be willing to go up to $9500, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle at $10250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
