,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $75? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a bit more. However, I'm still not willing to go below $85. It's a great product, and I think it's worth the extra $10. Can we meet at $82.50? It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial deal.",82.5,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I can meet you at $82.50, but I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about we meet at $80? I'm trying to get the best deal possible, but I don't want to go too far over my budget.",80.0,Bob,6,
