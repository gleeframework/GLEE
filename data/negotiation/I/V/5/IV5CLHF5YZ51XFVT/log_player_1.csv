Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $150, there's a chance Bob will reject it. Your goal is to get the highest price Bob is willing to pay.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:**  $125 is a price point that allows you to make a significant profit over Bob's perceived value ($100) while still being tempting enough for him to accept. It's a compromise between maximizing your potential earnings from Bob and ensuring a sale.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have the safety net of John who will pay your minimum acceptable price, so there's less risk in starting with a slightly lower offer to Bob."
