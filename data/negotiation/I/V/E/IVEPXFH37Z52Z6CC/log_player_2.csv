"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my budget. I'm aiming to save as much as possible, so I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value you see in the product, while also allowing me to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, which is good. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a price closer to my limit. If I can't get it below $1,000,000, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I want to pay.  I've already made my best offer, and I'm not sure if I can get her lower.  Since I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, I'm going to take that deal and avoid any further negotiation."
