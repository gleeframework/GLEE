"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't commit to $12,000. My budget allows me to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Could we find a middle ground?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's closer to my target price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This offer is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows you to make a significant profit while still being within your budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",10500.0,Alice,5,
