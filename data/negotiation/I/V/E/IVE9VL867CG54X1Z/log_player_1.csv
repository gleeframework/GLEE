"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't commit to $12,000. My budget allows me to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Could we find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to Bob ($15,000) and my own minimum acceptable price ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's closer to my target price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob clearly recognizes the value of the product and is willing to negotiate. I'm going to counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This offer is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows you to make a significant profit while still being within your budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
