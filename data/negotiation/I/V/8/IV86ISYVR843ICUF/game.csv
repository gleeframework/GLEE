"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000.  Would that be feasible?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a good compromise, and I believe we can close the deal here. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
