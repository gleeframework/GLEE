"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer in its field. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $900,000. Let's see if we can work together to make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $750,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal work.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $825,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to move forward with the deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in coming down, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $780,000. This is a fair price that demonstrates my seriousness in wanting to acquire this product, and I believe it's a good starting point for reaching an agreement.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $780,000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that we've reached the optimal price for this product. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to make another concession. My revised offer is $810,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. However, $810,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $790,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my serious intent to purchase. I believe this price is fair and allows us to close the deal without further delays.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $815,000. This price point is more in line with the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",815000.0,Alice,7,
