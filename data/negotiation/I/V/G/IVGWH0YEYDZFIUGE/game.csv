"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects the product's unique benefits and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints.  While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to make a concession.  I'm prepared to accept $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both the product's value and your financial limits.  Let's seal the deal at this price.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
