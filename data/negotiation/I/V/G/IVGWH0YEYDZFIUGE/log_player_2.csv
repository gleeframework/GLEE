Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects the product's unique benefits and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints.  While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to make a concession.  I'm prepared to accept $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both the product's value and your financial limits.  Let's seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $50,000 less than John's price and $300,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better price, and you risk Alice becoming less willing to negotiate. 
* **Reaching the Limit:** You're getting close to your $1,500,000 limit. 

While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings might not be worth the risk of losing the deal."
