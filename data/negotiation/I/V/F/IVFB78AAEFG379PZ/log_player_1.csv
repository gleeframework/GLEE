Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $79 is close to my minimum, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob is still not willing to come up to my desired price.  I've reached a point where my time is more valuable than trying to squeeze out a few more dollars.  I'll sell to John for $80 and move on."
