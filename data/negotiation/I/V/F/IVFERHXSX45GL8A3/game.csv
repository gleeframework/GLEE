,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. Is that something you'd be interested in?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're not too far apart, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $12,000. How about we compromise at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. I'm willing to go up to $12,750, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12,750, Bob. However, I'm still not at my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $13,250. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $13,250 is still too high for me. I'm firm at $12,750.  It's a fair price, and it's the best I can offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I may have to look at other options.",12750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm at $12,750, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you in the middle. Let's try $13,125. If that's still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",13125.0,Alice,9,
