I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while still exceeding my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm confident that Bob will likely counter with a lower offer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  $600,000 is simply not acceptable, and I'm confident I can get a better price, even if I have to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,250,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his range. I believe this will encourage him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer, while still ensuring I get a decent profit and don't fall below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still far below my minimum value. I'm going to reject it and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000, which is still a decent amount, but represents a further concession.  I believe this price is a fair compromise, and if Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum value, and I'm tired of negotiating.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
