"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,200,000.  This is my best offer, considering the value I see in the product.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider and present your offer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  However, my initial pricing is rooted in the significant long-term value this product brings, which I believe goes beyond the immediate assessment. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I understand your perspective on the product's long-term value, my budget remains a constraint.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but I can't go beyond $1,400,000.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limitations.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
