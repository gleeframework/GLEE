"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, it's too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. How about we settle at $975,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,025,000.  This would be a significant gain for you considering the value you place on the product.  I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
