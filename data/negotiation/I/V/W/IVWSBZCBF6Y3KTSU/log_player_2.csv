**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $12,000
* **Your maximum price:** $15,000
* **John's price:** $15,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John.  Even though you could get it for less than $12,000 if you negotiated further, this is a good deal that meets your criteria."
