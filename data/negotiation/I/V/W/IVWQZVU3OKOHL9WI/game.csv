"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $750000 for this product.  This is a fair offer that reflects the value I place on it.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $775000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",775000.0,Alice,5,
