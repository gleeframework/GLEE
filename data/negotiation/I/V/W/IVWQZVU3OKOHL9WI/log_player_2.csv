"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $900000. This is a fair price considering its rarity and the benefits it can bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price I'm willing to pay from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal. There's still room for compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $775000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any lower.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $775,000 is getting closer to my counteroffer of $750,000.  While I would prefer to pay even less, accepting this offer saves me $425,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal for me, and it seems like we've reached a point where further negotiation might be unproductive."
