"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high.  There's plenty of room for negotiation before approaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still comfortably above Alice's valuation of the product. This leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a price well below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your offer, the value of this product is significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down $100,000, but we're still far from a price that's a good deal for both of us. Continuing the negotiation is worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down Alice, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to get a feel for Alice's bottom line. It's possible she might accept this offer since it matches her valuation. If not, it will prompt her to either reveal her absolute minimum or move closer to my desired range."
