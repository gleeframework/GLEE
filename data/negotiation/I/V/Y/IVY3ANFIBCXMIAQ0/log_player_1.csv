Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring Alice a significant profit.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $12,000 might scare Bob away. This offer strikes a balance between profit and the risk of losing the sale to John."
