Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still being an attractive deal for Bob (he saves $150,000). 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale with John."
