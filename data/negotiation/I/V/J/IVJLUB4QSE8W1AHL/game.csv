"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",7250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting close.  I'd be willing to do $7,100 to wrap this up. What do you say?",7100.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $7,150, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",7150.0,Alice,7,
