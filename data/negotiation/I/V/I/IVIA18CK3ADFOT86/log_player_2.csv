{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting very close to my target. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll become stubborn and I might end up paying more or even lose the deal. Accepting this offer secures the product for me at a price that's within my budget and saves me from buying from John at a higher price."
