"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer that's still within Alice's profit margin ($100) but significantly lower than the initial offer. This shows good faith and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's ideal price:** $108 is only $3 more than Bob's initial counteroffer of $105. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Bob has already rejected an offer and has limited rounds left. Accepting this offer ensures a deal without risking further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a missed opportunity.
* **John's offer is still available as a backup:** If Bob wants to continue negotiating, he can still fall back on John's offer.  

While Bob could try to get closer to his ideal price, the risk of losing the deal altogether or ending up with a worse price from John makes accepting this offer the most sensible choice at this point."
