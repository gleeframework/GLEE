"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. This reflects its value in my eyes, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1500000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1750000.  This price still allows for a substantial profit for you and reflects the unique value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you $1625000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product.  I believe this is a good compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
