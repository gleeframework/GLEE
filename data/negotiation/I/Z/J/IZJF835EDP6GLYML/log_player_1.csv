Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's an approach to crafting your offer, keeping in mind the negotiation dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its potential to generate significant value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High but Reasonable Starting Point:** You're aiming high ($1,400,000) to maximize your potential profit, knowing Bob values it at $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while staying above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message highlights the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:**  Framing it as mutually beneficial encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you know Bob tends to negotiate aggressively, you might start slightly lower to provide more bargaining space. 
* **Relationship Importance:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly more generous offer might be strategic.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're on a tight timeline, you might adjust your approach to encourage a faster decision."
