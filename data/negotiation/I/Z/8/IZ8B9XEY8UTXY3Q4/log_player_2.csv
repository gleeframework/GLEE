"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering the product at that price, you have no incentive to accept the offer. You can get the product from John for the same price.  Rejecting the offer keeps your options open in case you can find a better deal."
