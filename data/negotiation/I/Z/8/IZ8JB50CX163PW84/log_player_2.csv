"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also shows that I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's compromise is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to reject her offer and make another counteroffer. I'm still willing to pay $10,000, and I'm hoping Alice will meet me at that price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept it just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can sell the product to you for $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice is still not budging, and her latest offer is even higher than before. I think it's time to take a step back and consider my options. I've already offered $10,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Since Alice is not willing to meet me at that price, I think I'll choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.
