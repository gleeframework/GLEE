"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also shows that I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit stuck on the price. I'm willing to pay $10000, and I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you consider my offer and see if we can make a deal?",10000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that $10000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept it just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can sell the product to you for $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,,
