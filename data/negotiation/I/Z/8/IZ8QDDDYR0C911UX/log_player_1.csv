Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases my chances of a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $100. It leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I make a good profit if he accepts.
* **Encouraging Message:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting ""value"" rather than just price, to make the offer more enticing."
