Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and close to my desired amount. It's also important to remember that Bob might not be willing to negotiate further. Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, but this offer secures a higher profit for me."
