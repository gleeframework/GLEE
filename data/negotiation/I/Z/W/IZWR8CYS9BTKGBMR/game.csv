"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to get a great deal on this incredible item.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $725,000? That would make this a great deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
