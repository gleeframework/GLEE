"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our initial discussion.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's true value and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,100,000. It's a significant investment for you, and it's important for me to ensure I'm getting fair value for this unique product. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to consider a final price of $1,075,000. This leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I'm not sacrificing too much.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
