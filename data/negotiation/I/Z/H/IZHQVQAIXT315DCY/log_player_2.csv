"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product, I assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to let it go for a price that would be mutually beneficial. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1500000? This gives you a good deal while still ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price of $1,500,000. I think I can get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is a better deal for me. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
