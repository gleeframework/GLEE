"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I know it's a premium price, but I believe its value to you is high. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try a price that's closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,700,000. This reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
