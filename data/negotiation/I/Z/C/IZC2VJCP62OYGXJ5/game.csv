"Alice, $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is significantly lower.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is closer to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
