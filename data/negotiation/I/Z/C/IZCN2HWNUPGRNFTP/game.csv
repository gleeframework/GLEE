,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to discuss the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be interested in buying it for $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,750.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $8,250?  This is a fair price that's within my budget, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm prepared to spend.  I'm willing to offer $8,250 one more time. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",8250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $8,375, which is just a small concession from my previous offer. This is my final price, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8375.0,Alice,7,
