Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, I can still do better. I will counter Bob's offer and try to get a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. Would you be willing to go up to $100? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'd be willing to go up to $95. Can we meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $95 is a good compromise and much better than selling to John. I'll accept Bob's offer."
