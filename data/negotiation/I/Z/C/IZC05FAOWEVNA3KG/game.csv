"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
