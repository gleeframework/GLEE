"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you. I'm willing to part with it for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is within your budget, there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further. Rejecting her initial offer opens the door for negotiation. If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $150."
