"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Since the maximum value of the product is $15,000 to Bob, there's no reason to immediately accept the offer. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, leaving room for negotiation.  A lower price is offered to create room for bargaining.  Alice will likely reject this offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a lower price by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows he's willing to pay more but still wants to get a better price than Alice's offer.  The goal is to meet somewhere in the middle and find a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is now within Bob's acceptable range and significantly lower than John's price of $15,000. While Bob could try for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and the time constraint (only 5 rounds left) make accepting this offer the most logical decision."
