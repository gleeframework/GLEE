Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. While $1,150,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for something a bit higher. Would you consider $1,250,000? I'm confident this price accurately reflects the value you'll gain from this product.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,200,000.  It's better to secure the product at John's price now rather than risk the negotiations failing and having to buy from him at the last minute anyway."
