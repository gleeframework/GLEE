"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still possible to potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Since you don't know Alice's minimum price, there's a chance you could secure a lower price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While there's always the possibility of getting a slightly lower price, it's becoming riskier to keep negotiating.  If Alice rejects your next counteroffer, you might be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000.  It's a good deal at $850,000, so it's time to accept and move on."
