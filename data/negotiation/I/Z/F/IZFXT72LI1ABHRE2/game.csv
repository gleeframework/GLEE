"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $9,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is still too high for me. Let's try $10,500. That's a fair compromise and a good starting point for a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
