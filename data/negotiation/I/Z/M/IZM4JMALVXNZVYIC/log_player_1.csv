"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) to give me room to negotiate.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling flexibility to encourage Bob to engage in a conversation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the product's value to Bob. 

This strategy aims to start a negotiation while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 I value the product at. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can still sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer.

I'm choosing to reject the offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer ($110) and his offer ($90). 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing that the price is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Closing the gap:**  This counteroffer moves us closer to a potential agreement while still staying above my minimum value. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that satisfies both parties and moves us closer to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're still not willing to go as low as I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $92.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. 
* **Further negotiation potential:** I can still potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** I can still sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

I'm choosing to reject the offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can reach a more favorable price for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $92.50 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we settle at $94?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** I'm making a small counteroffer, only increasing the price by $1.50. This shows I'm open to compromise but still aiming for a slightly higher price.
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting that this price is still a great deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he will get from the product.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to go a little higher without risking a complete breakdown in negotiations.

This strategy aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired price while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $94, but I'm willing to meet you at $92. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited negotiation time:** We're already in Round 6, and with only 4 rounds remaining, the time for further negotiation is shrinking.  
* **Guaranteed profit:** John is offering me $100, which is a sure thing and meets my minimum requirement.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of further negotiation failing and ending up with nothing is too high. Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and I'm better off taking that secure option."
