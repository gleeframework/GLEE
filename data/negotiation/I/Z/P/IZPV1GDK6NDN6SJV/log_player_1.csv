``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum desired amount. It also signals that I am confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I won't sell for less than $10,000. I'll counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is my best offer. This reflects the product's value, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,750?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I'm sticking to my guns and will counteroffer again. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $8,750 is still below my bottom line. Let's meet in the middle.  I'll offer you the product for $9,125. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 9125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $9,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum desired amount of $10,000. It's also a fair compromise, considering our back-and-forth. Accepting his offer is the best move at this point."
