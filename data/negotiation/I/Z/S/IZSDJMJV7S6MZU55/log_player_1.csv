{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates your willingness to work with Bob to find a mutually beneficial price.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than the value you'd like to get for the product. You can likely do better with a counteroffer. It's important to remember that Bob is clearly interested, and you can use that to your advantage during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is getting close to your minimum, it's still less than you'd ideally like.  You've already shown you're willing to negotiate, but it's important to maintain your position and potentially see if you can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting uncomfortably close to your minimum, and further negotiation seems unlikely to get you much higher.  Considering that John is willing to pay your minimum of $8,000, it makes sense to sell to John to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could potentially lead to a lower price."
