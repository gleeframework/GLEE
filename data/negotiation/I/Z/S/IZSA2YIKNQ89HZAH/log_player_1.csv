Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount from your minimum price:** This shows Bob you're willing to negotiate and makes the offer appealing. 
* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers lower, you have space to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, you can always stop the negotiation with Bob and sell to John for $1,200,000, so you're not taking a huge risk by offering this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to accept.  While it's tempting to take $900,000, you're better off rejecting his offer and trying to negotiate a higher price. You have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows you're not willing to settle for his initial price.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** It demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Close to Bob's perceived value:**  It allows for potential compromise and leaves room for further discussion.

Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so you're in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to move a little. How about $975,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While his offer is higher than the previous one, it's still not worth risking a deal with John for a higher price. 

You have a guaranteed sale to John for a much better price. It's better to reject Bob's offer and proceed with your counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:**  It demonstrates your unwillingness to accept his current offer.
* **Is lower than your previous offer:** It shows you're willing to compromise and move towards a deal. 
* **Is closer to the middle ground:** It leaves room for Bob to counteroffer again, but it also pushes the negotiation closer to your desired price.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $1,200,000 if you feel Bob is not serious about reaching a deal."
