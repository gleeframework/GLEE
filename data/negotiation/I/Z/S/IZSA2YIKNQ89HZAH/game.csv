"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to move a little. How about $975,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
