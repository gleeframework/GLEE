Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you.  While my asking price is confidential, I'm willing to offer you a significant discount given its potential value. Would you consider an offer of $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible since John is our guaranteed backup.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. We need to offer a price that's significantly lower than his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting us somewhere above his perceived value.

By offering a price of $1,300,000, we are:

* **Significantly above Bob's perceived value:** This increases the chances of a deal while leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Significantly below our guaranteed sale price:** This ensures a substantial profit even if we need to negotiate down slightly."
