"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to maximize my potential earnings. I have no information about Bob's valuation, so I'm aiming high, leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $9,750. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more.  I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still being within a range that benefits me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,600. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and  $9,600 is a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than what I would get from John, and we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. There's a risk of further negotiations decreasing the price, so I'm accepting this offer to secure the deal."
