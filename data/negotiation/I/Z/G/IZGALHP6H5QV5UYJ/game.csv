"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a more reasonable price. How about $800000? This is my maximum offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my time constraints.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $800000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1200000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair price considering we're both trying to find a solution. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both flexible.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $1100000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's my absolute maximum.  I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  However, $1050000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's my absolute final offer.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
