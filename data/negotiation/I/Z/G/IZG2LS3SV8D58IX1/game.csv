"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some flexibility in the pricing. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $900000. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $950000?  This price still leaves room for you to benefit significantly, while allowing me to achieve my target. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $920000? This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, but I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet in the middle from here.",920000.0,Bob,4,
