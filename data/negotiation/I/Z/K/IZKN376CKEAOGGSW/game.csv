"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. This is my top price for now.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1000000 is a fair starting point, I believe a price of $1100000 better reflects the true value this product can deliver to your business.  It's a significant investment, but one that will pay dividends for years to come.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not sure it's worth $1100000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1010000.",1010000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1010000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1050000 for this product.  It's a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable accepting $1000000.  I'm willing to come down to $1025000, which is a compromise that would make both of us happy. This is my final offer.  Let's close the deal and move forward.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
