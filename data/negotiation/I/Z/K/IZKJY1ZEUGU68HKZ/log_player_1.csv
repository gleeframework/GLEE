Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're comfortable with $8,000, so this gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob would still be getting a good deal at $9,500.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price. 

Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  You're willing to sell to John for that amount, so it's not worth settling for less. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While you'd prefer to get closer to your ideal price, accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could result in a lower price or no sale at all."
