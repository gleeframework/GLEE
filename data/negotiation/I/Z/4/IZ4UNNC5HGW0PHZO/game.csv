"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $20000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15000.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on it and the effort I put into acquiring it.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I can only go up to $13500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value you place on it and the effort I put into acquiring it.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $14000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to be honest with you, if we can't meet on this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",14000.0,Bob,6,
