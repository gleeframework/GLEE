"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer as the product is worth $800,000 to him. This will allow us to negotiate and hopefully settle on a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm holding out for a higher price. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm dropping my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit. I believe this price is reasonable considering Bob's willingness to pay $800,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price further, showing flexibility and demonstrating my desire to close the deal. This price is a reasonable compromise and still allows me to earn a significant profit."

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to accept the minimum price I set for myself, knowing it is still a good deal for Bob.  I hope he accepts, as I'm not willing to go lower."
