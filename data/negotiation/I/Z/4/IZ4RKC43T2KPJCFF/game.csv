"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000, which is a fair and reasonable offer considering the product's worth to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a fair price, but I need to consider my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $14000, which is a compromise that should work for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $14500 at this point. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $14500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle once more.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I understand that we're close, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get at least $14200. I'm counteroffering at $14200. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",14200.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13900, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",13900.0,Alice,9,
