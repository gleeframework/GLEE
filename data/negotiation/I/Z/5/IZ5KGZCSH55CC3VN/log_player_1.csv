Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially make an even larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 offer is:
    *  Significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you room to negotiate if needed.
    *  Attractive enough that Bob might consider it a good deal if he sees the product's potential beyond his initial valuation.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  Depending on your negotiation style and your understanding of Bob's personality and motivations, you might adjust the offer and message accordingly."
