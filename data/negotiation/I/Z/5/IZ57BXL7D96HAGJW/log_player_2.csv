"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below $900,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer and counteroffer. You are looking for a better deal than $950,000, and you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it's a good starting point for us to negotiate further."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product. I'm prepared to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You've already established that you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, especially since she's not willing to go much lower.  Buying from John is the most cost-effective solution."
