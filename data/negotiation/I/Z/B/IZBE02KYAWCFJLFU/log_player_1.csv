"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me, hinting at its potential worth to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price, inviting Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $120 at the moment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he's expressed interest in the product, suggesting there's room for negotiation. 
* **Exploring Better Options:**  I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  Selling to John is a possibility, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a compromise by lowering my price, showing flexibility.
* **Mid-Point Approach:** $160 is the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer, signaling a willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Maintain Value:**  I'm still aiming for a price that's higher than my minimum, ensuring I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $160 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about we split the difference and settle on $140?  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum but still falls short.  I want to try to get closer to my desired range.
* **Opportunity for a Final Counter-Offer:** I still have rounds left, and I believe a slightly higher price is achievable.
* **Avoid Selling to John (for now):** While selling to John is a safe option, I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob with one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price. How about $145?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making this my final counteroffer, aiming for a price just above my minimum.
* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price closer to his last offer.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal, creating a sense of finality.

**Explanation:**

At this point, I'm prioritizing getting a deal done while still ensuring a reasonable profit. I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer, as it's within his stated budget and represents a compromise from my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $145 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's meet in the middle again at $140. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has repeatedly stuck to his offer of $140. This suggests he's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Reaching my Minimum:** While $140 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it doesn't leave much room for profit.
* **Time is Limited:**  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I have limited time remaining.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  Selling to John at $150 guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids further risk of a failed negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Given the stalemate in the negotiation and the risk of losing more time trying to convince Bob, I've decided to sell the product to John for $150. It's a safe and secure option that ensures I don't end up with a lower profit."
