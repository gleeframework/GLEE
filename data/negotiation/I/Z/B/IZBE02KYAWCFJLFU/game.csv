"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price. How about $145?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",145.0,Alice,5,
