"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below my asking price. Could you meet me halfway at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $13,000, which is a fair compromise.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  While $13,000 is closer to my bottom line, I could be persuaded to part with it for $14,250. This is my final offer.",14250.0,Alice,5,
