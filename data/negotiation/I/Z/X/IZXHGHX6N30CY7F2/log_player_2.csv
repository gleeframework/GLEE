"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $19,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $19,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  It's always best to try and negotiate for a better price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $19,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below my asking price. Could you meet me halfway at $15,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,500 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $13,000, which is a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  While $13,000 is closer to my bottom line, I could be persuaded to part with it for $14,250. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice's final offer of $14,250 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to budge further.  It's always better to walk away from a deal than to agree to something that you don't feel is fair."
