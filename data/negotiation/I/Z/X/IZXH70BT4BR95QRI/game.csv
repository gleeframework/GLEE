"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the interest in selling me the product. However, I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $14000 for the product?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I can do $14500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",14500.0,Alice,3,
