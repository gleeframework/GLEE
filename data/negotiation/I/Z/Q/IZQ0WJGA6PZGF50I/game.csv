"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for it. Can you consider that?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there on $110. How about $95? It's closer to my budget and I'm sure we can find a happy middle ground.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still not comfortable going as low as $95, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,
