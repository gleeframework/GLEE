Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but you also want to make an offer Bob might accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing somewhere above your minimum.
* **Time Value:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays and secures the deal. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk of going directly to your backup buyer."
