"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's significantly more than your $8,000 limit and leaves no room for negotiation. You should counteroffer with a much lower price to start moving towards a more reasonable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit.  Would you consider $6,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is now negotiating, but $9,000 is still above your maximum budget. You should counteroffer with a price closer to your limit, but leaving some room for further negotiation."

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $7,000. Considering the product's value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm at $8,500, which is above your maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll come down further. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, which is your target price. It's time to cut your losses in this negotiation and go with the guaranteed deal."
