"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $7,000. Considering the product's value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
