,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while staying within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  To be fair, the product's value is substantial and $1,800,000 reflects that. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  I believe this is a more than reasonable compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,500,000 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a significant amount for me. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial limits.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
