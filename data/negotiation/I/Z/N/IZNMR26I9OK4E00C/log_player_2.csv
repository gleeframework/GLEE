"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer of $140 is the best move right now. Here's why:

* **Savings:** You save $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting her offer hoping for a lower price is risky. She might not budge, and you'll end up paying $150 to John. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk overpaying later."
