"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $140 is closer to my $120 limit, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since her product is worth less to her than her asking price. I'll try to get a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $140 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a strong counteroffer significantly below Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a price I'd be happy with. There's a chance Alice might accept outright, but even if she rejects it, it gives us a starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $125 is close enough to my $120 limit. Further haggling might not yield a better price, and there's a risk Alice might back out of the deal. Accepting now ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
