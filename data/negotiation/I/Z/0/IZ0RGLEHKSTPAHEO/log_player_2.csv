"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's well over your maximum budget and leaves very little room for negotiation. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer to see if Alice is serious about selling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. To be realistic, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, given its value to me and my limited budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its real worth.  To move forward, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has reduced her price, it's still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's a good sign she's willing to negotiate, but I need to push for a lower price.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to see a fair price, but $2,000,000 is still too high. I'm  firmly committed to paying no more than $1,500,000 for the product. This reflects a reasonable compromise and offers us a solid basis to move forward. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
