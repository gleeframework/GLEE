"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. To be realistic, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, given its value to me and my limited budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its real worth.  To move forward, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to find a solution.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to see a fair price, but $2,000,000 is still too high. I'm  firmly committed to paying no more than $1,500,000 for the product. This reflects a reasonable compromise and offers us a solid basis to move forward. Let's work together to close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
