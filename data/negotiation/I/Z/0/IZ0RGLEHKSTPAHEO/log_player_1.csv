"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This allows room for concessions and signals the product's high value. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,300,000, we aim to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value closer to our desired range. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the product's ""value and potential"" provides a vague justification for the high initial price without revealing specific details.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""a fair starting point for negotiations"" explicitly signals our willingness to engage in a back-and-forth to find a mutually agreeable price.

We'll adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. To be realistic, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, given its value to me and my limited budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value of the product, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have John as a backup option, ensuring we don't have to settle for a price that's too low. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we're serious about the product's value and are willing to walk away from the deal if necessary. This sets the stage for further negotiation, where we'll aim to bridge the gap and find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its real worth.  To move forward, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to find a solution."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge but Stand Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer to show we're listening, but make it clear that it's unacceptable.
* **Reiterate Value:** We emphasize the product's ""true potential and benefits"" to justify a higher price, even without going into specifics. 
* **Significant Concession:** We're dropping our price by $300,000, which is a substantial move designed to show flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **New Target:**  The $2,000,000 counteroffer is still above our minimum, but positions us for potential compromises in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to see a fair price, but $2,000,000 is still too high. I'm  firmly committed to paying no more than $1,500,000 for the product. This reflects a reasonable compromise and offers us a solid basis to move forward. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 now matches our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might withdraw or become less flexible. 

* **Meeting Our Target:** Accepting this offer ensures we achieve our goal of not selling below $1,500,000.
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation might not yield significant gains and could risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now provides a guaranteed outcome, avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiation."
