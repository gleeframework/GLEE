Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by piquing Bob's interest with the idea of an ""exclusive opportunity.""
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces that the product is worth a significant investment.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and you have a backup offer, aiming higher ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation.  You might settle for a price higher than $1,200,000, maximizing your profit. 
* **Clear Call to Action:**  The message ends with a clear invitation for Bob to engage further if he's interested.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and how much risk you're willing to take (losing the sale to get a higher price), you might adjust the offered price."
