"I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $9500? I'm confident this is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. ",9500.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8500?,8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8500 and $9000. How about $8750?,8750.0,Bob,6,
