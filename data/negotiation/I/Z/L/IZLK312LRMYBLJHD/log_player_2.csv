Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $16,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. Considering the value of the product to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you at $15,200. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200.

It's not worth haggling further with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower, and you can get the product for $15,000 from John."
