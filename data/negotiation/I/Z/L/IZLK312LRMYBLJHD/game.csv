"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $16,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $16,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $14,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and seems like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. Considering the value of the product to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you at $15,200. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",15200.0,Alice,5,
