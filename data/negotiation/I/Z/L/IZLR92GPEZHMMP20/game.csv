,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate it, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $135 for it. What do you think?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $165?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $165 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us both happy.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you at $160, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",160.0,Alice,5,
