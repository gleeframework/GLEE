"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000.  This would be a good deal for me while still recognizing the value of your product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $9,000 is still not enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. I'm counteroffering at $16,000, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
