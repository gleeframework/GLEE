Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I value it highly, but I believe its true worth will be realized in your capable hands. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000} 
 
I, as Alice, am starting with a high initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure the highest possible profit.  My message is framed positively to encourage Bob's engagement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. While I want to secure a deal, accepting such a low offer would mean a substantial loss. I need to counter in a way that brings the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below my bottom line. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  I believe this price reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm making a significant counteroffer to signal that I'm serious about negotiating a fair deal, but not willing to accept a lowball offer. By moving closer to the middle ground, I'm aiming to keep Bob engaged while still pushing for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for more, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting his ""final offer"" ensures I get a good price and avoids the potential loss of selling to John at the same amount."
