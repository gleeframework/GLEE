Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $1,200,000, and this offer is significantly higher.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's space for him to counter without you feeling pressured to sell for less.
* **It shows you're serious:** A high initial offer demonstrates your confidence in the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you initially offered.  Since Bob clearly values the product higher than this, it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows you're willing to meet him halfway, but still maintains a price closer to your desired target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer is close to the middle ground we've established. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or even losing the deal completely.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale that's still above my minimum and within a reasonable range."
