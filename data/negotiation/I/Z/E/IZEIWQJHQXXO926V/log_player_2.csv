"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price that's fair to both of us.  I believe it's worth $9,500 to you, considering its value.  This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a price that's above my minimum.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity to negotiate a lower price or ultimately buy from John and save money."
