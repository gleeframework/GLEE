"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
