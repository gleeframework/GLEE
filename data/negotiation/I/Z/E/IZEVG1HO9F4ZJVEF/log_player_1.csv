Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know Bob would be willing to pay. This gives me some room to negotiate down.
* **Not Too High:** I'm not starting at a ridiculous price, like $150, because that would immediately turn Bob off. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message might make Bob more inclined to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good deal!
* If Bob rejects, I'll see what counteroffer he makes. If it's too low, I'll counter with a lower price, but still above my $150 minimum. 
* If the negotiations drag on or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always accept John's offer for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $90? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:**  $90 is far below my minimum price of $150 and significantly lower than my initial offer of $130.
* **Negotiation:** I believe there is room for negotiation. I can counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. 
* **John is an Option:**  If the negotiations with Bob go nowhere, I can always go with John's offer for $150. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $90 but lower than $130. This will allow for further negotiation while still ensuring I get a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Fair Price:** $110 is still above my minimum of $150 and a reasonable price for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept:** If Bob accepts, we've reached a good deal!
* **Reject and Counter:** If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject it.
* **John's Offer:** If negotiations with Bob stall, I have the option to go with John's offer for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go over $100.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $100 is still below my minimum of $150. 
* **Further Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup if negotiations with Bob don't work out. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $100 but lower than $110, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Reasonable Price:**  $105 is still above my minimum price of $150, so I'm still getting a good deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept:** If Bob accepts, we've reached an agreement! 
* **Reject:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to seriously consider accepting John's offer for $150, as we're getting close to my minimum price and further negotiation might not be fruitful."
