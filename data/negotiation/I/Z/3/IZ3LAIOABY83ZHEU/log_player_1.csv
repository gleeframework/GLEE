"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in your product, but my budget for this purchase is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not desperate to sell and have a backup option with John, so I'm willing to keep negotiating to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. I'm hoping we can find common ground and reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still not enough. I have a backup option with John, and I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob. I'll continue negotiating to try to get closer to my target price."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm still limited by my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that this product will be worth the investment for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still not enough. I have a backup option with John, and I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob. We're getting closer, but I'm not going to settle just yet. I'll continue negotiating to try to get closer to my target price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $940,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still working with a tight budget.  I'm willing to go up to $930,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  I'm hoping this is a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal.  I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for me, and I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are running out of time, and the gap between our offers is narrowing. However, Bob's offer of $930,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It is also unlikely that Bob will meet my counteroffer in the remaining rounds. Therefore, it is more beneficial to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which guarantees my minimum desired profit."
