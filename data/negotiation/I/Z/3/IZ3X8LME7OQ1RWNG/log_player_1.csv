Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

We're still losing a significant amount compared to John's offer.  We need to push back a bit more to see if Bob is willing to budge further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to move significantly closer to our acceptable price.  It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer for $1,200,000.  While we could continue negotiating with Bob, we risk leaving money on the table if we can't reach a deal."
