"Alice, $150 is too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $120. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $100. If that doesn't work for you, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $120. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $115. I think this is a reasonable compromise.",115.0,Alice,5,
