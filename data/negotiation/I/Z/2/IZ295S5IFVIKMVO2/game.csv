"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,000,000.  This way, we both get a fair deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $975,000. This would give you a great deal, and it's a price I can live with. Let's finalize this and get the deal done.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",960000.0,Bob,6,
