"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's priced at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? This price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
