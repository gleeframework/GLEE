"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio, potentially even more so than my initial assessment.  To make this a swift and mutually beneficial transaction, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price range of $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can negotiate further with Alice or move on to John, potentially securing a better deal."
