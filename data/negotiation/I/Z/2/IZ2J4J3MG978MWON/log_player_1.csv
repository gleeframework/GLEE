"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, potentially even more so than I initially estimated. I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming high to establish a strong position. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate downwards.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is designed to be engaging and gauge Bob's initial reaction. His response will give us insights into his willingness to negotiate and how aggressively we can proceed. 
* **Safety Net (John):**  We have the security of John's $800,000 offer. This allows us to be assertive in our negotiations with Bob, as we have a guaranteed minimum sale price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both our minimum price ($800,000) and his perceived value ($1,000,000). It seems he's employing a common negotiation tactic of starting very low. We need to show him we're serious about getting a fair price. We will reject this offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value to both of us.  To move this forward, I can come down to $900,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're holding firm by making a relatively small concession from our initial offer. This signals that we're serious about our valuation but open to negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reminding Bob of the product's inherent value, justifying our price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** We are still above our guaranteed sale price with John ($800,000), giving us leverage. We want to see if Bob is willing to move significantly closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need a price that works for my budget. Would you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer! Bob has increased his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still below our safety net of $800,000 from John. We need to incentivize Bob to move closer to our desired range while demonstrating we're willing to find a middle ground. Rejecting this offer and providing a counter-offer in the next round will help achieve this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This reflects my understanding of the value you place on the product while still acknowledging the significant worth it holds for me.  Do we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** We're making a substantial move by dropping $25,000 from our last offer. This signals our willingness to close the deal.
* **Middle Ground:** $875,000 is a strong compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's last offer ($750,000) and our previous counter ($900,000). 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message implies we're close to a deal, encouraging Bob to respond positively and preventing the negotiation from stalling.
* **Above Safety Net:**  We're still comfortably above John's $800,000 offer, preserving our leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $800,000? That feels like a fair price to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 matches our safety net price from John. While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob could walk away.  Accepting this offer guarantees us a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
