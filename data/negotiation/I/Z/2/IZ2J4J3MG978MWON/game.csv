"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, potentially even more so than I initially estimated. I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value to both of us.  To move this forward, I can come down to $900,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need a price that works for my budget. Would you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This reflects my understanding of the value you place on the product while still acknowledging the significant worth it holds for me.  Do we have a deal?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $800,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",800000.0,Bob,6,
