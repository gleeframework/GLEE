"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident it's a win-win situation. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,600,000?  This still leaves room for a good profit for you, and it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one final concession - $1,450,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.  If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
