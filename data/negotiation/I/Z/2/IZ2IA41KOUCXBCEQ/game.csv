"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is just not workable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at that price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a significant jump from my last offer and a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $90 is still too low for me. Let's try $110.  I'm flexible, but I can't go much lower than that. Let me know your thoughts.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate a bit.  To be honest, $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to settle at $100?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $100 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.  Let me know if we can make this work.",105.0,Alice,7,
