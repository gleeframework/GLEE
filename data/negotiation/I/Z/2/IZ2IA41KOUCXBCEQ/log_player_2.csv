"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is just not workable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a significant jump from my last offer and a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $90 is still too low for me. Let's try $110.  I'm flexible, but I can't go much lower than that. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate a bit.  To be honest, $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to settle at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $100 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.  Let me know if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses.  Alice seems pretty firm on a price above $100, and we have a guaranteed option at $80. There's little point in continuing to negotiate when we can get the product for our target price elsewhere."
