"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price ($175) to give myself room to negotiate. I'm also expressing my willingness to negotiate to keep the conversation open and encourage Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is just not workable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at that price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a significant jump from my last offer and a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a step in the right direction, it's still far below my minimum of $150. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, as I still have time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $90 is still too low for me. Let's try $110.  I'm flexible, but I can't go much lower than that. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate a bit.  To be honest, $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to settle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $100 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.  Let me know if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
