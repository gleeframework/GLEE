**Reasoning:**

Bob has come back to his previous offer of $920,000. While we'd ideally like more, it's a significant profit above our minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks him lowering his offer further or us being forced to accept John's offer of $800,000. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing out."
