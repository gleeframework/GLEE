Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This is a risky strategy, but it has the potential for a big payoff.  Here's why:

* **High Offer:** By offering $1,500,000, I'm aiming for a significant profit beyond John's offer.
* **Potential for a Deal:** If Bob values the product at more than $1,500,000, he's likely to accept.
* **Worst Case Scenario:** If Bob rejects, I still have John's offer of $1,000,000, which is more than the minimum I'm willing to accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Knowing Bob:**  Without any information about Bob's financial situation or the value he places on the product, this high offer is a gamble.
* **Negotiation:**  I could have offered a lower price to start, and then negotiate with Bob if he rejects the initial offer. However, with John's offer as a safety net, I'm taking a more aggressive approach."
