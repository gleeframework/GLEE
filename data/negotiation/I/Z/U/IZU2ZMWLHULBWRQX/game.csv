"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. This product has a lot of value that I believe would greatly benefit you. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I agree it's a good product, $11,500 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could you do $10,200? I think that's a fair price.",10200.0,Bob,4,
