"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could be really valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  I'll reject and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Showing Interest:**  While I'm countering low, I want to assure Alice I'm serious and interested in finding a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. This product has a lot of value that I believe would greatly benefit you. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $11,500 is still too high. We're making progress, so I'll reject and continue negotiating. I want to aim for something closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I agree it's a good product, $11,500 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could you do $10,200? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 10200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:**  Instead of a large jump, I'm making a smaller increase to $10,200.  This shows I'm willing to move towards her price, but I'm still aiming for a good deal.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating that the previous price was too high without being overly negative.
* **Time Constraint:**  I'm aware that we have limited rounds, so I'm trying to nudge the price closer to an acceptable range quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're right that it's a good product, it's exceptional! I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need a price that reflects its true value. How about $10,800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close! Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like. I'll reject again and propose a price closer to my target, hoping she'll meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and make it $10,500? That's a price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's fair for both of us."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $10,500, I'm meeting Alice directly in the middle of our last two offers. This is often seen as a fair compromise in negotiations.
* **Expressing Comfort:** I want to signal to Alice that I'm ready to close the deal at this price, hoping she'll see it as a reasonable solution and avoid dragging the negotiation further.
* **Time Awareness:** We're past the halfway point in the rounds. While I'm not in a rush, I want to increase the chances of a successful negotiation with Alice."
