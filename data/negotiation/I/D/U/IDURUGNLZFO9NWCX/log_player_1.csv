Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
