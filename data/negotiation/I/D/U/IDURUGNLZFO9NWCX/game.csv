"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. However, I do need to make a profit, so I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a significant discount from my original price, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
