It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still within my budget and a good deal compared to John's price. It's worth accepting to save time and effort on further negotiation."
