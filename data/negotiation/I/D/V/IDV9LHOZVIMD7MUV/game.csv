"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than that, especially given its unique features. Would you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're committed to the value of the product, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another seller.",10000.0,Bob,6,
