"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the value it brings while remaining fair to both of us. What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while acknowledging its value.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
