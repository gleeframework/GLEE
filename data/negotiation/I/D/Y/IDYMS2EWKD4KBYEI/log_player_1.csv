Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it holds tremendous value for you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. My initial offer is $1,000,000.  I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've offered $1,000,000, which is a good starting point, considering Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to engage in negotiations. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I've indicated my willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has some leverage.
* **Plan B:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $800,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $900000. This would still be a great deal for both of us, allowing you a substantial profit and me a significant saving.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $800,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, considering Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000, reflecting a significant discount for you.  This would be a fair price for both of us, ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a lower price:** I've lowered my price from $1,000,000 to $950,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on fairness:** I've emphasized that the new price is a ""fair"" one for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
