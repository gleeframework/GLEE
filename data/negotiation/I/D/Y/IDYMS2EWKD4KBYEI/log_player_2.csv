"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it holds tremendous value for you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. My initial offer is $1000000.  I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $1,200,000.
* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is better than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* However, there is room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $800,000.
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. This would still be a great deal for both of us, allowing you a substantial profit and me a significant saving.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $900000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $950000, reflecting a significant discount for you.  This would be a fair price for both of us, ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still within your budget of $1,200,000. 
* This is a significantly better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.
* While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could reject your counteroffer and ultimately you might end up buying from John at a higher price. 
* Accepting Alice's offer secures a good price and allows you to move forward with the purchase."
