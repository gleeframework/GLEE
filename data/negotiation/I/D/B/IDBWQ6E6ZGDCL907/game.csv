"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I'm confident you'll see its worth with continued use.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen.  While $8,500 is low, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant price reduction, reflecting my desire to work with you.  Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value and our ongoing negotiations. Let's see if we can close this deal. ",9500.0,Bob,6,
