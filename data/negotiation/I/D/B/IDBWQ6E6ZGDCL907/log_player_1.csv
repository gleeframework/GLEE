Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value and our ongoing negotiations. Let's see if we can close this deal.

Bob is not showing a willingness to move substantially from his offer. While he has increased it slightly, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's acceptable within the remaining rounds. Taking the guaranteed $12,000 from John is the best decision at this point."
