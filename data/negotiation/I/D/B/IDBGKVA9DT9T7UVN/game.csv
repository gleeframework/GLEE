"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to understanding your perspective on the value and potential price.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is well above what I'm willing to pay. I value this product, but it's not worth $2,200,000 to me. I'm happy to start with a more reasonable offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point given the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While $1,000,000 is a significant starting point, it falls quite a bit short of where I see this deal landing. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects my strong belief in the value this product brings, and I'm hopeful we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's work together to bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  Your commitment to finding a solution is clear, and I respect your willingness to move from your initial offer. To meet you closer to the middle, I'll lower my price to $1,700,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair balance between the product's inherent value and our desire to make this deal happen.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer to a deal, but $1,700,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.  It's a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's value and our need to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
