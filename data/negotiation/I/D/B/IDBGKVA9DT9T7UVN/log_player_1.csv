Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is well above what I'm willing to pay. I value this product, but it's not worth $2,200,000 to me. I'm happy to start with a more reasonable offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point given the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While $1,000,000 is a significant starting point, it falls quite a bit short of where I see this deal landing. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects my strong belief in the value this product brings, and I'm hopeful we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's work together to bridge the gap.

{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  Your commitment to finding a solution is clear, and I respect your willingness to move from your initial offer.

I believe this price point reflects a fair balance between the product's inherent value and our desire to make this deal happen."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer to a deal, but $1,700,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.  It's a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's value and our need to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the increments are too small and the pace is too slow. We're at round 6, and his offer is still significantly below John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  It's unlikely Bob will reach a price that justifies continuing the negotiation at the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
