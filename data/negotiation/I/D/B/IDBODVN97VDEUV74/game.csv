"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $7,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $7,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirements. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7250.0,Alice,5,
