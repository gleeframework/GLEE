Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still lower than the product's worth to Bob. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a good profit.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise, which could make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not under extreme pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
