Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Leaving Room:** By offering $12,500, I have room to negotiate down if needed, while still making a substantial profit.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while also allowing for flexibility in case Bob counters."
