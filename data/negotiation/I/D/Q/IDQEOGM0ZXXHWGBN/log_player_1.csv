"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. It's a price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value of the product ($8,000). This means there's room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and try to secure a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $8,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one last concession.  $8,750 is my final offer.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your last concession, but I'm afraid I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at this price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has consistently stuck to his initial offer of $8,000.  I've made concessions, but it's clear he won't budge.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal, I'll take John's offer of $10,000, which is much closer to my desired price and guarantees a more favorable outcome."
