"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than my true maximum ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Leaving Room:**  By starting low, I signal to Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal and that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Avoiding John Too Soon:** While I have the option to go to John, there's still potential to get a better price from Alice. It's too early to settle for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I understand it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, she's still asking for more than my maximum. There's room to negotiate further.
* **Close to John's Price:**  At $11,000, Alice's offer is getting close to John's price of $10,000.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see how low Alice is willing to go before considering John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort.  How about we settle at $9,000? That would work well for me."", ""product_price"": 9000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  I'm aiming to split the difference between her current offer ($11,000) and my previous offer ($8,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards my target price.
* **Staying Competitive:** At $9,000, I'm still offering a price that's potentially attractive to Alice while leaving me some room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Nearing the Endgame:** I'm getting close to my limit. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely move on to John to avoid overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I'm still a bit above my minimum value of $12,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is at her Limit:** Alice has explicitly stated that $10,500 is the lowest she'll go.  
* **John is Cheaper:**  John offers the product for $10,000, which is a better deal than Alice's final offer.
* **No Guarantee of Further Negotiation:** Even if I counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will budge, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at the lower price. 

At this point, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $500."
