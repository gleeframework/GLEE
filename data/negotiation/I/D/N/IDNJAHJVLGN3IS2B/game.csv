"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offers and go for $887,500. This is a fair compromise, and it's a price I believe we can both be happy with.  Let's make this happen.",887500.0,Alice,5,
