Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation is helpful, starting with a price closer to your own value maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, which can make him feel more in control of the deal. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers (""before I make it available to anyone else"")  can encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price slightly during negotiations, but remember your bottom line is $1,200,000 (since John is a guaranteed sale)."
