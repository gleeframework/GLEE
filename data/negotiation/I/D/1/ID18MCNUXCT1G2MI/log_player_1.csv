Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you. I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to start higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value without being overly aggressive, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer doesn't have to be a ""take it or leave it"" situation.  If Bob counters, you can still negotiate down towards your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a price he might find reasonable."
