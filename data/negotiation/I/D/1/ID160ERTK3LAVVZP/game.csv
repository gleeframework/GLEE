"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750000 is simply too low.  The product is worth $800000 to you, and I'm sure you can see the value in that.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $825000? That's a fair compromise and a good opportunity for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is the price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
