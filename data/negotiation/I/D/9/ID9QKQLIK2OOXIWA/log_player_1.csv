Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far too high.  While I recognize the value of this product, my budget is significantly lower than that. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a fair price given my needs and the market value.  I believe this is a good starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
