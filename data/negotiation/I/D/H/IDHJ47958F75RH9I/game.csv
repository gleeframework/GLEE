"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would you be able to lower the price to meet my budget?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000,  which is still a good price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10,500. This would allow us to reach an agreement that is fair for both parties.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $10,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Would you be willing to go up to $11,250? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
