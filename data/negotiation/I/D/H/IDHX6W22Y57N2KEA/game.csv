"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to be within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
