"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Since Alice's offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and John is also selling for that price, I'll go with John to avoid any further negotiation."
