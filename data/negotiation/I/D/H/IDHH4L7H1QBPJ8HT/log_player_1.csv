Round 8

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my target, and I'm getting a little nervous about running out of time. I'm also worried that if I push for a higher price, I might lose Bob as a buyer and be left with only John's $1,000,000 offer.  This is a good deal, and it's better to secure the sale than risk losing both potential buyers."
