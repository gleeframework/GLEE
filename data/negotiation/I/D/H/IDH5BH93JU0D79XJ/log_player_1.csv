Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good idea to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price above your baseline. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you know he's interested but wants a better deal.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a safety net with John, who's willing to pay $15,000. This knowledge allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob."
