,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to sell it to you for $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for you to get rid of the product.",120.0,Bob,6,
