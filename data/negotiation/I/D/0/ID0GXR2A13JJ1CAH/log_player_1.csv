Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Being Friendly:** Using a friendly tone and asking for Bob's opinion makes the offer feel less aggressive and encourages further conversation.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept, reject, or counter with a new offer.
* **If the negotiation stalls:** I'll keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $150 for this item. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price of $150. There's no need to risk further negotiation.
* **No time wasted:**  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids potential delays or a breakdown in negotiations.
* **Potential for better options:** While I could try to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, the risk isn't worth it. I have John as a backup option if I need to sell quickly or find a better offer in the future."
