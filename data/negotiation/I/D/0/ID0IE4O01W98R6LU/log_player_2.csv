"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. My initial offer for the product is $11,500. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who is willing to make a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. I should try to negotiate a lower price before considering her offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $11,500 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing, but would you consider a price closer to $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than your initial estimate, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on it in your initial message. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from her value. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,250. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point. I'll make one more counteroffer that's slightly better for her, but if she rejects it, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand where you're coming from. Let's make this simple: $10,750, and we have a deal. This offer is my bottom line."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I've been flexible, and I think this is the lowest price I can offer. If you're willing to meet me at $11,000, I'm willing to consider it, but I need to be honest with you, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has returned to her initial offer and doesn't seem willing to budge below $11,000. It's not worth further negotiation. Buying from John for $12,000 is the best option now, as it avoids further haggling and potential price increases from Alice."
