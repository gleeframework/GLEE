"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you know you can buy the product from John for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer.  Rejecting allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Offering $75 is a significant discount from Alice's original price, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** It's important to leave room for Alice to counter without immediately going to John. 
* **Value Unknown:** As we don't know the value of the product to Alice, there's a chance she might accept a lower price to get rid of it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Alice has moved closer to your offer, and $85 is a good price for you considering you are willing to pay $100 to John. 
* **Saving Money:** You're saving $15 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's always the risk that further negotiation could result in a lower price, but it's also possible that Alice won't budge further."
