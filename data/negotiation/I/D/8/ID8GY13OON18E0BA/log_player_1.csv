Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still leaving potential for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is above my minimum acceptable price, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't leave much room for profit.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 85}
