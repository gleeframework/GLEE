I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get more. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I'm still hoping for a higher price, the negotiation with Bob seems to be stuck, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale. John's offer is more than enough to meet my minimum price, so I'll take it."
