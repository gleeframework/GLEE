"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $10,500 is still too low for me. How about $11,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. That's a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal!",11250.0,Alice,5,
