"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that would be highly valuable to your business, and I'm confident it would bring you a significant return on investment. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'd like to reject the offer. Alice is asking for $12,000, but I can get the same product from John for $15,000, so it's not a good deal for me.
