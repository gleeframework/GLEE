"I understand that the product is unique, but I still think $725000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $700000. I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm excited about the possibility of buying this product from you.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700000.

Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",715000.0,Alice,5,
