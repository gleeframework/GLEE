"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe it will be a great asset for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, and I can then adjust my price downwards.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting the value of the product might make Bob more inclined to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $800,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have 8 rounds remaining, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate a more favorable price. 
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not under immense pressure to accept Bob's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price. I'll need to consider factors like the remaining rounds and Bob's apparent willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but my product is truly exceptional. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This allows me some flexibility while still being within a reasonable range for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($800,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a significant profit.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""exceptional"" nature of the product to remind Bob of its value and potential.
* **Emphasizing ""common ground"":**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to find a solution that benefits both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to analyze Bob's response carefully. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll need to consider another counteroffer, taking into account the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my current budget, I would like to propose a price of $900,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We have 6 rounds remaining, providing more opportunities to find a better deal.
* **John is a safe alternative:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, giving me leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll factor in Bob's increasing willingness to pay and the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  Given the value of this product and our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise, big impact:**  I'm making a relatively small concession ($25,000) from my previous offer, but it brings the price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on ""fair compromise"":**  This framing suggests that I'm willing to negotiate reasonably but still holds a firm stance.
* **Time pressure:**  With 5 rounds remaining, I need to start pushing for a deal that's closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider my options. I might need to make a more significant concession to close the deal with Bob, or I might decide to sell to John to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I've reviewed my budget again and am willing to increase my offer to $925,000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my financial limits. I hope this revised proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is still viable:** We have 4 rounds left, which is enough time to try and get a better deal, especially considering John is still an option.
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 allows me to be more firm in my negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,000,000, aiming to secure a deal that's more beneficial to me. However, I'll also be mindful of the remaining rounds and Bob's clear financial constraints."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is getting closer, I'm still a bit short of my target. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to secure a reasonable profit and ensures you get a valuable asset.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession, but firm stance:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous offer ($975,000) but still above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This shows flexibility but also that I am not desperate for a deal.
* **Emphasis on value and fairness:** I highlight the value of the product and frame the offer as a fair compromise. This makes the deal more appealing to Bob. 
* **Focus on reaching agreement:** I explicitly mention wanting to ""finally reach an agreement."" This subtly emphasizes the time constraint and encourages Bob to make a final decision.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a deal that's within my acceptable range.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the remaining rounds and Bob's responses to decide if I should make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've carefully considered my budget and am willing to increase my offer to $935,000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my financial limits. I hope this revised proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We only have two rounds remaining, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **No guarantee of success:** There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and I risk ending up with a less desirable price if I keep negotiating.
* **John is the safe bet:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This ensures I don't lose out on a potentially better deal.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of failing to reach an agreement and potentially getting a lower price is too high. Selling to John is the safest option to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
