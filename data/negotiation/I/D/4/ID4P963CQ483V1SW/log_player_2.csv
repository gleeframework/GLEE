Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  However, I can't accept less than $850,000 for this product. It's a final offer - I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has given a ""final offer"" of $850,000. While this is closer to your budget, you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice if you are not willing to pay above John's price."
