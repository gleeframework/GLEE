``` 

This offer is a starting point. I am starting at a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm motivated to make a deal, $1,050,000 is too far below my minimum. I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a good profit while ensuring you get a fair deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. I've lowered my price to $1,150,000, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. I've included a positive message emphasizing mutual benefit to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still slightly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering I'm right at my limit.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, $1,100,000 is still a significant amount of money.  Further negotiation might lead to a better price, but it risks the possibility of Bob backing out entirely or me losing time and having to sell to John at a lower profit.  I'm confident that I can make a good profit with this offer, and it's important to secure a deal."
