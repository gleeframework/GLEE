"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a good profit while ensuring you get a fair deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still slightly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering I'm right at my limit.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
