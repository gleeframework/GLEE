"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. Let me know your thoughts.

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a good profit while ensuring you get a fair deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.  It's also worth noting that Bob can always purchase the product from John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
