"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to her.  You have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and explore a lower price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Considering the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we settle at $1,050,000? This price would allow both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the immense value of this product. Let's close this deal - I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and although it's still higher than what you initially wanted, it's a fair price considering the product's value and Alice's willingness to negotiate. You have 5 rounds remaining, but there's a high probability that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable cost without risking losing it to John or spending more time negotiating."
