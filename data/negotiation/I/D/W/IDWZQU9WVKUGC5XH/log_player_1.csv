Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for no less than $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($95) gives you a high chance of making the sale while maximizing your profit.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price Bob is likely to accept and a price that yields a significant profit for you."
