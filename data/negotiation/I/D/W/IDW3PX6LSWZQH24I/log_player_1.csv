Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. I'm proposing a price of $15,000. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have room to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $15,000 allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. You can then gradually reduce the price, aiming for a final sale price above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's value to Bob, consider his personality and negotiation style. If he's known to be price-sensitive, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower.
* **Market Conditions:** If similar products are readily available at lower prices, you might need to be more competitive.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
