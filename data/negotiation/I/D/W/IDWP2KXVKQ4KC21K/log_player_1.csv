"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, implying that I'm open to negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied with the initial price. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
