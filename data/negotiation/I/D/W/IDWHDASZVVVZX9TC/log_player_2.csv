# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am excited to present our premier product, which I believe could significantly enhance the efficiency and profitability of your business. Given its unique features and capabilities, I estimate its value to be well above $1200000. However, to facilitate a fair transaction, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $1500000. This exceptional opportunity comes with a comprehensive warranty and dedicated customer support to ensure a smooth integration into your operations.

Please consider this offer carefully. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am looking forward to the possibility of working with you and contributing to the growth of your company.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. Alice's estimated value of the product is $1,200,000, but she's selling it to me for $1,500,000. That's a 25% markup. I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal.
