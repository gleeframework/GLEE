"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. This product has been meticulously designed to meet your specific needs and expectations. I am confident it will exceed your expectations in terms of quality, efficiency, and value. I am offering this exceptional product to you for $12000. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $12,000 and Alice is offering the product for $12,000, there's no room for negotiation. It's better to go with the sure thing and buy from John for the same price. There's no upside to negotiating with Alice, as you're unlikely to get a lower price."
