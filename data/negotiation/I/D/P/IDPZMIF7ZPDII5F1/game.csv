"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to meet you at $15000, which is my absolute maximum. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer. ",15000.0,Bob,4,
