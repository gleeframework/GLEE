Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer for now.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I want to see if I can push him higher in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $1,600,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 as a compromise.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

Round 4

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I value your interest in the product and I'm willing to go down to $1,675,000.  This is a very fair offer given the product's unique features.  Let's finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1675000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my assessment and considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1660000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,660,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,660,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me, and it's likely that Bob won't go any higher.  While I would love to get more, I'm comfortable accepting this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of going back and forth with Bob or selling to John for less."
