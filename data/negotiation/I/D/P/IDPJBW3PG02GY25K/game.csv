,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,250, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle on this.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",7900.0,Bob,6,
