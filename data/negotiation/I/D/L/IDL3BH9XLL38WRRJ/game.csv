Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.,15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I have to say that $12500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13750. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $13500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and my original price of $15000. I'll offer you $13750. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13750.0,Alice,9,
