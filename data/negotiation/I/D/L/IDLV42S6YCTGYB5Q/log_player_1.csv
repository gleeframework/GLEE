Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair price for the product. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This price is fair for both of us, considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can push for a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
