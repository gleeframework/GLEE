"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,200,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's worth $1,000,000 to her, it's above your budget. You should aim to negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair price for the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your budget and your target price. While it's better than her first offer, it's still not a good deal for you. You can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This price is fair for both of us, considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 still isn't quite there for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for this product, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly what John is selling the product for. This means you're not saving any money by continuing to negotiate with Alice. It's a good deal for you, as you are buying the product at your desired price."
