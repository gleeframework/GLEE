"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. $110 is still higher than your maximum value of $120, and you can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal at $112.50. What do you think?

You should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than your maximum value of $120. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering again."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm really interested in the product and think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go above $112. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a deal at $111.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $111.5 is still above your maximum value of $120. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower, and you risk wasting time and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John."
