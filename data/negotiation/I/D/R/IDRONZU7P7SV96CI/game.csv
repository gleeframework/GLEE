"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $110 is a little above my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal at $112.50. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm really interested in the product and think this price is fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go above $112. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a deal at $111.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",111.5,Alice,5,
