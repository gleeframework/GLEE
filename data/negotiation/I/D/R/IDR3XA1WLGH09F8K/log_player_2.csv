"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is close to your limit, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your goal of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's close this deal!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to your goal, you are still within your negotiation range. Rejecting this offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price. There's still room for Alice to come down further, and you might be able to reach your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $107 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 107}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a mutually agreeable price. While $107 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that figure. How about we split the difference and go with $108? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is offering $108, which is only $8 more than your ideal price of $100.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John for $100 anyway.  You've achieved a reasonable price and secured the product."
