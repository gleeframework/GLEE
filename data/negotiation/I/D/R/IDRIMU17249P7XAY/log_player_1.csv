Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

I will accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,550,000 is a good deal considering the limited number of rounds remaining. It's also higher than what I would get from John."
