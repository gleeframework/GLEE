"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  This price is well above the product's worth to me, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is better than my minimum, but it's still not a great deal for me. I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I have 8 rounds left and John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to come down a bit from my initial offer, but still aim for a healthy profit. $1,400,000 is a fair compromise, and hopefully Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm aiming for.  While I'd love to squeeze out a bit more, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $1,350,000 is a good profit for me, and I'd rather take it than gamble with John."
