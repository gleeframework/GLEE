Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it's worth $95 for you. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is fair considering its worth to me.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
