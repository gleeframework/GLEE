"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you accept this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is your maximum offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
