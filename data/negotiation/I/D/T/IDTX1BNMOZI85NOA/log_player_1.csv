Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $10000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle for that price.  I believe I can still push for a better price, and I'll continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 is too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000. Would you consider $10250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get more, Bob's offer of $10,250 is close to my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to accept this offer than risk getting less or having to sell to John for the minimum price."
