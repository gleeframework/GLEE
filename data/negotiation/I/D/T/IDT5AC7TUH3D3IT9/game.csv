"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too far below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
