"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is highly valued by its users. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, we believe it is worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true value and the benefits it offers, I am extending this exclusive opportunity to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's much closer to her own valuation than mine. I should counter-offer with a price closer to my budget, hoping to find a middle ground throughout the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks excellent, that price is a little too high for me.  Could we agree on a price closer to $650,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 650000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with a proposal of $750,000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the value you see in the product and our valuation. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $750,000 is still too high. It's likely we can negotiate a better price by continuing to counter-offer. I'll aim slightly higher than the midpoint between our last offers."

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but we're still not there yet. I'll continue to push for a lower price, as we still have room to negotiate before hitting John's price."
