"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value asset that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to start our negotiation. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us. ",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,250,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  While I'm tempted to take your offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This is a fair price, and if we can agree, I'm ready to move forward.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to account for the value I've added to the product. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,295,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1295000.0,Alice,7,
