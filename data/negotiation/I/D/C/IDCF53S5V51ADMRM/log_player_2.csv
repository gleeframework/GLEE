"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value asset that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to start our negotiation. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a good starting point to reject Alice's offer. $1,500,000 is way above your budget, and you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$1,350,000 is still above your budget, so it's best to continue negotiating.  You can try to meet Alice in the middle again with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,250,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than you want to pay.  You can try to get closer to your target with a counteroffer.  You are getting closer to John's price, so this is a risky negotiation.  Keep in mind you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close.  While I'm tempted to take your offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This is a fair price, and if we can agree, I'm ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to account for the value I've added to the product. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,295,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,295,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You are very close to agreeing with Alice, but there's no guarantee that she'll accept your next counteroffer. Buying from John is the safer option. You've already gotten the price down significantly, and you are guaranteed to get a great deal. You're just $95,000 over your ideal budget, but that's a small price to pay for certainty."
