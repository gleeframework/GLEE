"I've made it clear that I'm willing to meet you at $840000, and I've even made a few concessions to try to get a deal done. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one final offer of $845000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",845000.0,Alice,9,
