Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (e.g., $250) could make Bob immediately lose interest.  $175 is a reasonable markup that might still be appealing to Bob.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""great deal for the value,"" we subtly imply the product is worth more than the asking price.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, we have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't make less than $150. This strategy aims to potentially earn more than the guaranteed amount."
