Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $1,000,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation, and it's below Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000. 

I'm aiming for a win-win situation where I can get a good price while also maintaining a positive relationship with Bob, which could lead to future business opportunities."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than the price I'm aiming for.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm showing flexibility while staying firm in my desire to get a price closer to my target."
