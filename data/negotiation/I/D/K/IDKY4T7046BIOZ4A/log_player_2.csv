**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's** ($1,150,000 vs $1,200,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  My offer is $100,000 lower than Alice's offer, which is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* **Value difference:** This offer is still significantly higher than Alice's value of $1,000,000, leaving room for her to make a profit. 
* **My budget:** This offer keeps me within my budget of $1,200,000."

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation progress:**  Alice has moved closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal without further risk."
