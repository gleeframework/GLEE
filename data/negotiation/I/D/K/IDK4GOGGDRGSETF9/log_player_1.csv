"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high with an offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant amount above my minimum value, giving Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I have a large profit margin. 

Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, this initial high offer allows me to gauge his interest and potential willingness to pay. If he rejects, I can analyze his counteroffer to understand his perceived value and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still significantly above my minimum value of $1,200,000. However, I believe there is room for further negotiation to potentially reach a higher price.  

By rejecting this offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. This will allow me to explore if Bob is truly willing to pay a higher price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit. This allows me to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway and possibly inch closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant amount above my minimum value of $1,200,000 and is close to my previous counteroffer.  I'm comfortable with this price and don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer ensures a strong profit while also securing a sale."
