# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist this offer. What do you think?
