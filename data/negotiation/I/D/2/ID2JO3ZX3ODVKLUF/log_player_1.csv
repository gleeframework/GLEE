It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable Price:**  $1,080,000 is a strong profit, well above our minimum and John's offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely we'll get much higher.
* **Time Value:** We've already secured a good deal, and dragging it out risks losing the sale."
