Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we meet somewhere around $725,000? I believe that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, which indicates he's willing to pay more. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to negotiate further and try to close the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $725,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my initial asking price.  To bridge this, let's settle at $875,000. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would $800,000 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

**Reasoning:** Bob has met John's offer. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better outcome. Accepting now secures the $800,000."
