"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that I believe you'll find very valuable. Considering its worth to me and its potential value to you, I propose a price of $100 for it. This is a great opportunity to get a piece you might really enjoy or benefit from. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $100 is above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $100 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I would like to make a counteroffer at $90 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it while remaining within your budget range. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $90 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point of $80. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to go lower.  There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that point."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To reach an agreement that benefits both of us, I am willing to lower the price to $87 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product and your budget. I hope you find this offer acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87 is getting close to Bob's budget, but he can still do better.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $80, it's worth seeing if he can get Alice to lower the price just a bit more. There are still 5 rounds left, so time is on his side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, I'm still hoping to close the deal for $85. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 85}
