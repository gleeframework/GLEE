"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. He's willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within the range of what he's willing to pay. This gives Alice room to negotiate while also demonstrating Bob's serious interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $11,000 is still above Bob's ideal price. There's still room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer again and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still looking to stay closer to my budget. How about $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm in his negotiation. He's making a counteroffer that is closer to his target price while still being reasonable enough to keep the deal alive. This move demonstrates that he's serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to drop to $10,900 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,900 is very close to Bob's ideal price, he can still potentially save a little more. He's only $900 away from his target price, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to go a bit lower to close the deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to try one more counteroffer before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there! I'm ready to close the deal at $10,800.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is going for a final counteroffer that is only $100 away from his target price.  This shows that he is very serious about buying the product but is still trying to get the best deal. This strategy puts pressure on Alice to accept and close the deal."
