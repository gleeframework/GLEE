Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, $12,500 is still more than he's willing to pay. He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's right at my budget and still gives you a good profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11,750. This is my final offer, as I don't want to go any lower. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $11,750 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  John is offering a price that Bob can afford, and the negotiation with Alice has reached a point where it's unlikely she'll lower her price further."
