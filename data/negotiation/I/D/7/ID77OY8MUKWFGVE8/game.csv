"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your desired selling point and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the absolute limit of my budget.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.  Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
