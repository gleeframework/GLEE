``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, exceeding my minimum value of $800,000. It leaves room for negotiation while also showing confidence in the product's worth.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response, but I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your desired selling point and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum asking price and my starting point.  I'm not willing to accept that.  I need to counter and see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the absolute limit of my budget.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.  Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum asking price, and it aligns with what I would get from John. It's a fair deal, and I'm happy to accept it to close the transaction."
