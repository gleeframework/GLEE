"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit,  I'll offer you the product for $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let's see if we can make this work!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm still feeling a bit off on that price.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  It's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $13,000. It's a good compromise and  a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $13,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $13,500. It's a good price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering we're both making some compromises. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,8,
