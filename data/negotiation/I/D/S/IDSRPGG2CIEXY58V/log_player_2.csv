It's always worth trying to get a better price.  Let's see if we can negotiate with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}

I'm starting with a significant discount to see how Alice reacts.  If she's willing to negotiate, she'll likely come back with a counteroffer.  We'll see if we can land somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $9,000 is still a bit high. Let's see if we can get closer to my initial counteroffer."

Let's meet Alice halfway. $8,000 is a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can close the deal."
