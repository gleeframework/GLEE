"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $15,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $12,000. However, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,750. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $11,750 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to come to a price that's a bit more comfortable for me.  Would you consider $11,250?  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close the deal with this price.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll offer you the product for $12,100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",12100.0,Alice,5,
