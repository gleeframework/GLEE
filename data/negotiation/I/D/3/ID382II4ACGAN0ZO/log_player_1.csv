Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and also shows him that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than my minimum value of $80, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price."
