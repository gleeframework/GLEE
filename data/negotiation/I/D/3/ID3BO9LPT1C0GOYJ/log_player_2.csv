"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget ($15,000 vs. my maximum of $10,000). There's no way I'll accept that. I'll reject and see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is out of my budget. I'm only able to pay $10,000. This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping she'll come down closer to my $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $11,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm now offering the product to you for $12500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  While I'm willing to negotiate, we're getting close to the end of our allotted rounds. I don't want to risk losing the product entirely.  Jhon is offering a guaranteed deal at my maximum price.  I'll go with the sure thing and buy from Jhon."
