"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $750,000. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you.  I could come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we are finding some common ground here.  $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we split the difference at $975,000? That feels like a fair offer to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
