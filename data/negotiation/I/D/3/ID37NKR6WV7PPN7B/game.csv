"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need it to be within a reasonable budget. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me some, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, anything above $750,000 is going to be a hard sell for me. I can offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart in our valuations. I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge the gap, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. My final offer is $1,000,000. This is a very generous offer considering the value this product will bring.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, but that final offer is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's the absolute limit of what I can justify.",700000.0,Bob,6,
