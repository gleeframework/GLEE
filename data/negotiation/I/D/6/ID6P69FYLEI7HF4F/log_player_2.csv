"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your goal is to save money, and you know John will sell you the product for $150, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but there's no guarantee, and you're already sure of getting the product from John."
