"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the immense value it holds."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong opening offer of $1,400,000, closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a favorable deal.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value without revealing our minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This initial offer allows us to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and adjust our strategy accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our target and his perceived value. We have room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're looking for a price closer to our initial proposal. We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle during the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. Let's find a middle ground - would you consider $1,325,000?"",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're aiming for a compromise by suggesting a price exactly halfway between our previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,250,000). 
* **Firm but Fair:** The message maintains a polite and professional tone while reiterating our stance that the product holds substantial value.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By making a counteroffer, we keep the negotiation moving forward and demonstrate our willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,325,000, so my new offer is $1,287,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,287,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,287,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving towards a 50/50 split with each round. While $1,287,500 is tempting, we're still early in the negotiation. Holding our ground for another round or two could lead to a significantly better outcome. We're aiming for at least $1,300,000, and we're prepared to walk away if we can't reach that threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen - how about $1,310,000?  That's me moving closer to your price in the spirit of compromise."",
""product_price"": 1310000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this time ($15,000 instead of $37,500), signaling that we're reaching the upper limit of our flexibility.
* **Encouraging a Deal:** The message emphasizes our willingness to close the deal and frames the price reduction as a gesture of goodwill. 
* **Time Consideration:** With half the rounds remaining, we're applying gentle pressure while leaving room for potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer $1,295,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,295,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is becoming entrenched at the $1,250,000 mark, but he's still engaging in the negotiation. We need to signal that we're nearing our walk-away point. By rejecting this offer, we're applying pressure and testing his resolve. We'll aim for a smaller concession next round to entice him while staying above $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation, and I want to be straightforward.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but that's my absolute best offer.  It's a fantastic price for a product you clearly see value in."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're presenting this as our non-negotiable bottom line, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Appealing to Value:** We're reminding Bob of the product's benefits and aligning it with his initial interest. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only three rounds left, we're making it clear that we're prepared to walk away and potentially accept John's offer. This could motivate Bob to accept or propose a counteroffer very close to our target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,295,000, as I mentioned before. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher than this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,295,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Position:** Bob has consistently remained at or below $1,295,000. It's unlikely he'll go higher. 
* **Limited Time:**  We're down to the wire. Pushing further risks losing Bob without a guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Significant Profit:**  $1,295,000 is a substantial profit, well above our minimum and John's offer.

While we aimed for $1,300,000, securing a deal close to our target in a tough negotiation is a win. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob backing out completely."
