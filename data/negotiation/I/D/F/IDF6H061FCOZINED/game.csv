"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. This is a great deal, as it's well below its true value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $110.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $95. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  $95 is closer, but I need to get at least $100 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That way, we both get a good deal. ",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $97.50, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $99. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",99.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price.  How about we meet at $98. It's a small step for me, and a big one for you to get this deal done.  Let's finish this.",98.0,Bob,8,
