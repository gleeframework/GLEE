"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to me, but I understand its value may be different to you. Would you like to take a look at it? If you're interested, I'll offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price, getting closer to $100.  We will make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This serves two purposes:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A large counter-offer helps us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, we have space to increase our offer gradually and still potentially secure a deal below $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To better accommodate your budget, I'm willing to offer the product for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. While $95 is closer to our ideal price, we are still aiming to get as close to $100 as possible. Let's see if we can get Alice down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:**  We are moving closer to Alice's price in smaller increments, showing her we're serious about purchasing but still looking for a bargain.
* **""Meeting in the middle"":**  This framing suggests fairness and compromise, potentially making Alice more receptive to the offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're still below our maximum budget, giving us some wiggle room if Alice makes a counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're considering my product, Bob. Considering the value you place on it, how does $92 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $92 is a very good price, and we're unlikely to get Alice much lower. It's a significant saving compared to her initial offer and only slightly above our ideal price. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are past the halfway point in the negotiation. While we might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of Alice backing out or the negotiations stalling increases. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk missing out entirely."
