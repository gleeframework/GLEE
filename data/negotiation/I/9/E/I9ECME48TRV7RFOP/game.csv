,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in the product.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
