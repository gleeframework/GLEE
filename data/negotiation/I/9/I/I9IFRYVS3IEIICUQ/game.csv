"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life. I'm confident that you'll find it's worth the investment.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $800000 is closer, I'm still not there yet.  Let's try $750000. This is a reasonable offer that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a significant step closer to my initial offer. I'm confident that we can find common ground at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $825000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. $825000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to meet you at $775000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that we can finalize a deal at this price.  Let's close this deal and get the product in my hands.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000.
