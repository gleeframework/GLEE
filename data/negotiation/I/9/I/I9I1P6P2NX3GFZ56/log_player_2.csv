Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a touch above what I'm comfortable with. How about $1,125,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and puts us closer to the middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1125000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're trying to push the price down further. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $1,250,000. This is my final offer before we reach the lower limit of what I'm comfortable with. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is unlikely to go below her stated limit of $1,250,000. Since you can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $50,000."
