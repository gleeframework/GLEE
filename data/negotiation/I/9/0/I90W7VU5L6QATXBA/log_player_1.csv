Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for Bob, highlighting the perceived value and potential for a good deal.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation down to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** A reasonable starting point keeps Bob interested and open to negotiating.
* **Maintain John as a safety net:**  John's offer of $12,000 provides a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to compromise that much.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I want to find a compromise that allows me to make a profit while still keeping Bob in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to keep the negotiation positive by acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal and emphasizing the win-win aspect of my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that is closer to Bob's perceived value but still significantly above his offer, I aim to:

* **Stay closer to my desired range:** $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Show flexibility:**  My willingness to compromise could encourage Bob to accept my offer.
* **Keep the negotiations going:** A counteroffer keeps the conversation open and avoids the need to sell to John at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not able to go above $8,000 for this product. I hope you can meet me at this price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is insistent on $8,000, which is far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome for me.

**Why sell to John:**

* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer ensures I get my minimum desired value for the product.
* **Avoid further negotiation:** This ends the negotiation process with Bob, saving time and effort.
* **No risk of loss:**  Negotiating with Bob further carries the risk of settling for a price that is too low.

While I would prefer to sell for a higher price, John's offer is the most secure and profitable option at this point."
