"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with our flagship product, which holds immense value for you at $15,000. I am offering you this exceptional opportunity to acquire it at a special introductory price of $12,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a significant saving compared to its market value. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000 and John's offer of $15,000. While it's a ""better"" price than John, you can likely negotiate a better price with Alice or find another seller with a more competitive offer."
