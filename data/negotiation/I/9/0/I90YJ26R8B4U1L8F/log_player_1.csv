"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this truly valuable product. Given its unique nature and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. This leaves us room to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price was based on a realistic assessment of the product's value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000? I'm confident this would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still thinking $1,200,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I need to be convinced it's the best deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his initial offer, which doesn't benefit me. I'll make one more attempt to push the price higher, highlighting the unique value proposition of the product. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but I believe you're undervaluing the potential of this product. It offers unique benefits that go beyond typical market offerings, potentially saving you significant costs and generating new revenue streams in the long run.  To demonstrate my commitment to closing a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm still not convinced that the product's benefits justify a price higher than $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I need to be comfortable with the cost. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly unwilling to move from his $1,200,000 offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the guaranteed offer from John for the same amount. It's time to cut my losses and finalize the sale with John."
