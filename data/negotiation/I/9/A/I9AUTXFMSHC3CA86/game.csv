"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find common ground here.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm still not quite there with $13,500. How about we compromise at $15,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
