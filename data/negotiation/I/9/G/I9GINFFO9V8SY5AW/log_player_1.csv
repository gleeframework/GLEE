{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The Message:** This is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open. By offering a price above Bob's perceived value, I'm creating an incentive for him to negotiate, which could potentially lead to a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my position of power and potentially drive a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, the potential for a higher offer from Bob outweighs the risk of losing the sale altogether."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial price. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:**  This is a counteroffer that is significantly closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, it is still above his offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Message:** The message is polite and reiterates the value proposition of the product, emphasizing the compromise I am making.  

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a compromise that is fair for both parties.  This counteroffer creates a scenario where Bob is likely to feel pressured to accept, considering it's closer to his perceived value and a significant step down from my initial offer. However, it also keeps my profit margin above the minimum acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Even though I'm losing some profit with each negotiation round, I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my position of power and potentially drive a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, the potential for a higher offer from Bob outweighs the risk of losing the sale altogether. 

**Next Step:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our last offers while still remaining above my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is still a little too low for me.  To show you my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is a significant compromise for me, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between our last offers. It's still above my minimum acceptable value but closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the compromise I'm making, highlighting the value proposition and positioning this as a final offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Agreement:** This offer creates a strong incentive for Bob to accept, as it's significantly closer to his last offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I am still holding out for a price above my minimum acceptable value, while also showing flexibility. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While there is a risk of Bob rejecting this offer, the potential reward of securing a sale at $11,000 outweighs the risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of further back-and-forth with Bob is not worth the potential loss of profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Upward Potential:**  It is unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly from $9,500.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, ultimately costing me valuable time and potentially losing the sale altogether.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable value and secures a significant return on my investment.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John at this point offers the most secure and profitable outcome, minimizing risk and ensuring a significant return."
