Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product offers to Bob, hoping to motivate him to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, making it clear that I'm willing to work with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and consider if it's worth pursuing. If it's too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my original price. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll always have John's $15,000 offer as a safety net, providing a floor for my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a higher price than Bob's current offer.
* **John's Offer:**  I have John's guaranteed $15,000 offer, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his $9,000 and my original $12,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would give you a good deal, and still allow me to get a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $10,500 represents a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I emphasize that this price is a ""good deal"" for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation flowing.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer.  If he rejects it, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept John's offer of $15,000. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't settle for a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can we meet at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I might not get a better price.  
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and John's offer is always a viable option.

**Next Steps:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale. 
* **John's Offer:**  While I'm happy with the sale to Bob, I'll keep John's offer in mind for future opportunities."
