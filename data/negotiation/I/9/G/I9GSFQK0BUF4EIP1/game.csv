"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I think $13,000 is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm already meeting you halfway from my initial offer. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",13000.0,Alice,5,
