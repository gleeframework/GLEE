"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $18,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  There's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $12,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly more than what Bob is willing to pay. He can get the product from John for $8,000, making it more logical to reject Alice's offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I think $13,000 is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm already meeting you halfway from my initial offer. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's final offer is still $13,000, which is above Bob's budget.  He's already made his final offer, and Alice has rejected it.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate further, and Bob is better off securing the product from John at a price he can afford."
