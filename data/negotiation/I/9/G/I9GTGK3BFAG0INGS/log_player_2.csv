"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $100. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested in the product, $180 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $100, which is my maximum."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay, it's much closer to my budget and a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer. I'm confident that I can't get a lower price from Alice, and John's offer of $100 is still available if I reject this one.  Therefore, accepting this offer is the best course of action."
