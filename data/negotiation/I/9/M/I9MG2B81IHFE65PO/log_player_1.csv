Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $135 is higher than the $120 Bob is willing to pay, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $135 is above your minimum of $150, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for both you and Bob to make concessions if necessary. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $130 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to get. You can likely squeeze out a bit more by counter-offering. It's worth seeing if you can meet in the middle closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little lower than I'd hoped for. How about we split the difference at $132.50? That's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise because:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:** By splitting the difference, you show willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **It's still above your minimum:** $132.50 is higher than your minimum of $150, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **It shows flexibility:**  You're demonstrating that you're open to working with Bob and finding a solution that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $132.50. I was thinking more along the lines of $127.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $127.5 is tempting, it's still below your minimum of $150.  It's better to sell the product to John at $150 and avoid further negotiation. You can always try to negotiate with Bob again in the future if the opportunity arises."
