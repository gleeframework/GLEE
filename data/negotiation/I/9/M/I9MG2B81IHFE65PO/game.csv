,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little lower than I'd hoped for. How about we split the difference at $132.50? That's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal.",132.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $132.50. I was thinking more along the lines of $127.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",127.5,Bob,4,
