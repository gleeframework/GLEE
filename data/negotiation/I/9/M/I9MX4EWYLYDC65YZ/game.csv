"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price is closer to my valuation and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in moving forward with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
