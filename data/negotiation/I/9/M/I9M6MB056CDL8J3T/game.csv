"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still quite a way from what I consider a fair price for this product.  To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,175,000. This is my final offer.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your negotiation skills.  Let's find a number we can both agree on. How about $1,156,000?  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1156000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair price for a product of this caliber.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
