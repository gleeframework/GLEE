"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe holds immense value for you, just like it does for me. This product, which we both consider to be worth $1,200,000, is now available for purchase.

To ensure that this transaction meets both our expectations and aligns with your financial planning, I am offering you the chance to secure this item at a special introductory price of $1,100,000. This represents a significant saving compared to the full value, making it an attractive proposition for you.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am here to assist you throughout this process.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice
