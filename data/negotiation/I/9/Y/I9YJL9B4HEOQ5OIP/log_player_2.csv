# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $110. Please let me know if this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  You know the product is worth $120 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $120. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet within your budget. I'd like to offer you the product at $107, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value it provides. Please let me know if this offer suits your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $107, which is only $7 more than your initial counteroffer of $100.  Since you're willing to pay up to $120, this is a good deal.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a higher price from John."
