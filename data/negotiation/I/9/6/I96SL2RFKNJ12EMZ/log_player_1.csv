Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, you ""anchor"" the negotiation. Even though it's above both your value and Bob's, it sets a frame of reference.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John offers your minimum acceptable price, securing a deal with Bob above that would be ideal. 

This initial offer is a starting point. How Bob responds will determine your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's, I started negotiations high for a reason. It's unlikely he'll immediately agree to my initial offer. By rejecting his counteroffer, I signal that I believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to negotiate further, but not at a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,450,000?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease:** By dropping $150,000, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Above Both Valuations:** This price still positions the product above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer, aiming for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's seriousness and help determine if further negotiation is worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  While not my initial asking price, $1,300,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating genuine interest. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially losing the sale altogether."
