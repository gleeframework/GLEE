"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. Given that we're both trying to reach an agreement, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's try to make this work.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
