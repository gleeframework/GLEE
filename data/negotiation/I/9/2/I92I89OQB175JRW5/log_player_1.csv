Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not losing money.
* **It's below John's offer:** You leave room to negotiate without losing out on a guaranteed sale.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It shows you're serious about selling, but are also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting allows you to try and get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $105 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still hoping to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $107.5 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what John is offering.  The negotiation process is proving to be a bit of a stalemate.  Since you're guaranteed $120 from John, it's more advantageous to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
