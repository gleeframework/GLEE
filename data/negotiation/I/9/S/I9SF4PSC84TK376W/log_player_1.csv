Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), I aim high to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,200,000 offer leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. This keeps the interaction flexible.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value"" and ""potential"" aims to justify the high price and shift Bob's focus towards the product's benefits.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 from John if Bob rejects the offer. This knowledge allows me to be bolder in my initial offer."
