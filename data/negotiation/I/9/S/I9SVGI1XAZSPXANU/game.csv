"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite steep. This product fits my needs, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
