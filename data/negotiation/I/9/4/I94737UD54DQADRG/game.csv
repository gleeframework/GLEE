"Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product, which is still a fair price given its potential value.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is considerably higher than your initial offer reflects. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant price adjustment and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
