Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum, as the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer to $100. This is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum, and it might be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price,  $92 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John.  There's a risk that Bob could continue to lower his offer, but it's unlikely he'll go much lower, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
