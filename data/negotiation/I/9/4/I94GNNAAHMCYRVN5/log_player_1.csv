Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $110 to make this worthwhile. How about $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to $100 to make this worthwhile. How about $99? "", ""product_price"": 99}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. While Bob's offer of $98 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, I don't have time to continue negotiating with him.  John is offering me a guaranteed $120, which is more than I can get from Bob at this point."
