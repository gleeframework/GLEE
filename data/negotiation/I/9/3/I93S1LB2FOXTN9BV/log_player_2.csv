"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I believe it's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $900000.  This leaves room for us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You're looking to save as much money as possible and $900,000 is still significantly higher than your ideal price point. By rejecting the offer, you can initiate a counteroffer and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to get a better deal. I understand the value of this product, but $900,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000, reflecting a price that's fair for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's opening price.  It signals that you are serious about negotiating a lower price, but it is still within a range that allows Alice to potentially make a profit.  

By offering $750,000, you're also leaving room for potential compromise and counter-offers in the subsequent rounds. This strategy aims to find a middle ground that benefits both parties while maximizing your savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to the value of the product.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $825000. This price is fair for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, $825,000 is still too high. You're aiming to save as much as possible and there's still room for further negotiation. 

Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a better deal. It also demonstrates your commitment to securing a price that aligns with your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This price is fair for both of us and reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing you are willing to meet Alice halfway. It also makes sense financially for you, as it brings you closer to your desired price while still allowing for a potential profit for Alice.  It is a reasonable compromise that allows both parties to save face and move towards a successful deal."
