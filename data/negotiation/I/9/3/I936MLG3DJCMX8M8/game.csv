"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This price is still significantly less than what I could get elsewhere, but allows us both to benefit from the deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and I'm ready to make a final concession.  $8,800 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go to $9,200.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.",9200.0,Alice,5,
