Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $150, you're setting a high anchor point for Bob. Even if he doesn't accept this initial price, his counteroffer might be closer to your desired range than if you started lower.
* **Alternative Option:** You always have John as a backup buyer, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a price below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. By immediately accepting $100, you leave potential profit on the table.  You'll try to nudge him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $150 is my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, how about we settle at $130?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but with a bias):** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate by coming down from your initial price. However, the decrease is not drastic, indicating you still value the product above Bob's initial offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Offering $130 presents a seemingly ""fair"" compromise, which might make Bob more receptive than a smaller reduction. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price point still allows you to secure a decent profit margin while keeping the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $115 is a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains.  It's unlikely Bob will go much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  By holding out for a higher price, you risk Bob walking away entirely, leaving you with John's $100 offer. Accepting $115 now secures a good profit with minimal risk."
