"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Knowing its value in the current market, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is simply out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I believe $1,200,000 reflects a more realistic value for the product.  I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial starting point for negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your initial offer is below what I had in mind, I recognize your serious interest.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000? I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While $1,900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000.  This would represent a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
