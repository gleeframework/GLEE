"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to compromise on the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could we agree on $775,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising the value of the product. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
