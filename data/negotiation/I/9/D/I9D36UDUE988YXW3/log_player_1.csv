Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

I'm not willing to sell the product for $7,500. I'm going to counteroffer Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $7,500, so I'd like to offer $7,750. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $7,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'd rather sell to John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
