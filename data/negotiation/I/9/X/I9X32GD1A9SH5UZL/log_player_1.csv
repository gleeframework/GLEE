Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, starting near that figure makes sense.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning another interested party (John) introduces a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to counter-offer if he's highly motivated, potentially leading to a sale above your $1,000,000 fallback."
