"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120?  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $120 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $90 is still a bit too low. How about we compromise at $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still having a hard time justifying $105. How about $85?  That's a significant compromise on my part.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $95, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,7,
