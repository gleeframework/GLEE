"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm still confident this is a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go down to $10,900, which is a fair compromise and still a great deal for you. I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10800.0,Bob,6,
