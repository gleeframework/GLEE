"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value your product highly.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Knowing that the product is worth $120 to Bob, starting at $110 aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a sense of gaining a deal.
* **Polite and Engaging Tone:** The message is crafted to be friendly and non-confrontational, aiming to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a reasonable profit, we know Bob values the item at $120. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for the possibility of securing a higher price closer to Bob's perceived value. We still have several rounds and the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth more to me than that. Could you meet me halfway at $102?"",
""product_price"": 102
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer suggests a spirit of compromise while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $102 is closer to Bob's perceived value of $120, making it more likely he'll see the value in accepting.  
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  The message reiterates that the product holds value for Alice, justifying the higher counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I think $97 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob increased his offer, signaling he's willing to pay more.  We're still in a strong position and have time to negotiate further. Holding out for a price closer to $100 seems reasonable at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob!  How about we split the difference and call it $100 even?  That's a great deal for a product you'll love."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring to $100:**  By repeatedly mentioning $100, we aim to make it a psychological reference point for Bob. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Phrases like ""getting closer"" and ""great deal"" imply that this offer is time-sensitive and encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer maintains firmness while offering a compromise that seems reasonable on the surface."
