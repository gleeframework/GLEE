# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000, which is a generous offer considering its true value to me is $1,200,000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer is below her stated value, you have a better option available. Buying from John at $800,000 saves you a significant amount of money and still gets you the product."
