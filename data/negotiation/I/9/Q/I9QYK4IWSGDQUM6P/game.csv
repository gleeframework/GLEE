"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given your value for the product is $8,000, how about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to the $15,000 value you place on the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference again and aim for $11,250.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not sure if $11,250 is the right price for me. I'm willing to listen to one more offer, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. How about we try $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000.  Let's try $12,000 one more time.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already offered you a price of $13,000 in round 5, and I'm not willing to go back to $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. How about we try $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting close, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's compromise one last time at $12,750. It's a fair price that's reasonable for both of us, and it gives us a chance to close this deal. What do you say?",12750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up more ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $12,750, which is $13,125. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",13125.0,Alice,9,
