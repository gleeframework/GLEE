**Reasoning:**

Bob is anchored at $950,000 and unwilling to budge. It's unlikely he'll go above $1,000,000, especially with several rounds left. Accepting his offer is a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,000,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome than John's offer."
