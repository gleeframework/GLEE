Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $150, which is a fair price considering its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is quite low for the value this product offers.  Could you meet me halfway at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $105 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit much for me. Would you consider $75? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and settle at $90? That's a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about $80? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to go much higher than $80. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $120, it makes more financial sense to take the sure profit now. Holding out for a potentially slightly higher offer from Bob isn't worth the risk of losing John's offer."
