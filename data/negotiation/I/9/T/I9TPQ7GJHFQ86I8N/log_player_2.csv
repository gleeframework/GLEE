"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still higher than Alice's ideal price point but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal. By offering a specific price and giving a reason, Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and is also setting the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is within Bob's budget and only $500 more than his ideal price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, or Bob may end up paying more from John.  Accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point."
