Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price is not my absolute minimum, so I can still negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Maintaining My Value:**  $12,000 is a good starting point because it's closer to my minimum value of $15,000 than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This increases my chances of getting a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **John as a Backup:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not pressured to accept any offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000.  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's still interested.  There's potential to negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **John provides a safety net:** I know I can sell to John for $15,000, so I can afford to be patient and try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value than his offer.
* **Staying Firm:** My counter-offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for more negotiation if Bob counters again. This approach balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to avoid losing the sale entirely.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm always keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $15,000, which helps me feel confident in holding out for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $10,500 is still below my desired value, it's very close to my minimum of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would be a reasonable compromise.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield much more:** It's unlikely that I can convince Bob to go much higher than $10,500. He's already shown a willingness to meet me halfway.
* **Risk of losing the sale:** If I reject Bob's offer, I run the risk of him walking away entirely.  This would force me to sell to John for $15,000, which is less ideal than the $10,500 offer.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option at this stage of the negotiation."
