Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message hints at its value, making the higher price seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone remains conversational and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or dislikes haggling, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Demand:** While you have John as a backup, gauging the overall demand for your product can help you assess your bargaining power."
