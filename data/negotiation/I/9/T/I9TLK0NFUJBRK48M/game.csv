"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move towards a mutually agreeable price.  To be fair,  I'm willing to consider  $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can justify for this product.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
