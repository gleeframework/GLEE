"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Consider the significant value this product brings to you - we're talking about $1,200,000 in value to you. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This gives you a great deal, and it ensures I get a fair price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  I'm serious about buying this product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is still a bit low, but I see that we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and I accept $1,012,500?  This would be a win-win for both of us. You'd still be getting a great deal on a product worth significantly more to you, and I'd be able to secure a fair price.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $990,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I really want to make this deal work.  $990,000 is almost there, but it's just a little below what I need to accept. Let's split the difference one more time and call it $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal without further negotiation. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
