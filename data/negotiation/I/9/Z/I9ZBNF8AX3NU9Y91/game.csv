"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $98.  This is a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $98 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $102, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",102.0,Alice,5,
