Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that your asking price is justified.
* **Alternative Option:** By stating you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob might lose out if he doesn't act, even though you have John as a backup.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a price he might consider reasonable."
