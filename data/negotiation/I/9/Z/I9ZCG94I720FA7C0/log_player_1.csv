I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,900,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still leaves me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the highest price I was hoping for, it's still a good profit margin and higher than my minimum.  There's always a risk in continuing to negotiate, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether."
