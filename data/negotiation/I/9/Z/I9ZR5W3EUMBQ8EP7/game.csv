"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1700000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $1675000, but only if you're willing to meet me at that price. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. Can we finalize the deal at $1675000?",1675000.0,Alice,7,
