Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $12,500 is still a good deal for me and it's getting closer to my target. It's also better than the $10,000 I'd get from John."
