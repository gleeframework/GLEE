"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $950000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than what Bob is willing to pay. It's advantageous to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come closer to Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $850000, which is a significant discount from my original price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a lower price. There's room for compromise, and Bob has more leverage because he has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $850,000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $800000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $800,000.  Considering the back and forth, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting this offer saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John and allows him to secure the product.  There are still rounds remaining, but further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely if Alice walks away."
