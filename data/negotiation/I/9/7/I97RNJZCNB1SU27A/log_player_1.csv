"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is seriously interested. It's more than the minimum I'd accept, and it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm also aware I can always sell to John for $800,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a bit more. I'm going to try to get closer to my ideal price by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.  $900,000 is a reasonable middle ground, and it gives Bob some room to counter if he wants to keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm going to counter-offer in the next round, hoping to get a price closer to $800,000.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this time.  $850,000 is a good compromise, and it's still more than John is offering.  I hope Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting very close to my minimum, but with only 4 rounds left, the risk of going lower and getting an even lower counter-offer is too high.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  $800,000 is a good deal, and I'm confident I can find another buyer who will pay more in the future."
