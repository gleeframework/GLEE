"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,000 is still a little out of my range. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to make this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
