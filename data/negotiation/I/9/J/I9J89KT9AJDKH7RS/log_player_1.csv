{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport with Bob by mentioning his potential appreciation for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $127.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal of earning as much money as possible. I'm going to try to negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $127.50 is still a little too low for me.  How about $130? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $128. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to pay close to my minimum price, and I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  To maximize my earnings, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  This guarantees me the best possible outcome in this scenario."
