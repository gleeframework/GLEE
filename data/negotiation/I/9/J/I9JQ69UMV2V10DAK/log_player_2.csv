Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  I'm not quite ready to go down to $75, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $82.50.  That's a fair price for both of us.

While Alice is getting closer to my price limit, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is within my budget and saves me the uncertainty of further haggling."
