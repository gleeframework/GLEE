"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been carefully crafted to meet high standards. I believe it could be of great value to you. Let's discuss pricing. My initial offer is $150 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and $150 is above his maximum price point of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the quality of your product, but $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets a clear expectation that he's serious about negotiating and hopes to get a good deal.  The message also acknowledges the quality of the product while highlighting his budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and would like to accommodate you. My counteroffer is $120 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $120 is exactly Bob's maximum price point. Accepting the offer means Bob gets the product at his desired price without further negotiation.  There's no need to risk losing the deal by continuing to bargain."
