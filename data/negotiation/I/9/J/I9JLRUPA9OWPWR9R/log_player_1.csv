Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This gives him a little room to negotiate, but also ensures I get a profit on the deal.  I'm confident that he'll be willing to pay at least this much, since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,050,000. This is a compromise that is still profitable for me, but also shows that I am willing to negotiate. I believe that Bob is still motivated to buy the product and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm not confident we'll reach a deal with Bob in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing more time.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I get my minimum value, guaranteeing a successful transaction."
