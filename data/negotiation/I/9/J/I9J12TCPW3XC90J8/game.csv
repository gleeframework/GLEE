"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit higher than your ideal price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.
