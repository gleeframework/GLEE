"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it for $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $13,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,250 is still too high for Bob. Although it's a slight improvement from the previous offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He can afford to continue negotiating and has several rounds remaining.  Buying from John would be a worse decision at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on $12,750.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think the product is worth more than $12,750. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. That's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is the lowest she's gone so far, and it's getting close to Bob's maximum budget.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will reject further offers.  Since Bob has only 5 rounds remaining, it's a good time to accept the offer. This ensures Bob gets the product and saves some money compared to buying from John."
