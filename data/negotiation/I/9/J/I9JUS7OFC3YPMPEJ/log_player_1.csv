"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 
I'm going to start high, hoping to capture some of the surplus value.  Bob is willing to pay $120, so this leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I'm still holding out for a better price. There's still room for negotiation and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly from the initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a little bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and ending up selling to John for a lower price."
