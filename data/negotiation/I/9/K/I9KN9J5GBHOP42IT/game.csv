"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from $13,000. I'd be willing to go up to $12,200. I believe that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",12200.0,Bob,4,
