"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is good, it's still significantly less than my initial ask. I believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I believe my initial offer was already factoring in a fair margin.  Would you consider $1,225,000? This demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you consider $1,150,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is moving closer to my target, but I'm still willing to hold out for a higher price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's make this work. How about $1,190,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you consider $1,120,000? I'm willing to make a final compromise, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and while I'd prefer to get closer to $1,200,000, accepting his offer at $1,120,000 is a substantial profit and avoids the risk of continued negotiation."
