This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  I've also added a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While I'd be happy to sell to Bob for $8,000,  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and try to get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
