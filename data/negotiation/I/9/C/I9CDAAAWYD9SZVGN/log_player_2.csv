"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10000. It's truly one of a kind and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting and counter-offering. You're in a strong position since you have an alternative seller (John) who will sell at your maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $9000.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $8500? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial asking price of $10,000.  While $8,500 is still more than my ideal price of $8,000, it's a good compromise, and I'm saving $1,500 compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation."
