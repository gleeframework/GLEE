"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high to establish a strong initial position and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""immense value and potential,"" I'm anchoring Bob's perception of its worth above the $1,000,000 mark. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering it at $1,500,000 gives me space to come down if Bob rejects the initial offer, while still aiming for a significantly higher profit.
* **John as Leverage:**  While I haven't mentioned John explicitly, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to negotiate confidently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob immediately went to his maximum valuation, which is a strong signal that he's very interested but wants the best deal possible. I'll counter with a price that's still comfortably above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond the $1,000,000 mark.  To move this forward, let's meet halfway at $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's true potential while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  By suggesting we ""meet halfway,"" I'm framing the negotiation as collaborative and showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Holding Strong:**  While I'm coming down in price, $1,250,000 is still a significant profit margin above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value beyond Bob's initial valuation to justify a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the product's potential, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,125,000. This compromise demonstrates my serious interest in the product while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Down:** Bob is negotiating more slowly now, indicating he may be reaching his upper limit.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While $1,125,000 is tempting, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer.  I want to push Bob a bit further to see if I can get closer to $1,200,000.
* **Next Counteroffer:** My next counteroffer will be a smaller decrease, signaling I'm getting closer to my bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  Let's make this happen - how about $1,180,000?  This reflects the significant value proposition while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."", 
""product_price"": 1180000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my asking price by a smaller amount ($45,000) to signal that I'm getting closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as ""making it happen"" and acknowledging Bob's efforts to create a sense of momentum.
* **Final Push:** This price point is a good balance between maximizing profit and potentially closing the deal before Bob digs in further or I feel it's necessary to leverage John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,180,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  To close this deal, let's meet at $1,150,000. This represents a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,150,000 is a significant profit above my minimum price. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to haggle over smaller amounts could risk Bob walking away or becoming less interested.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now means I secure the profit and can move on to other opportunities.

While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's $1,000,000 offer makes accepting $1,150,000 the most rational choice."
