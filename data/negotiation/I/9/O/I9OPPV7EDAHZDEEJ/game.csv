"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that will bring you immense value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $10000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $12000 is a bit above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $9500 for it.  This reflects the value I place on it, and hopefully, we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your willingness to make a serious offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10500, which is closer to my budget and also closer to the value I place on the product.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away happy with the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
