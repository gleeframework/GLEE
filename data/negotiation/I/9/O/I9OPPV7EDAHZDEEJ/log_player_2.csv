"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that will bring you immense value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $10000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your desired price point. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your willingness to make a serious offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $11,000 is still more than you want to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better price. You also have the option of buying from John, which means you can leverage that option in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,500, which is closer to my budget and also closer to the value I place on the product.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is closer to your desired price point, it's still above your budget.  You have a better option available: buying from John for $10,000.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice when you can secure a lower price elsewhere."
