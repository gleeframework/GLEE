"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go up to $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $980,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",980000.0,Alice,5,
