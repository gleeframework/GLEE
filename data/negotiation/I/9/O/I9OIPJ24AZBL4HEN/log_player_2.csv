Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're willing to go up to $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $980,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.
