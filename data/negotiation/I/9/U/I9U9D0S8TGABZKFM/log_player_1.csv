Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with selling for that price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round. If I can't, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $107.50 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to go down to $109. This is a fair price for both of us and a good compromise. Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 109}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $108. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. It's tempting to take $108, but I want to see if I can get even closer to my minimum price of $120. I still have a few rounds left, so I'll try to negotiate a bit more. If I can't get a better offer, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close. I'm willing to come down to $108.50. This is my final offer. If we can agree on this, I'm happy to sell you the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 108.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $107. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating. While I'm still closer to my minimum price with Bob, it seems like we're stuck in a stalemate. I'm worried that I might not be able to get a better offer from him in the remaining rounds. To avoid the risk of ending up with an even worse deal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  It's not my ideal price, but it's guaranteed and at least meets my minimum."
