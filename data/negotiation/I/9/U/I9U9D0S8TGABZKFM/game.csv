"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $107.50 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to go down to $109. This is a fair price for both of us and a good compromise. Let's seal the deal!",109.0,Alice,5,
