"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is truly unique and valuable, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000, which is still a significant discount from the product's true value to you. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I think it's a good starting point for a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to consider $825,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
