Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
