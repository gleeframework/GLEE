"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it would be a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely negotiate a better price. John's offer of $1,200,000 acts as a fallback, ensuring you won't be left without the product. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for counter-offers and potentially a lower final price."
