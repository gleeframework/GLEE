Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than $80, I think I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $110?  That still gives you a great deal, and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is tempting, I'm still within my desired price range and have several rounds left. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $110."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to $110,  $107 is still a good price and gets me above my minimum. I'm happy with this outcome and want to secure the deal before it falls apart."
