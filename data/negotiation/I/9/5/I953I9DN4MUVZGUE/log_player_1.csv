I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This gives me a profit of $1,000 over my minimum acceptable price. While there's a chance Bob might reject this offer, there's also a chance he might see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects it, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
