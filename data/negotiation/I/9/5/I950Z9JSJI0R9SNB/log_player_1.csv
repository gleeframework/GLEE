"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate.  I'm hoping he'll counter with a lower offer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I have more rounds and the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more on this sale. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,700,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise. It's also significantly higher than his initial offer, which shows him that I'm serious about getting a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want. I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work. I can come down to $1,550,000.  That's a significant price drop from my last offer, and it's just a little above my minimum. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum value but I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm dropping my price to $1,550,000 and emphasizing that it's a good deal for both of us.  I hope he accepts this offer, but I'm prepared to consider selling to John if he rejects it again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John."
