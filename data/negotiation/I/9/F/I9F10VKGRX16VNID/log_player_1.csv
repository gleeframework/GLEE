Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,150,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price point, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a larger profit.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation) is unlikely to be accepted as you'd gain nothing.  Offering it at $1,200,000 leaves no room for negotiation and Bob gains nothing.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It allows for some negotiation down if Bob counters, while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes value and confidence, aiming to make the offer more appealing to Bob."
