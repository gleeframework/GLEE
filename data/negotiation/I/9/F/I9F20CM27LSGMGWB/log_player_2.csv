**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much on her price, and it's becoming clear that getting a price significantly lower than $108 is unlikely.  At this point, the potential savings from continuing to haggle with Alice are outweighed by the risk of the price increasing further or running out of negotiation rounds. John's offer of $120 is a guaranteed price, making it the safer option at this stage."
