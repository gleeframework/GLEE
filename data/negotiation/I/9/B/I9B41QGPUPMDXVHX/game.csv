"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $13000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $14000. This is my best price for now.",14000.0,Alice,5,
