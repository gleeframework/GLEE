"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $85? I think that's a fair compromise.",85.0,Alice,3,
