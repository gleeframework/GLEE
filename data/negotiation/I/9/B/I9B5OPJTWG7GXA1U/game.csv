"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm looking to get the product at a price that's a bit more attractive. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I have to make a living too! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,050,000. If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,080,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging from here. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
