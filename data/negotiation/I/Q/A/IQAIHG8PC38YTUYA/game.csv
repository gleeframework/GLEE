"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, the product's value to you is quite significant, and $9,000 is considerably below its worth. Could you consider something closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right that $10,000 is a fair middle ground, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to do $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
