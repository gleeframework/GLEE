{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  That's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $120 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to pay $95.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'll try to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $105 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $98 is very close to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price. John offers a guaranteed $100, which is the safest option at this point."
