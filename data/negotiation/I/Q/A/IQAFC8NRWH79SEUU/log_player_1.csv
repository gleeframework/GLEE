"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, which I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while setting a clear initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I am only able to offer $8,000 for it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, I believe we can still find a middle ground. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must stick to my budget. I am unable to increase my offer beyond $8,000. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering his initial price, and although I'm getting close to my minimum, I believe there is still room for negotiation. It's not worth risking a deal for only a $1000 difference when I can potentially get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $9,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sorry to hear that you won't be able to lower your price further. I appreciate your final offer of $9,000, but unfortunately, I cannot go above $8,000. Thank you for considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his offer, and I've already made significant concessions. With only 4 rounds left, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I can secure a sale with him without further negotiation."
