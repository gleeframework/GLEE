"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
