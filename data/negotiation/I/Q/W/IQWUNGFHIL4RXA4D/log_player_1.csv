Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,800,000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good investment for me.

While we're still above John's offer, Bob is consistently moving up.  Accepting at $1,300,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum.  Continuing to push risks losing Bob as a buyer."
