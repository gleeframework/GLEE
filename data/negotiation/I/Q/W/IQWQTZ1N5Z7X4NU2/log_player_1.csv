Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $20,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle you down. 
* **Knowing Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values it at $8,000, he's unlikely to reveal that information.  By starting high, we can try to gauge his true interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Backup Option:** We have the security of John's offer at $15,000. This allows us to be more assertive with Bob.

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. The key is to find a price that's significantly higher than your minimum ($15,000) while still being enticing enough for Bob to consider."
