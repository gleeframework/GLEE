Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  However, I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Significant Markup:** The offer of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup over your minimum acceptable price. While ambitious, Bob's equal valuation of the product suggests there might be room for a significant profit.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message explicitly states your willingness to discuss the price. This signals to Bob that you're flexible and open to finding an agreement that works for both parties.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** It's crucial to remember that Bob is also aiming to maximize his value. He knows the product's worth and that you have another buyer. A successful negotiation will involve finding a price that's mutually beneficial.
* **Risk Tolerance:** A higher initial offer carries the risk of Bob rejecting it outright. However, it also maximizes your potential profit if Bob is willing to negotiate.

This strategy balances ambition with flexibility, giving you the best chance of securing a favorable outcome in the negotiation."
