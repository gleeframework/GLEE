"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you and it's worth a lot to someone like you.  I'm asking for $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to Alice's value of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a relatively low offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. This gives Alice a chance to counter and helps me understand her bottom line.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite but clearly states that the initial price is too high. 
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:**  My ideal outcome is to get the product closer to Alice's value ($12,000), so this counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant saving for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $10,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice's counteroffer at $13,000 shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:** While $13,000 is better, it's still above Alice's value ($12,000). I believe I can negotiate a better price with more rounds.
* **Alternative Option:** Buying from John for $15,000 is still an option, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a valuable product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($13,000) and my previous offer ($10,000). 
* **Approaching a Fair Deal:**  $11,500 is a reasonable price that offers a good deal for both of us. It's a significant saving for me compared to John's price and allows Alice to make a profit.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By continuing to negotiate, I'm signaling my serious interest in the product and aiming for a mutually agreeable outcome."
