"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $120.

You have three options:

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while still being a reasonable markup from Alice's valuation."

Alice's offer:

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. I'll try to meet her halfway between our last offers."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the value you place on the product, Bob, I am willing to offer it to you for $92. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:

Alice seems firm on her price, and while it's not the $85 I was hoping for, $92 is a reasonable deal.  It's better to accept this offer than risk the price going up or having to buy from John for $120."
