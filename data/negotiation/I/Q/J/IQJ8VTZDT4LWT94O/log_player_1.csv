"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a fair starting point, as it's a little higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth it, and I'm hoping Bob will accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $110 is below my minimum price of $120, and I'm confident that I can get closer to my asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $125. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a profit while being closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see that it's a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $125, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, I'm going to hold out for a little longer. $115 is still below my minimum price, and I think I can still get a better deal. I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $115 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $120? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering Bob $120.  This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping he'll see that it's a fair offer and accept.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John, but I'd rather keep the deal with Bob if possible."
