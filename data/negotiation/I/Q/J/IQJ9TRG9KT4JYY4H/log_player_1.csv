Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a starting point.** It's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and open to negotiation.** This encourages Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer. 
* **I've set a clear expectation.** By mentioning a ""reasonable offer,"" I guide Bob towards a range that's likely to be acceptable to me. 
* **Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage.** Knowing I can always sell to John for $8,000 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
