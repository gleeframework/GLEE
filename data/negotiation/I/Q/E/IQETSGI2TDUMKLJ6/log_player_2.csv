"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can do $92.50, but I was thinking we could meet even closer to the middle. How about $91.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
At this point, it's likely Alice won't go much lower. Accepting at $91.50 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of the price going up or losing the deal entirely."
