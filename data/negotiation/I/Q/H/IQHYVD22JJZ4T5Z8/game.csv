"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to go that high yet. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. ",11000.0,Alice,3,
