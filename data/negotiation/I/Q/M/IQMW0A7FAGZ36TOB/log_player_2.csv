"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. If you decide to pass, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. However, she's bluffing about selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000 (that's less than it's worth to her).
* By rejecting her offer, you call her bluff and might get a better price in a subsequent negotiation. 
* Even if she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $1,500,000."
