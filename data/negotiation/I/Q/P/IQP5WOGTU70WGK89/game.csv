"Hi Alice, I appreciate your confidence in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I think that's a more reasonable price, considering the market value.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to be flexible.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $8,250? I think that's a fair price for the product.",8250.0,Bob,4,
