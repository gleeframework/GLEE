"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,050,000? This price still allows you to gain significant value from the product, while allowing me to get closer to the value I've placed on it.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to compromise just a bit further, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept given the value of the product to me.  I believe this is still a fair price for you, considering the substantial value it brings. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
