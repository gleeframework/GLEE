# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?

This price still allows you to gain significant value from the product, while allowing me to get closer to the value I've placed on it.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he'll come up in his price. If he doesn't, I'll consider selling to John."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to compromise just a bit further, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept given the value of the product to me.  I believe this is still a fair price for you, considering the substantial value it brings. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
