Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,050,000? This price still allows you to gain significant value from the product, while allowing me to get closer to the value I've placed on it.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to compromise just a bit further, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000.
