"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** While I'm asking for more than the product is worth to Bob, it's not so high that it's immediately off-putting. He may be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value if he really wants the product.
* **Setting the Stage:** My message is friendly but firm, establishing my initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is worth around $90 to me. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Avoiding a Quick Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling below my minimum desired price, so it's not ideal.  
* **Seeking a Better Deal:**  I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer or at least a bit higher than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $105 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, suggesting a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Value:** This offer is still above my minimum desired price, ensuring I don't lose out significantly.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly, emphasizing a collaborative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $100 for the product. Could we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 aligns with my absolute minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Upside:** I'm unlikely to get a better deal with further negotiation. 
* **Time is a Factor:** While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, I'm already at round 4, and time is limited.  
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale to Bob entirely, especially if he becomes frustrated.  Selling to John is a guaranteed $100, but Bob's offer is the same, with a chance of a faster deal."
