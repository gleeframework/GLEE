{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $80, but I'm leaving room for negotiation to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your kind gesture, but I was hoping to find a way to save a bit more. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down a bit? I'm looking for something around $80 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's at my minimum value and I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is just too low for me. How about $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $85 as my offer. It's a bit higher than my initial request, but still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum value and it's likely that further negotiation will just take more time without yielding much more profit. Selling to Bob for $85 is a good compromise."
