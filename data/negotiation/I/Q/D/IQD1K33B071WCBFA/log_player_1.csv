Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to make a profit, so $1,100,000 is a good starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows the product is worth $1,000,000, so he might be willing to negotiate. 
* **It demonstrates your confidence:** You're not undervaluing the product, which might make Bob think it's not worth pursuing.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. If he rejects your initial offer, be prepared to make counteroffers or even walk away and sell to John if you feel you're not getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy the product for $500,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to both of us. It's not a fair deal, and you have the advantage of having another buyer ready to pay a fair price. Rejecting his offer allows you to maintain your leverage and try to negotiate a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 is too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and your potential gains. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You are willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of drastically undervaluing your product.
* **Is still a significant profit:** You're still getting a substantial amount of money.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** There's still a gap between your offer and Bob's offer, allowing for a potential compromise. 

Remember, if Bob rejects this offer, you can still accept his previous offer or sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $700,000 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is closer to a reasonable price than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below the product's worth and what you could get from John.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good deal and me a decent profit. I'm confident this is a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you are willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss.
* **It's closer to your desired price:** This gives you a more substantial profit than Bob's offer.
* **It allows for a potential final deal:** This price could be appealing to Bob, and if not, you can always choose to sell to John."
