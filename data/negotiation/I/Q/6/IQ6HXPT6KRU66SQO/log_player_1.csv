"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This is a strong opening offer, aiming for a significant portion of the potential profit. It's high enough to demonstrate value and potential for negotiation, but still leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's losing out too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below the target.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation and potentially a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation.  It demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while aiming for a price closer to the desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is only slightly below the safety net of selling to John, there's still potential to get closer to the target value with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

This counteroffer brings the price back up to Bob's previous offer. It's a way to show good faith and demonstrate a willingness to compromise. The goal is to potentially reach a middle ground in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This round is a critical point. While the offer of $850,000 is not terrible, the remaining rounds may not be enough to reach a price closer to the desired $900,000.  Selling to John ensures a reliable and relatively good profit, given the limited remaining rounds and the risk of Bob continuing to lower the price."
