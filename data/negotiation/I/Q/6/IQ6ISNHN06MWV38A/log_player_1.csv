Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum and even his own valuation. There's room for negotiation, but accepting his first offer would be a mistake.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $7,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This offer reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the offer,  $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which I believe is a fair price.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
