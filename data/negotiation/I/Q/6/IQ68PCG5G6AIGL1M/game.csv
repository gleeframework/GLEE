"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth, and I believe you might be the right person. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $750000 at this time.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, this is your last chance to make a serious offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value I place on this product. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be realistic about your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $1200000. This product is worth every penny to me, and I'm not willing to settle for less. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a fair profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
