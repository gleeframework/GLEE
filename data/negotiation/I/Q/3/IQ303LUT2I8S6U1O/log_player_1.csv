Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly lower. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 (to John) gives you leverage. You're not desperate to accept any offer below that. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal that's highly profitable for you while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
