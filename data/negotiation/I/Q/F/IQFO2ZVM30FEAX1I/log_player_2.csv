It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, rejecting Alice's offer allows for the potential of a better deal."

The goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, there's still room for negotiation. It's better to keep trying for a lower price."

Alice has come down to $6,300, which is within Bob's budget and a good price considering the previous rounds of negotiation. It's likely that further negotiation will result in very small price decreases, making it more worthwhile to accept the offer."
