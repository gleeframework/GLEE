"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  You're aiming for a price of $800,000 or less.  It's best to reject the offer and start counter-negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget allows.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price reflecting the potential benefit I see. "", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by significantly lowering the price while still acknowledging the value of the product. It leaves room for compromise and signals a serious intent to purchase."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is substantial and I can't accept a price that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your goal, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's also worth noting that you have a guaranteed alternative in John, so you're not under immense pressure to accept.  Rejecting allows you to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $900,000 is still outside of my budget. Given the market value and my own assessment, I'm confident that $750,000 is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's meet halfway on this."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to show a willingness to negotiate while keeping the price within your budget. It increases the offer slightly, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement, but it still leaves room for Alice to compromise further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firmer on the price to reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still $50,000 over your ideal price. You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $800,000, so there's no pressure to accept this offer.  Rejecting and continuing to negotiate could potentially get you a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer directly targets your ideal price point.  It signals a strong intent to close the deal while acknowledging the value of the product. Since you have an alternative offer at $800,000, this counteroffer emphasizes that you are serious about closing the deal but won't overpay."
