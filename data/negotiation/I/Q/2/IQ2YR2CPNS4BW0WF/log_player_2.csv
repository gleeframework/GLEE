"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. It's worth a lot more to me than that, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is higher than what you're willing to pay and higher than your alternative option with John. By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can proceed with purchasing from John at a lower price."
