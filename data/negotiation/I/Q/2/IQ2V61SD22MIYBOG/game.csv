"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is still a significant amount for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a higher price to make this worthwhile. I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
