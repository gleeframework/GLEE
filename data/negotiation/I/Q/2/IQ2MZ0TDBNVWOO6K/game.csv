"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $875000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested, Bob. However, $875000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to meet my minimum target. How about we try $920000?",920000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $885000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum target. How about we try $915000?",915000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $892500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my minimum target. How about we try $910000?",910000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $910000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $905000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",905000.0,Bob,10,
