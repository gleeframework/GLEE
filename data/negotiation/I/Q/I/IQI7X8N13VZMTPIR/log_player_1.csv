"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that you'll find this to be a worthwhile investment."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, framing it as an ""investment"" with significant potential helps justify the amount. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives you considerable room to negotiate downwards in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is above his own perceived value of $800,000, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting this offer would mean selling below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Option:**  While you could sell to John for $1,000,000 right now, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're aiming for a higher price and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000. This price reflects the true potential of what we're discussing."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're showing flexibility by dropping the price by $150,000. This substantial decrease might encourage Bob to engage more seriously.
* **Holding Strong:** However, we're still well above both Bob's offer and his perceived value, reinforcing the product's high worth. 
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the ""true potential"" aims to draw Bob's focus back to the long-term benefits of the product, justifying the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 exceeds your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Strong Position:** You've successfully negotiated Bob up from his initial offer of $950,000. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome. 

While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer provides a $50,000 profit above your minimum."
