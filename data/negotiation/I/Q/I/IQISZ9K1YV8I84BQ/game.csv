,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to go a little lower but $125 is just below my minimum.  How about $128? That's still a good deal for you since you value it at $150.",128.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $122.50. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",122.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $122.50 is just a little too low for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $125.  That way we both get a fair price.",125.0,Alice,5,
