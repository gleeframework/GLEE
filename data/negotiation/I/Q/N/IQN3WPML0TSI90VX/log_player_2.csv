Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""product_price"": 72.50
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle of my last offer and your last offer at $82.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that beats John's offer of $80 in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the product at a known price than risk ending up with a worse deal or no deal at all."
