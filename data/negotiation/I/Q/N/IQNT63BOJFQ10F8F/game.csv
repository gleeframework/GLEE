"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it can bring to my business.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the value.  To be candid, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,175,000. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price I'm comfortable with.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be at least at $1,125,000 for this to work on my end.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you significant value.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $1,075,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  However, $1,100,000 is my firm offer. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to make a serious commitment to purchase the product.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
