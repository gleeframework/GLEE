Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting high, above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.
* **Taking Advantage of Value Difference:**  While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I know it's worth significantly more to me. I'm hoping to bridge the gap and get a price closer to my value.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** By starting high, I encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price.

**Note:** This is a strategic starting point. I'm prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response and the potential for counteroffers. I will also keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and far below the value I place on the product.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I have a backup option with John's offer of $1,500,000, which ensures I won't settle for a price that's significantly less than my minimum.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my value while still being open to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a significant compromise from my initial offer of $1,750,000.  
* **Meeting Halfway:** It's a move toward Bob's offer of $800,000, but still well above his initial price. 
* **Fairness:** I believe this offer reflects the value gap between us and provides a fair starting point for further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm testing the waters with this counteroffer.  If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. 
* If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer again, aiming for a price point that's both acceptable to me and potentially attractive to him. 
* John's offer of $1,500,000 is still my fallback option, ensuring I don't get stuck with a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a price that meets my minimum requirements.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**  Given that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price, and John's offer provides a guaranteed profit, selling to John is the most rational decision."
