"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1000000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $1200000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows us to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high.  Given the product's worth to you, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal quickly.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for both of us.  It's significantly lower than the price I would pay from John, and it's a fair compromise considering Alice's initial offer. Accepting the offer allows us to close the deal quickly and efficiently."
