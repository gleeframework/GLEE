"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $175. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your budget.** You're only willing to spend $150. 
* **There's a better option.** John is willing to sell the product for your maximum price. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer or buy from John.** This gives you more leverage in the negotiation or a guaranteed way to get the product at your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $150. Would you be willing to go down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 150}
