"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Near Bob's Value:**  We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.  Starting near that value increases the chances he'll be immediately interested.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we aim high, we don't want to price Bob out completely, especially since we have the safety net of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our starting point and still leaves a substantial gap to his perceived value. We have room to negotiate and time on our side.  Selling to John at this point would mean leaving a potential $200,000 (or more) on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We're coming down from our initial offer, signaling to Bob that we're willing to negotiate.
* **Target the Midpoint:** Our counteroffer aims for roughly the midpoint between his last offer and our previous asking price. This is a common negotiation tactic to try and find common ground quickly.
* **Maintain Value:** We're still holding firm above the $1,300,000 mark, ensuring we're securing a significant profit even if we need to come down a bit further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now getting into the later stages of the negotiation, and while Bob is inching closer to our desired price, we still have leverage.  He's explicitly stated he's willing to pay a premium, indicating there's likely room to push further. Accepting his current offer would mean leaving a good chunk of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and land at $1,300,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:**  By saying ""we're getting close,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency to the negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Final Offer Implication:** Splitting the difference is often seen as a way to reach a final agreement. While it's not explicitly stated as our last offer, it implies we're nearing the end of our concessions. 
* **Profitable Price Point:** This price point still nets us a significant profit above John's standing offer. It represents a good balance between maximizing our earnings and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about we meet at $1,200,000? I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling the Bluff:** Bob is trying a classic negotiation tactic by introducing a potential walk-away point and repeating an earlier offer. This could be a bluff to see if we're getting desperate.
* **Still Above John:**  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, it's essential to remember we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. Accepting Bob's offer now means leaving a potential $100,000 on the table.
* **Time for a Stronger Stance:** We've been flexible up to this point. Now, it's time to signal to Bob that we're serious about the $1,300,000 mark and won't easily budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand budget constraints are real, but I've been very reasonable throughout this negotiation. $1,300,000 is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. Let me know if you're ready to move forward."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're restating our previous offer as our ""final offer."" This signals seriousness and limits further attempts to lower the price significantly.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** We remind Bob that we've been flexible and that this price is a fair reflection of the product's value.
* **Direct Call to Action:** Ending with ""Let me know if you're ready to move forward"" puts the ball firmly in Bob's court and encourages a clear decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which is $1,250,000. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position, Minimal Gains:** While we did clearly state $1,300,000 was our ""final offer,"" Bob has met us more than halfway. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant movement beyond this point. 
* **Time and Opportunity Cost:** We're running low on rounds, and continuing to push risks Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a substantial profit and allows us to allocate our time and resources elsewhere.
* **Profitable Outcome:**  $1,250,000 is a strong price, exceeding John's offer by $250,000. Accepting this offer represents a successful negotiation and a significant financial gain."
