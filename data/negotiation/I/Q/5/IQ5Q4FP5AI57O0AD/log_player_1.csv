Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than my fallback option (John at $10,000). 
* **Confident but not Greedy:** The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value without being overly aggressive. I want Bob to feel like he's getting a fair deal even though the price is high."
