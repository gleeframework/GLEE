"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still allows me to make a profit while acknowledging the value you see in this product. Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find common ground. While $1,250,000 is closer,  it's still a bit lower than my desired outcome. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,275,000.  This feels like a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
