"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows you to get the product at a very attractive price. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is a good price for Bob.  He's still saving $200,000 compared to buying from John. 
* There's a chance Alice might come down further, but the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.
* Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price without taking unnecessary risks."
