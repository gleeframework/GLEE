"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows you to get the product at a very attractive price. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
