# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get a better deal than $120, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $105. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can still get a better deal than $115.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not ready to give up on the price just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to get the product to someone who will truly appreciate it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could potentially keep negotiating, Alice's offer of $112.50 is very close to your counteroffer of $110. You're not likely to get a significantly better deal, and you're already quite close to your maximum budget. Accepting the offer is the best strategy in this situation."
