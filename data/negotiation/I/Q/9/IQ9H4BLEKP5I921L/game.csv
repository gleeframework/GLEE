"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $105. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not ready to give up on the price just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to get the product to someone who will truly appreciate it. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
