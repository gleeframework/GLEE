Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,000."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, attempting to sell to Bob first at a higher price could lead to a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $11,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), leaving room for negotiation if needed.
    * Still a compelling discount compared to the guaranteed sale price, incentivizing Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still rely on the guaranteed sale to John at my desired minimum price. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while maintaining the safety net of a guaranteed sale."
