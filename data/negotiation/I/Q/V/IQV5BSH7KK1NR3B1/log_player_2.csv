"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  This is a great price, as you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which saves you $200,000 compared to Alice's offer."
