Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a decent profit for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You won't accept anything less than $12,000, so you have room to negotiate down. 
* **It signals a willingness to compromise:** It shows Bob you're serious about selling but also open to negotiation. 

Keep in mind, this is just the first step! Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $11,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open. You can counter with a slightly higher price, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? This would give us both a fair outcome. "", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm comfortable going up to $11,100 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,100 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $11,250.  While it's still below your desired price of $12,000, accepting it means:

* **You get a decent profit:**  $11,100 is a good return on your investment, especially since Bob was initially offering $10,000.
* **You avoid further negotiation:** Continuing to counteroffer could drag out the process and potentially lead to a stalemate.
* **You avoid the risk of John:** While John offers $12,000, there's always a chance that something could go wrong with the deal, or John might back out.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a good price with minimal risk."
