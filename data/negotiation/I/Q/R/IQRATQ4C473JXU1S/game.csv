"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $15,000. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,
