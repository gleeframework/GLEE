"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  Let's work together to make this happen.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you - $130 is a good offer. To make this work, I need to be a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $129.50, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",129.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to see we're so close to an agreement. $129.50 is a good offer, but I need to be a bit higher to make this worthwhile for me. How about we compromise at $131? That's only $1.50 away from your offer, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",131.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to accepting, but $131 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $129, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",129.0,Bob,8,
