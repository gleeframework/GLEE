"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell for the minimum amount right away, as I believe there is some room for negotiation. I will counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you - $130 is a good offer. To make this work, I need to be a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $129.50, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129.5

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, I believe there is still some room for negotiation. I will make one final counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to see we're so close to an agreement. $129.50 is a good offer, but I need to be a bit higher to make this worthwhile for me. How about we compromise at $131? That's only $1.50 away from your offer, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 131}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to accepting, but $131 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $129, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $129 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's not ideal, but with only 3 rounds left and the risk of having to sell to John for $120, I'll accept this offer."
