"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $112.50. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",112.5,Alice,5,
