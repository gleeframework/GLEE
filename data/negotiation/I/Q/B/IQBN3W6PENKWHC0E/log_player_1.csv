{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer allows for some potential profit while also being appealing to Bob.  By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, I'm increasing the likelihood that Bob will accept the offer. However, if he rejects it, I'm still guaranteed to sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
