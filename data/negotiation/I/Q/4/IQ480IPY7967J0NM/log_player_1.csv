Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price between $80 and $150 allows for potential profit. Setting the price closer to Bob's valuation increases the likelihood of a sale while still securing a significant profit for you.

**Why this strategy?**

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **Attractive to Bob:** $120 is significantly less than his perceived value, making it a tempting offer.
* **Profitable for You:**  You secure a $40 profit if Bob accepts.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob declines, you can still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
