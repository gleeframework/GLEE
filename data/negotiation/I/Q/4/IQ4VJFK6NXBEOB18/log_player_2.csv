"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident it'll be a great investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have an alternative option (buying from John for $800,000), you have leverage."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to me and allows for a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This still allows for a good profit for you, and it's closer to a fair price for me. Let's meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still too high for Bob.  It's still worth trying to negotiate further, especially since Bob has the option to buy from John for a lower price."
