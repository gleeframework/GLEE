"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $900000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still too high for Bob, who is willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. My revised offer is $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's revised offer of $850,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer.  Since Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000, he has room to negotiate further. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
