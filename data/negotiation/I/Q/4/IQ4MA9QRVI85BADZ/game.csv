"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value, I believe $800,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $600,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $650,000 for the product?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $675,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to prioritize my own interests as well.",675000.0,Alice,5,
