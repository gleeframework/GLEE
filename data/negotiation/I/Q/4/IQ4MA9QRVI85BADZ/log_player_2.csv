Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $675,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to prioritize my own interests as well.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a firm line in the sand.  While it might be tempting to try for a slightly lower price, continuing the negotiation has these risks:

* **Stalemate:** We could reach a point where neither side budges, forcing us to buy from John at the highest price.
* **Damaged Relationship:**  Pushing Alice too hard could sour the deal even if she ultimately concedes.

Getting the product for $675,000 is a significant saving compared to John's price. It's time to accept and secure a good deal."
