"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $13,500.  This is a fantastic deal considering its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than its value to her, it's still more than you want to pay. You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move to John and secure your preferred price."
