Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $9,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll counteroffer Bob again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $9,500 is still too low. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, $11,250 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could potentially go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 7

It's my final offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
