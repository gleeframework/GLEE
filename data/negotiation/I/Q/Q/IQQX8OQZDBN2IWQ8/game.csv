"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $9,500 is still too low. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, $11,250 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could potentially go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 as a final concession,  This is a very fair price, considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating.  It's my final offer, let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,7,
