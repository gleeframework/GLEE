Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose we meet in the middle. How about $787,500 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $787,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is very slowly coming down in price.  While she *might* eventually go lower than $787,500, it's not worth the risk of her going back up in price and you missing out on John's fixed offer. Buying from John at this point guarantees the best possible outcome for you."
