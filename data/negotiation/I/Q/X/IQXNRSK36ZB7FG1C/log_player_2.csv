It's always worth exploring negotiation options. You can likely get a better price than $1,200,000 by making a counteroffer."

I'm starting with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's offer."

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but I can likely still get a better deal. I'll reject and make another counteroffer."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still keep it lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still looking for a good deal."

Alice seems unwilling to budge below $1,200,000.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. While it's not the ideal price, it's still within my budget and guarantees I get the product."
