"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $100. It makes no sense to accept. You have a better option with John, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is a more logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $100,  offering that amount is a reasonable starting point. It's a firm but fair price, and Alice has to be willing to negotiate down from her $150 value if she wants to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your acceptable range, it's still above your maximum.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by dropping her price to $120.  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing that you are serious about buying but still trying to get the best price possible.  It's a good middle ground and allows for some room for Alice to counter if she wants to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has become more stubborn, raising the price again.  You've already reached the limit of your negotiation range, and further attempts are unlikely to get the price down to your desired level.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $100, ensuring you get the product within your budget."
