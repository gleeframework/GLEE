"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'm hoping I can get closer to my target in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 
I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $8,500. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price and hopefully appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offers are getting lower and lower. At this point, I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
