Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is $8,000, we have a strong backup offer. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's perceived value if he's particularly interested.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at broader value (""significant value"") without overselling it, which might make Bob suspicious. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** We don't want to scare Bob off with an overly aggressive initial offer. By asking ""What do you think?"" we invite him to counter-offer and start a dialogue.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob will reject this offer outright. However, we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's a limited downside to aiming high."
