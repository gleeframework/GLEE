Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however,  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?

Alice is unlikely to go below $15,000 and has declared it her final offer.  It's time to cut my losses and get the guaranteed deal from John."
