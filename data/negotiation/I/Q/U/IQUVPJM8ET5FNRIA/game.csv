"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $19,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its value.  To make this work, I could come down to $17,000.  What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product is worth a lot to both of us, so let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
