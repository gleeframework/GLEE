This is a good time to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're already well below your $1,500,000 maximum and getting a significant discount from Alice's original offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further haggling might only yield small price drops, and there's a risk Alice will hold firm.
* **Time Constraint:** You're past the halfway point in the negotiation.  Continuing increases the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to go with John's higher price."
