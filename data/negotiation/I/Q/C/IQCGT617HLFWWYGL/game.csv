"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time.  I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",925000.0,Bob,4,
