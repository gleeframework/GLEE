{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price. Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can push for a better deal.  I have 9 rounds remaining, so there's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair return on this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you halfway at $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my price, $850,000 is still below my desired return.  I have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  There's still room for compromise without losing out on significant value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've carefully considered our previous discussions and I believe we're getting closer. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my desired price. While I could try to push for a bit more, the risk of losing the deal altogether is higher now. I have only 4 rounds left, and there's no guarantee I can get a better offer.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and secures the sale."
