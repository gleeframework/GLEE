"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair return on this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This gives us both a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you halfway at $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've carefully considered our previous discussions and I believe we're getting closer. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,6,
