Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The price is below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) to allow for potential counteroffers from Bob. 
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, aiming to keep the conversation positive. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a good sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further. I'll also consider John's offer of $1,200,000 as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to consider $900,000, it's not a worthwhile risk given that John is willing to pay my full asking price.  It's better to:

* **Reject Bob's Offer:** This allows me to maintain my negotiating power and attempt to reach a more favorable deal.
* **Proceed to the Next Round:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide if I can meet him halfway while still achieving a profit.
* If the negotiations with Bob stall, I will finalize the deal with John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my own value for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).  This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $1,000,000 is still a good deal for him, as it's below his estimated value of the product.
* **Keeping the Door Open:** The message is phrased to encourage further negotiation, keeping the possibility of a successful deal alive.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a sale at a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll have to carefully consider my options:
    * **Counteroffer Again:** I might be willing to drop the price slightly more, but only if I'm still comfortable with the profit.
    * **Accept John's Offer:** If Bob keeps rejecting my offers, I'll finalize the deal with John to guarantee a good sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's a very tempting offer, but the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob outweighs the potential gains.  Here's why:

* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000. This is a much better deal than risking further negotiation with Bob, who might not budge further.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take a significant amount of time, potentially delaying my profit. John's offer provides immediate certainty and a much higher profit. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiations have already gone back and forth.  It's likely that Bob is set on his price and further negotiation would be unproductive.

**Next Steps:**

* I will politely inform Bob that I've decided to accept another offer. 
* I will then finalize the sale with John, securing a profit of $1,200,000."
