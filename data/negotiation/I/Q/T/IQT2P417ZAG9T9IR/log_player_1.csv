Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the initial price at $1,100,000. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and allows for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've tried to be friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value to Bob while also making a clear offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While $1,200,000 is Bob's maximum value, it's unlikely he'll accept my initial offer. By setting the price at $1,100,000, I've created room for negotiation and hopefully land closer to his value.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John's willingness to pay $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can walk away with a guaranteed profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy.
* If he counteroffers, I'll carefully analyze his offer and determine whether to accept, counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still well above your value for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. While his offer is low, his message indicates he is willing to compromise and find a solution that benefits both of us. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John would be a safe option, but it wouldn't maximize my profit. I'm willing to take a slight risk to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm confident I can counter with a price that's more favorable to me, potentially closer to the midpoint between his offer and my initial offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. This strategy aims to create a middle ground and encourage further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Let's try $1,050,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** I've set the counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. 
* **Message:** I've maintained a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing the potential for a good deal for both of us. I've also highlighted the value of the product to Bob.

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer creates a middle ground that encourages Bob to move closer to my desired price. It signals my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  By offering a price between his offer and mine, I'm demonstrating a commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will closely monitor Bob's response to my counteroffer. 
* If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* If he accepts, I'll have successfully negotiated a price that is closer to my desired value."
