"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's value of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still well above your value for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Let's try $1050000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum:**  $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than Bob's value of $1,000,000. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  If Bob rejects, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. She might even raise her price.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than Alice's current offer.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures the product at a price that's within his budget and a reasonable compromise."
