"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for a steal at $250. It's a fantastic deal, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price of $150. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $250 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also have a firm price in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $200. It's a high-quality product that you won't regret, and this is a very fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price of $150.  While it's closer, I'm still willing to try and negotiate a lower price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $200 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Would you be willing to meet me at $175? It's a fair price for both of us and gets the deal done."", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to inch closer to Alice's price, but I'm still keeping it below my personal maximum. $175 is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm not going to overpay."
