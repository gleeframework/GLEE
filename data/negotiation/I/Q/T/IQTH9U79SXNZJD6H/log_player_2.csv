"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $12,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's desired price point of $13,000. While she's offering a compromise, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to reach a lower price. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than my target.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $14,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's desired price point. While she's offering a small discount, it's not enough for Bob to feel comfortable accepting. Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal. There's still room for compromise, and buying from John is a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $13,750. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,750, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's unique features. How about we discuss $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to push the price back up to $14,000, but Bob is getting closer to his target price. He should continue to negotiate and try to get Alice to accept a price closer to his desired $13,750. Buying from John is still a last resort, as it would be more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm committed to getting this deal done, but I can't go higher than $13,750. It's my final offer. Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your commitment, Bob, but I've already met you at $13,750. I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about I include a premium support package worth $250? Would you be willing to meet me at $13,750 for the product and the support package? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 with a $250 support package is a good deal for Bob.  It's within his budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While the support package might not be essential, it's a bonus that sweetens the deal. With only two rounds left, it's a good time to accept and avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement."
