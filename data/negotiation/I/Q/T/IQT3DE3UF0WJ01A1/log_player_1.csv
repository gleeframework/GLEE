Round 2

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a price closer to the value of the product. I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $10,000 is my minimum, I can potentially get more from Bob. I'll see if I can meet him halfway in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to close the deal at $10,000, I'm still hoping for a better outcome. There's a chance that he'll increase his offer, and I have more rounds left to negotiate."
