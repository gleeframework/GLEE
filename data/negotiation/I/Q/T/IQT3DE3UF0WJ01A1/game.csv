"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $10000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal here, but I'm still not comfortable selling for $10000. Let's split the difference again. I'll offer you the product for $10250. It's a fair price, and it's closer to both of our desired outcomes. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
