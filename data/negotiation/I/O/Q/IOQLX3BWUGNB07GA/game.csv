"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $950,000, which is still below its true potential value.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",950000.0,Alice,1,
