{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a slightly higher price than what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for potential compromise.  It also acknowledges the value of the product to Bob, creating a positive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it is still lower than your minimum desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference at $9,500?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $9,000, like I suggested earlier? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to that price as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has stuck to his initial offer, and although it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's likely he won't budge further.  Selling to John guarantees a price that meets your minimum requirement, ensuring a safe and profitable outcome."
