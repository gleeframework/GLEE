"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, dropping the price by $1,000. This shows he is serious about getting a good deal. The message also emphasizes that the price is still fair to Alice, which could help her feel less pressured to accept a lower price immediately."
