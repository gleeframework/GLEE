"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","While Bob's offer is below my initial ask, it's still a significant profit above my minimum. I'll accept.
