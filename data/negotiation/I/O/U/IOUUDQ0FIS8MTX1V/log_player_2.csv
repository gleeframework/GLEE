"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is closer to his budget, he can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11750. This would allow us both to get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will either reject further offers or become unwilling to negotiate further. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and minimizes the risk of losing it to another buyer."
