"I'm interested in the product, but I think your starting price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product to your business is significant.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me considering the product's potential.  How about we split the difference - $1,100,000 and we have a deal?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
