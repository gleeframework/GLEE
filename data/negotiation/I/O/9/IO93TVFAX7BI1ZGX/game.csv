"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This would allow both of us to benefit from the transaction. ",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,225,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $1,100,000 is still a little lower than where I'd like to be, I'm willing to go down to $1,175,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of this product.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
