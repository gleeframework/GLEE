"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to go up to $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $140? That seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $150. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal!",150.0,Alice,5,
