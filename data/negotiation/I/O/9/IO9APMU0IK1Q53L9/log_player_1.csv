Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. While we could sell to John for $150 guaranteed, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a good starting point. It's a price that's:
    * Higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but potentially negotiable.
    *  Lower than John's guaranteed offer ($150), giving us room to negotiate down if needed. 

This approach aims for a win-win: Bob might get a price he's happy with, and we might earn more than our minimum."
