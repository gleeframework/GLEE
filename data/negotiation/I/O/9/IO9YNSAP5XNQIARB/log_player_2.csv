"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. I can get the product from John for $150, so I can do better than $145. I'll see if I can get Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $135. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 135}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate a bit, but $135 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer. $140 is still a good deal for me, and it's better than what John is offering."
