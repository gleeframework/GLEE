"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but we're starting our negotiations at $110. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice and see if we can get a better price.  $110 is still a bit high, and there are 9 more rounds to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. $110 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your proposal, we would like to counter with an offer of $107. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while staying competitive in the market. Please let us know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$107 is a good price, and with only 7 rounds left, it's not worth risking a breakdown in negotiations. I'm happy to get the product for a price that's within my budget and a fair deal for Alice."
