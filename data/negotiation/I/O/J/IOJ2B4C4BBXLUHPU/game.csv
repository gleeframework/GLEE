,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, though. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $108 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal.  ",110.0,Alice,5,
