"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price.  How about $14,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $18,000 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  Let's see if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
