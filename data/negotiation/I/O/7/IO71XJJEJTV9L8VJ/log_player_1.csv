Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable addition to your collection. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point.** It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves some room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It frames the offer as a good deal for Bob, appealing to his potential interest. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $12,000 is a good starting point, and there's potential to negotiate higher. 
* **Keep Bob interested:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By having John as an alternative buyer, we can walk away from the negotiation if Bob doesn't meet our expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me ($15,000). Selling to John guarantees me a much higher profit, but it also means losing a potential future relationship with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can:

* **Test Bob's commitment:**  His counteroffer shows interest, but also a firm budget.  
* **Potentially increase the price:**  By counter-offering, I can try to get closer to my desired price point.
* **Explore the possibility of a long-term relationship:**  If we can find a mutually agreeable price, it could open up future opportunities with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a way to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial $12,000 but still offering a good deal for Bob.
* **Emphasizing the value:**  I reiterate the value of the product for Bob while framing the offer as a win-win situation.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message suggests a willingness to continue negotiating, leaving the door open for further discussion and potential compromise.

This approach aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** By lowering my price, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** The message remains positive and encourages further dialogue.
* **Maintain a good position:**  The offer is still relatively high, giving me a strong starting point for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the deal:** While $10,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired range. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but it also risks losing a potential future relationship with Bob.  
* **Potential for future business:**  Accepting Bob's offer keeps the door open for future collaborations or sales.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a solid profit while also potentially laying the groundwork for future business opportunities."
