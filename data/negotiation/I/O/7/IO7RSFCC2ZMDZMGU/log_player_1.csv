Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice makes significantly more than John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure for Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the high price.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
