"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I'm confident it's a valuable asset for you. My asking price is $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 isn't enough to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This allows us both to find some common ground.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is the price I was initially offered by John. I'm willing to take a risk and go with the product you're offering, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
