Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This is a great deal, as the product is worth a lot more to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but significantly lower than what it's worth to me. This gives him room to negotiate while still securing a good deal for myself.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to emphasize the value Bob will get. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message doesn't close the door to counteroffers, leaving room for a back-and-forth.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or end negotiations with him and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000). Accepting his offer would mean a huge loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, or at least a price closer to my minimum.  
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll need to be strategic and consider how much I'm willing to compromise to avoid losing the deal entirely."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  I'm lowering my price from the previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still significantly above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and make it more palatable.
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message leaves room for more back-and-forth, signaling that I'm open to finding a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or end negotiations and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. 
* **John's offer is a strong backup:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, giving me the luxury to be more patient with Bob.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my target price by making another counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again, trying to meet somewhere in the middle. I will aim for a price closer to $1,200,000, but will consider adjusting my offer based on Bob's response and how much I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, but not caving:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility, but not giving in entirely.  This demonstrates a willingness to find common ground.
* **Focusing on fairness and time:**  I'm re-emphasizing the value and framing this as a fair price after the time we've spent negotiating.
* **Closing the deal:**  The message encourages Bob to accept, creating a sense of urgency and finality.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  If he accepts, I've secured a price that's still significantly higher than his initial offer. 
* **Selling to John:**  If he rejects, I'll go with John's offer of $1,500,000, as it's more in line with my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my desired price point and not close enough to make it worthwhile to continue negotiating. 
* **John's offer is the best option:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me the highest possible price and avoids further rounds of negotiation with Bob, which may lead to a lower price or further delays.
* **Avoiding potential stalemate:**  If I continue to negotiate with Bob, we might end up in a stalemate where neither of us are willing to budge. Selling to John allows me to avoid this scenario.

**Next Steps:**

I will contact John and finalize the sale, securing the maximum profit for the product."
