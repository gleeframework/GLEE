{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a significant profit for me and still potentially attractive to Bob, as it's lower than his perceived value of $12,000.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will receive. 
* **Flexibility:**  This opening offer gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. If Bob rejects, I can counter with a lower price, or, if the negotiations stall, I can always turn to John for the guaranteed $15,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000, and even below my initial offer of $14,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I have room to counter with a price that is more favorable to me.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob through further negotiation.  

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to make this work. This price still allows me to make a profit while ensuring you get a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Positive Language:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefits of the deal for both of us.
* **Clarity:**  I'm directly stating my counteroffer price, making it clear what I'm proposing.

**Next Steps:**

I'm hopeful Bob will accept this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to evaluate whether to lower my price further or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm trying to stay closer to $11,000. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob through further negotiation.  There's a possibility he's willing to go higher, especially as he's already indicated a willingness to move up from his initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I'm willing to risk a bit more negotiation to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a certain budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $11,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to continue working with you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($12,500) and Bob's latest offer ($11,000). This shows continued flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a solution that works for both parties.
* **Final Push:** This offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe Bob is willing to pay a bit more to secure the product.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000.  The risk of further negotiation is increasing, and the potential reward is diminishing."
