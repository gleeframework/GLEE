Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000, considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($8,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $11,999, a slightly lower offer like $10,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of John's offer ($8,000) if Bob rejects your proposal.

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
