"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $155?",155.0,Alice,3,

I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about $125? That's a fair offer.,125.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still a bit above $125, but I'm willing to come down to $145. This is my final offer, I think it's a great price for a great product.",145.0,Alice,5,
