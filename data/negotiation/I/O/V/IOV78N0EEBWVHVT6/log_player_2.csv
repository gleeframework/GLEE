Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit above $125, but I'm willing to come down to $145. This is my final offer, I think it's a great price for a great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly coming down on her price, she's unlikely to reach a point where it makes sense for us to buy from her.  She's stated $145 is her ""final offer,"" and we have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate when we can get a better deal elsewhere."
