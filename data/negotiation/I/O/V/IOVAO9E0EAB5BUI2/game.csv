"Alice, that initial offer is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to be at a price point that makes sense for both of us. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  I understand your initial offer, but $1,800,000 is quite a leap from the $800,000 you proposed. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,000,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  Let's make this happen - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
