Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial offer is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to be at a price point that makes sense for both of us. How about we bring it down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  I understand your initial offer, but $1,800,000 is quite a leap from the $800,000 you proposed. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob has now offered his true valuation of the product. We know we can get $1,200,000 from John, so we need to incentivize Bob to go higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value in this deal.  To meet you closer to the middle, how about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could hold out for closer to $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good business decision at this point:

* **Profitable:**  It's still a significant profit margin above our minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away.  John's offer is a guarantee, but the difference in profit isn't substantial enough to warrant the risk. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means we have the capital sooner, which has its own inherent value."
