"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a great price. How does $120 sound? This is a fantastic deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $120, while John is selling it for $150.
* **You are willing to pay up to $150:**  This means you're getting a good deal at $120. 

Even though the product is worth $80 to Alice, you can still save money by buying it from her."
