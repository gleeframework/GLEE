"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you for $95, capturing the essence of a great deal while ensuring a profitable transaction for me. I believe this price reflects the value you see in the product and allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is blatantly lying about the product being worth $100 to you, especially since you've set a $100 maximum budget. Her tactic seems to be inflating the perceived value to justify the high price.  You can likely get a better deal.
