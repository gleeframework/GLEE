{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $149 is a strong opening move. It's just below my guaranteed sale price and significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price point allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially leading to a price higher than $150. 

**Overall:** This offer balances maximizing potential profit while still making the product attractive enough for Bob to consider."
