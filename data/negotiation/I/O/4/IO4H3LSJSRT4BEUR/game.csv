"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that better suits both of us. Given my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I am still unable to meet the price of $17,500. I would like to propose a price of $16,000 for the product. This price takes into account both our interests and allows me to stay within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",16000.0,Bob,4,
