I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my floor price of $1,200,000, but I believe there's a good chance Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay it.  If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for my floor price, so I have nothing to lose by attempting to get a higher price."
