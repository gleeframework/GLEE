"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer because he can still get a better deal.  He values the product at $10,000, and Alice's offer is only $500 lower than that.  There's room for negotiation to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for him, as he values it at $10,000. It also leaves some room for negotiation if Alice is willing to come down further. This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also trying to get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial counteroffer of $9,000, and it's still below his maximum value of $10,000.  It's also better than buying from John for $10,000.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $750 compared to buying from John."
