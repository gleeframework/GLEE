"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This represents a significant saving for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:**  $1,400,000
* **Your maximum value:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000

It's better to reject Alice's offer. While you could save some money by buying from Alice, you can get the product for the same price from John, who is your backup option."
