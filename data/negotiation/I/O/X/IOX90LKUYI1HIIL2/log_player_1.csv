Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is still a good price for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's a significant saving for me.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000? This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the agreement."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's try to split the difference again.  I'm willing to offer $1,112,500. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,112,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,112,500 is very close to my desired price and represents a good deal for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of him rejecting my offer or me not being able to reach a better agreement in the remaining rounds is too high. It's better to take the offer and secure a good profit."
