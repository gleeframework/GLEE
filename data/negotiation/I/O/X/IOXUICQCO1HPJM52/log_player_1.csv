Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from your minimum price of $15,000, making it enticing for Bob while still being profitable for you.  

This strategy allows you to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob accepts, you've made a good profit.
* **Open negotiations:** If Bob rejects, you can use his counteroffer to understand his price range and negotiate further.
* **Maintain leverage:**  You can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000 if negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep the cost below $10,000. Could we possibly negotiate down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, as it falls below your minimum price of $15,000. By rejecting his offer, you can engage in further negotiations and try to secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below the product's value to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to stay within my budget. Would $10,000 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good deal considering your minimum price of $15,000. While it's not the ideal outcome, it's still a profitable sale and allows you to avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations. There's a chance that you might not be able to secure a higher price with Bob or John, and this offer provides a guaranteed sale at a reasonable price."
