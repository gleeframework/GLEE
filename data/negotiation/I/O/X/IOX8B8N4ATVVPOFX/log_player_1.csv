"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I think it's worth to me ($150), but still below what I know it's worth to John. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob engaged without scaring him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $137? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $137 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. If you're serious about buying the product, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 125}
