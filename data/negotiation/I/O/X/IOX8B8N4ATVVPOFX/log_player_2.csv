"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $100."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $137? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $137 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. If you're serious about buying the product, this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125. While getting the product for $5 less is ideal, it's cutting it close to the wire. John offers a guaranteed price of $120, ensuring you don't walk away empty-handed after further negotiation."
