"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm aiming for a price of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a significantly high offer ($2,300,000) to establish a strong anchoring point. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price well above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is designed to be open-ended, encouraging Bob to express his initial thoughts and reveal how interested he is in the product. This information will be valuable in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While I agree it has value, the asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's highly likely we can negotiate a much better deal. We'll provide a counteroffer in the next round to steer the negotiation in a more favorable direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While rejecting Bob's low offer, we make a significant concession from our initial price to show flexibility and encourage him to do the same.
* **Justification:** We subtly re-anchor the negotiation by mentioning ""true market value,"" implying that our price is grounded in external factors. 
* **Target Price:** We are still aiming high ($1,900,000), but this leaves room for further negotiation while staying well above our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position on the product's value. However, to make this deal work for me, I need to be closer to my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to pay above his perceived value of $1,000,000, which is a positive sign. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We need to encourage him to move closer to our range. Rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and gives us the best chance to achieve a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price. Your latest offer shows serious interest. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,650,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We start by acknowledging Bob's willingness to increase his offer, reinforcing the positive movement in the negotiation.
* **Strategic Compromise:** Our counteroffer of $1,650,000 represents a significant step down from our previous offer, signaling that we are serious about closing the deal.
* **Justification:**  We frame the offer as a ""fair deal"" that benefits both parties, aiming to find a middle ground and avoid a stalemate.
* **Above Minimum:** Crucially, our proposed price remains above our absolute minimum of $1,500,000, ensuring a profitable outcome. 

We'll carefully evaluate Bob's response in the next round to determine our next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm seeing the value you place on the product. To find a compromise, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, it's still a significant amount below our target price. We need to hold firm to try and secure a better deal. Here's why:

* **Upward Trend:**  Bob continues to increase his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial proposal. This suggests room for further negotiation.
* **Time Constraint:** We still have a few rounds left, so we're not in a desperate position to accept a lower offer. 
* **Backup Option:**  We have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000) if negotiations with Bob completely stall.

We'll use our next counteroffer to push Bob closer to the $1,500,000 mark."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. You're right, we're getting closer. To be upfront, $1,500,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go. This reflects the true value of the product and what it brings to the table. I believe it's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Finality:** We are being transparent with Bob about our bottom line ($1,500,000). This adds weight to our offer and signals that we are nearing the end of our negotiation range. 
* **Justification:**  We are reiterating the product's value to justify the price and prevent it from seeming arbitrary. 
* **Urgency:** By stating ""I'm hoping we can close this deal,"" we inject a sense of urgency, prompting Bob to make a decision without being overly aggressive.

This strategy aims to achieve one of two outcomes:

1. **Acceptance:** Bob accepts our final offer, and we close the deal at our minimum acceptable price.
2. **Final Counteroffer:** Bob understands our position and makes a final counteroffer very close to our bottom line, potentially leading to a quick resolution in the next round or two."
