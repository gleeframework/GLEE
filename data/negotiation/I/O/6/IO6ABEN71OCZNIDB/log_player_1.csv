"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm sure it will be a great asset to you. My starting price is $9,500.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,500, knowing that the product is worth $10,000 to me and $8,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message upbeat and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I haven't started at the absolute top of my range, leaving room to move if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is interested, his offer of $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I still have 9 rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident that I can get a better price than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Selling to John is a good option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option to sell to John for my desired price. This ensures I don't lose out on a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $7,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,500. I believe this price is fair for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my starting offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive message:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and highlighting that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Building on the previous offer:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing I've taken it into consideration.  This helps build a sense of progress in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference between our previous offers and settle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired $10,000.
* **Opportunity for better price:** I have several rounds left, and I'm confident that I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has shown willingness to negotiate.
* **Safety net with John:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for my desired price.

I believe there's still room for compromise, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $8,125. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm showing continued flexibility by offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, but still within a range that's acceptable to me.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I'm explicitly mentioning that my offer is a ""significant compromise"" to emphasize the concessions I'm making. 
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price point.

By continuing to negotiate in good faith, I hope to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  If this offer is rejected, I'll consider my options, including selling to John."
