Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $11,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it. This is still a great price considering its worth to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $10,200, but I think I can do even better. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but I'm hoping we can find a price that's a bit lower. Can you think about going any lower?"", ""product_price"": 10200}"
