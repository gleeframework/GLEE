"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable product, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than $1,200,000. 
* **You can still make a profit:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to you, so even paying $900,000 leaves you with a $300,000 profit. 

**Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to maximize your savings.**"
