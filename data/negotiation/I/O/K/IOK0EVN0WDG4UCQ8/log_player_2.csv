{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price. While he could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely that Alice will go lower. There's only one round left, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing out on the product. 

Since he has the option to buy from John for the same price, it's the most logical decision to avoid the uncertainty and close the deal with John."
