Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" you provide a subtle reason for the higher price without revealing your true minimum.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly. 

**Important Note:** While John represents your safety net, aiming higher with Bob is worthwhile. Even if he negotiates down, you could still secure a better price than $15,000."
