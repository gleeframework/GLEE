"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product at a discounted price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $1100000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my expenses.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $980000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find reasonable.",980000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $970000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value and the negotiations we've had so far. I hope you can meet me at this price.",970000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $970000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a final offer of $920000. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope you can meet me at this price. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",920000.0,Bob,6,
