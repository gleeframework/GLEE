Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we're a ways apart on price. While $10,500 is still a bit much for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  Let me know what you think.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than his last offer.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
