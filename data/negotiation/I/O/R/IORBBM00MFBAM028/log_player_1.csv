Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it's of great value and would be beneficial to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially landing on a price higher than $80 (your fallback offer from John).
* **Avoid Extremes:** Offering it at $120 is unlikely to be accepted, and starting too low ($80-$90) leaves potential profit on the table. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing your potential earnings."
