Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This gives me a bit of room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still a reasonable price considering the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell for $100, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price a bit higher than $100 to see where he stands."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  He's come up a bit from his initial offer, and $105 is a decent price for me, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $100 if I reject.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get me a better price."
