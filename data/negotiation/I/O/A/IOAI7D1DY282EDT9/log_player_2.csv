"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a real game-changer, and I believe it can be a huge asset to your business. I'm willing to let it go for $1100000. This price reflects the value I know you see in it, and allows for a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get the price closer to his $1,000,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows him to start a counteroffer process and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $950000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business, and I'm prepared to lower my price to $1050000. This price reflects the value you see in the product, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is now within Bob's budget.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially sound decision at this point."
