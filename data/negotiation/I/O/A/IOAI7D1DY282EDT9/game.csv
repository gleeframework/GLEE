"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1100000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $950000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business, and I'm prepared to lower my price to $1050000.
