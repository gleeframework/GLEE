"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $10,000.  How about $10,500?  This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
