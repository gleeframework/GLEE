"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both place on this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the value it brings and allows both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high.  We can keep negotiating and see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm comfortable paying $1,400,000, which reflects a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
