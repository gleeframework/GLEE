"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Gauge Bob's Position:**  This initial offer will likely prompt Bob to counter with a much lower number, giving you insight into how much he's willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both place on this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob increased his offer slightly from his perceived value, $1,250,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a substantial gap between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This suggests there's room for negotiation, and you can likely reach a price closer to your target. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,500,000 gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the value it brings and allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, But Above Minimum:** Coming down by $200,000 from your initial offer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still comfortably above your absolute minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's flexibility.  Will he be willing to move significantly closer to your range, or is he firmly set near his initial offer?  His response will determine your next move. 
* **John as Backup:** Remember, you have the security of John's offer if negotiations with Bob stall or become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm comfortable paying $1,400,000, which reflects a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Acceptable Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's not the highest you could potentially get, it represents a substantial profit.
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  While you might be able to negotiate a slightly higher price, there's also a risk that Bob will walk away if you push too hard. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him entirely. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now also means you receive the payment sooner, allowing you to reinvest the funds or utilize them for other opportunities."
