"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both place on this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the value it brings and allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm comfortable paying $1,400,000, which reflects a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
