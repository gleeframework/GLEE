"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice.  $120 is still a bit much for me. How about $95? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer it to you for $110. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
