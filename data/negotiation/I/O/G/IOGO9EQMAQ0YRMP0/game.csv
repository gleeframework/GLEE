"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my range. I can offer $10,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's split the difference - $10,750, and we have a deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $10,750 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Bob,6,
