"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it at a price significantly lower than its worth to me. Let me know your thoughts!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. That's still a significant discount from your original price, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, it's simply not feasible for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still represents a good deal for you, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,200,000, but I'm still not sure that's a good fit for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $950,000 is simply not a feasible price for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000.  This is a substantial discount from my initial price and a great deal for you. Let's see if we can finalize this transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, and that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.",975000.0,Bob,6,
