"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is ambitious, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent price, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and still below the product's value to me. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation, or even potentially close the deal with John for a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a more reasonable counteroffer that's still above Bob's initial proposal, but closer to his likely willingness to pay. This shows flexibility without sacrificing too much of my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for more negotiation to reach a better price.  It's getting late in the game, but I don't want to settle for a price that undervalues the product.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob or, if things don't work out, sell to John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering $1,000,000. This is my final offer to Bob. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us and John's offer. It's time to see if Bob is truly serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and we're running out of time.  While I would prefer to get $1,000,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and a good profit."
