"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly less than its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still too high.  I can go up to $13,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming higher, I'm willing to come down to $14,250. This feels like a fair compromise.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,250 is still above my budget.  My final offer is $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,6,
