# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay.**  There's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer.
* **I want to see if I can get a better deal.**  By rejecting, I can explore if Alice is willing to lower her price.
