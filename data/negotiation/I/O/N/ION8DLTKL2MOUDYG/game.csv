Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1600000. It's still a great deal considering its value and rarity.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another offer of $1300000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle on this one.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $1550000. It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a final push, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you the product for $1520000. It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1520000.0,Alice,7,
