"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you, considering its value to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not interested. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $950,000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
