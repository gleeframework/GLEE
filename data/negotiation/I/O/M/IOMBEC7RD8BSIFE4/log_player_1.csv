Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering it at $140 gives Bob a $10 discount (making it attractive) while you secure a $20 profit over your minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price Bob is likely to accept and a price that maximizes your potential earnings."
