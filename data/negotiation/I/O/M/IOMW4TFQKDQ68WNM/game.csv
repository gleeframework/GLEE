"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,500.  I think this is a fair price, considering it's closer to your desired price and still within my budget. Let's try to make this happen.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500. This would be a fair compromise, and it's a price I can live with. Let's make this deal happen.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $15,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15,250 for the product.  This is a fair price, as it's only slightly above John's offer and still below your desired price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",15250.0,Bob,6,
