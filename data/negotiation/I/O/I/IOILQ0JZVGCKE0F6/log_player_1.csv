Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your fairness. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I know the product is worth more to Bob and I can potentially get a better price."

Bob is unwilling to budge further, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is going nowhere.  I'm going to take John's offer, as it's a safe and secure sale.  While I'd prefer to get more from Bob, I don't want to risk the deal falling through entirely."
