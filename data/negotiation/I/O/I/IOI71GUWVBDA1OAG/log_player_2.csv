"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $130. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $130
* **Your Value:** $150
* **John's Price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee she'd lower the price, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
