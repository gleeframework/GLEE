Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Reservation Price:**  $1,500,000 (The minimum she'll accept)
* **Bob's Valuation:** $1,200,000 (The maximum he's willing to pay)
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** $1,500,000 (Alice's safety net)

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice has a guaranteed sale at her reservation price with John. Therefore, she should aim to get as much as possible from Bob without going below $1,500,000.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,490,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1490000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Negotiable:** Alice starts high ($1,490,000) to leave room for negotiation while staying above her reservation price.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the ""unique value"" to justify the high price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone is open-ended (""Let me know your thoughts"") to encourage Bob to counter-offer and potentially reveal more about his willingness to pay.

**Important Considerations**

* **Information is Key:** If Alice had more information about Bob's financial situation or how badly he needs the product, she could potentially aim even higher.
* **No Guarantee:**  There's a chance Bob will outright reject the offer, but Alice always has John's guaranteed purchase as a backup."
