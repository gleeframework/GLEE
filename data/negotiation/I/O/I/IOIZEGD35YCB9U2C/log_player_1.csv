Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $17,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a higher price ($17,000) leaves room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will accept immediately, but it establishes a starting point.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning other interest, you subtly remind Bob that he's not the only potential buyer, increasing the perceived value. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know your minimum acceptable price, and you can adjust accordingly throughout the negotiation."
