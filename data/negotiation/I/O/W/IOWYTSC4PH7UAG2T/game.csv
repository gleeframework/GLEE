Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?,120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90 at this point. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little out of my price range. I'm sticking to my offer of $95. I'm really hoping we can find a compromise here.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $105. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet in the middle here.",105.0,Alice,5,
