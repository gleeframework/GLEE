"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $11,000. It's worth a lot more to you, so I think this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still a good bit away from her value and our target. It's worth making another counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we meet a bit closer to the middle and settle at $9,500? I'm eager to make this purchase, and I think this is a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice seems stuck at $10,000. We need to show her we're willing to walk away unless she moves closer to our price range.  Another counteroffer might encourage her to be more flexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,600, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I might need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 9600
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,600 is still just a little too low for me.  To close this deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $9,800.  That's my final offer.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for both sides.  Alice is coming down, and while it's not the absolute lowest we might get her to go, getting the product for $2,200 under our outside option is a good outcome.  The difference between $9,800 and a few hundred less isn't worth the risk of Alice walking away, and us getting stuck with John's higher price."
