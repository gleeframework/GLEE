"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This still gives you a great deal on a product that is worth significantly more. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $10200 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10350? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",10350.0,Alice,5,
