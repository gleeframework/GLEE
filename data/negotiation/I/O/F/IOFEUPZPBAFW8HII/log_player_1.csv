"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I receive a significant profit. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how willing he is to pay for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.  I believe this is a good middle ground that could entice Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  At this point, there's a good chance Bob might continue to lowball me, and I risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price. Selling to John now guarantees me my minimum desired amount, and I can move on to other opportunities."
