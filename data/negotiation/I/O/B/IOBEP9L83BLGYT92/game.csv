"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is too far below my minimum price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still not enough for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's my final offer before I consider selling to John for the same amount.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
