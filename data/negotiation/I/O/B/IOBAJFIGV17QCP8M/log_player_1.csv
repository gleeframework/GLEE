Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. The product is valuable, but I'm looking to make a smart investment, and I think this price is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer yet. I can still try to negotiate a higher price.  I need to weigh the risk of losing the deal with Bob and selling to John for a lower price.  I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,050,000. This price still allows you to make a profit while being fair to me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept it. I'm confident that I can push for a slightly higher offer, potentially reaching a price closer to $1,000,000, or at least a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows you to make a significant return on your investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $975,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one, but I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, we're approaching the end of the rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John ensures I get at least $1,000,000, which is still a good outcome considering the potential for Bob to refuse further offers."
