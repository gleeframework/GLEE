"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $92. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  This is my final offer, as I'm happy to buy from John at $80 if you're not willing to accept.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $88. I can offer it to you for $95. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Alice,5,
