"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering the value it holds for me. I believe it's a fair price that offers you a great deal, while still ensuring a profitable transaction for me. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This still gives you a substantial discount compared to my original price, and it's a figure that allows me to move forward with this transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $700,000.  Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and settle on $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get the product at a good value while ensuring I can move forward with this transaction.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
