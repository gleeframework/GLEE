"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I still think $850000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825000.

I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $825000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $800000. I think this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",800000.0,Bob,6,
