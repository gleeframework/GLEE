"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation.  It's likely Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to her value of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, I can still potentially get a better price. By rejecting, I can make another counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm not in a rush to buy, and it's always worth trying to get the best deal possible."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting progressively closer to my maximum budget, and it's clear that she's not willing to budge significantly. It's becoming increasingly likely that she'll continue to reject my counteroffers, pushing the price up further. 

At this point, buying from John for $1,500,000 is the best option to ensure I get the product without risking further negotiation that might result in an even higher price from Alice."
