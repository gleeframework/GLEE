"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $12500?  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price considering the value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $13000?  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
