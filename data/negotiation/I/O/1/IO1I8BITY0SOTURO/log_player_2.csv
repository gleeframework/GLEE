Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He should counteroffer Alice to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price considering the value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
