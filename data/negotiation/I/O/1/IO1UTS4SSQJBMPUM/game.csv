"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to purchase the product. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $9000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $10500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9800. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $9800. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm offering the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $10200. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price, as I've already considered buying the product from John for $15000.",9500.0,Bob,6,
