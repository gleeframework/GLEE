Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $25 markup ($175) is a reasonable starting point. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but ensures you make a profit above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial price."
