This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for potential bargaining. It also frames the offer as a potential win for Bob, highlighting the product's value and suitability."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely tempting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to consider $8500 for the product?  I'm confident this is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
