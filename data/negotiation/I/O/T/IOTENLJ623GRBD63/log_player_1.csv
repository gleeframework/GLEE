"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum of $150, but I'm also aware of the potential to sell to John if negotiations don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is far too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm trying hard to make this work, but $125 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could do $110, and I think that's a fair offer considering the current market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target.  I'm also mindful that I could always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
