"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is far too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? That gives us both a good deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm trying hard to make this work, but $125 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could do $110, and I think that's a fair offer considering the current market value.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
