"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  That's still a great price for a product you value at $150, and it's fair for me as well. Let's make a deal!",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",135.0,Alice,5,
