Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  That's still a great price for a product you value at $150, and it's fair for me as well. Let's make a deal!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower and getting the product for $15 less than John's price is a decent deal."
