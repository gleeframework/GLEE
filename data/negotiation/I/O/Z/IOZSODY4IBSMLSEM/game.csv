"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value I've seen in the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,250. I'd like to try to get closer to my original target of $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's still a great deal for me, and I think I can make it work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
