# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2,000,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $800000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can meet me here. If not, I'll have to consider other options.
