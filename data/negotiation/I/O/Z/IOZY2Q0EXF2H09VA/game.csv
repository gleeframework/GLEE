"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000 to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for and we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $800000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can meet me here. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
