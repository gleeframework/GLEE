"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer you the product for $10500.  This gives you a great price while ensuring I can make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time.  I'm offering the product for $10300.  That's a very fair price for both of us.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10300.0,Alice,5,
