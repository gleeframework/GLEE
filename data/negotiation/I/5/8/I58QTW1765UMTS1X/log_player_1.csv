Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,150,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, which might encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer is not an ultimatum.  It allows for back-and-forth negotiations and potential counteroffers.
* **The John Factor:**  Knowing I have a backup offer from John for $1,000,000 gives me confidence to stand my ground if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $1,050,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than the value the product holds for Bob ($1,200,000).
* **Negotiation Power:** I have leverage, as I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.
* **Counteroffer Potential:** I can counter with a higher price that is still appealing to Bob. This allows me to maximize my profit.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can engage in further negotiations and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However,  $1,050,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking to get for the product.  Considering its value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the unique benefits you'll gain from this product.  I'm confident this is a fair offer for both of us. Let's see if we can make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I continue to emphasize the value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is still positive and encouraging, suggesting a desire to close the deal.
* **Flexibility:** The counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while also moving closer to my desired price."
