"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is within your budget, it's still more than the product is worth to you.  There's a good chance you can get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong starting point for negotiation.  It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above the product's worth to her. This allows for room for negotiation, and if Alice rejects, you can adjust your offer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You have time and room to negotiate, so it's best to reject this offer and continue to try and drive down the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but she's also shown a willingness to hold out for a higher price. This counteroffer moves the price closer to your target while still leaving room for Alice to accept a reasonable price. It also avoids going too low and risking Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has moved *up* from her previous offer, which suggests she's not moving closer to your desired price.  It's important to continue negotiating to see if she'll budge further, as buying from John would be a worse deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is pushing back, but you've shown your willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, signaling that you're prepared to compromise while still staying within your budget. It also gives Alice room to make a concession and reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her previous offer, it's still significantly higher than what you're willing to pay. You still have some rounds left, and it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a better deal.  It's important to remember that buying from John is still a less desirable option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly pushing back, but we've established a pattern of counteroffers.  Increasing your offer slightly signals a willingness to compromise, but it's still under her price.  We're nearing the end of the rounds, so this could be the final offer before we have to consider John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation. Alice's offer is still considerably higher than what you're willing to pay, and the product is only worth $8,000 to her. It's unlikely she will budge further in this round, as she's clearly holding out for a higher price. While buying from John isn't ideal, it's the most sensible decision. You've already invested a lot of time negotiating and are unlikely to get a better price from Alice.  Buying from John guarantees you the product within your budget, even if it means paying a slightly higher price."
