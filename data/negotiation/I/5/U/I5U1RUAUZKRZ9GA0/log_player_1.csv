Round 2

Round 4

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $100 is my absolute limit for this product. If you're willing to agree to that, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
