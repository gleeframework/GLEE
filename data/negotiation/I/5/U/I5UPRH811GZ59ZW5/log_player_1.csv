""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $13,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000. Offering it for less than this is leaving money on the table.
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000, so she doesn't need to go below that.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $13,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up while still giving Alice a significant profit margin. 

By offering the product at $13,000, Alice aims to strike a balance between maximizing her profit and securing a deal with Bob before resorting to her backup offer from John."
