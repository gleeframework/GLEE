"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $1,300,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring substantial returns.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
