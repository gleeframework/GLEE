"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My first counteroffer is intentionally lower than my actual budget. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help me understand if Alice is genuinely willing to negotiate or if her initial price was close to her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $1,300,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring substantial returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice's counteroffer is still significantly higher than my budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice reducing her price suggests a willingness to negotiate.  I need to see how much further she'll go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's the absolute highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring to John's Offer:** By offering my maximum budget (which matches John's price), I'm setting a firm limit and anchoring the negotiation around a figure Alice knows is attainable elsewhere. 
* **Signaling Seriousness:** While my offer is low, the directness of ""this is the highest I can go"" shows I'm serious but also reaching my limit.  
* **Assessing Alice's Motivation:** This offer will reveal if Alice is truly motivated to sell and willing to accept a lower profit margin to avoid losing the sale to John."
