"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a tight budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $9,250. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is holding firm, and while I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she won't budge much. $9,250 is a reasonable compromise, and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing it and having to buy from John at $10,000."
