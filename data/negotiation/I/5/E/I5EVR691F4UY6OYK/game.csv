"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, I'm on a tight budget, and $9,500 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000? That would really help me out.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a tight budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $9,250. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
