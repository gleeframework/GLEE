"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too far below what I need.  Let's compromise at $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to take it to finalize this deal. ",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my limit, but I'm not willing to go up to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is my absolute maximum. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",9500.0,Bob,6,
