"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  While I agree it's a great product, $20,000 is pretty steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $10,000?  That's the absolute highest I could go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
