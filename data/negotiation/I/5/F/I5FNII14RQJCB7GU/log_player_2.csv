{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's maximum budget.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start by offering his maximum price. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal. It also forces Alice to either accept Bob's offer or reject it and counter with a higher price, potentially putting her in a difficult position."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate and rejected a price he deemed too high. This time, Bob increases his offer slightly from his maximum, hoping to meet Alice halfway.

If Alice rejects, the negotiation continues, giving Bob more rounds to reach a mutually agreeable price."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate. Bob should continue to push for a lower price, as there are still rounds left and the potential for a better deal exists."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price.  There are only three rounds left, so continuing to negotiate could yield a better deal.  Bob still has the option to buy from John for $8,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but it's crucial to stay within his budget. This offer is a significant jump from the previous one, showing a willingness to compromise but still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. With only two rounds left, Bob needs to strike a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding the risk of losing the opportunity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting as it's now within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he'd like to pay. With only one round remaining, Bob has a strong position.  He can reject the offer, knowing he has a guaranteed option with John. This puts the pressure back on Alice to make a final offer closer to Bob's desired price. If Alice doesn't budge, Bob can still purchase from John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer. He's raised his price slightly from the previous round, showing a genuine effort to reach an agreement. It's a good compromise, as it's still below Alice's initial offer but above Bob's maximum willingness to pay.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob has the option to buy from John for a significantly lower price, making him the clear winner in this negotiation."
