Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position, and I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his response.  I always have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Bob goes south."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $800,000, I think I can get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer of $900,000.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $920,000. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, $920,000 is a good deal and significantly higher than selling to John.  I'm willing to take the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
