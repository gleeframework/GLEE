"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and the potential for a win-win situation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This opening offer establishes a strong bargaining position and gives us leverage for subsequent rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above our minimum, it's significantly lower than our initial ask and his perceived value.  We have room to negotiate. We'll counter in the next round to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to find a compromise that benefits us both."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We lower our price by $100,000 to demonstrate our willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** However, the counter-offer is still significantly above Bob's initial bid, reflecting our confidence in the product's value. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and emphasizes our desire to find a mutually beneficial solution, even though we're holding firm on a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is the highest I can go at this point.  If it doesn't work, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,200,000 is a significant profit above our minimum selling price and a good return overall.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has signaled that $1,200,000 is his upper limit, and pushing further might make him walk away.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns, especially with a strong offer on the table. 

It's better to secure a profitable deal now than risk Bob withdrawing and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
