Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $120. Aiming slightly below his maximum increases the chance of him accepting while still securing a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $80 provides a safety net.  This allows for a higher initial offer to Bob.
* **Psychology:** Offering a price ending in ""0"" can sometimes feel more appealing and ""fair"" to buyers.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's an element of risk as Bob could reject the offer.  A different approach could involve starting lower and negotiating upwards if Bob counters."
