Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and aiming to influence Bob's perception.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for my minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there would likely be back-and-forth offers and counter-offers."
