"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:** $150 (maximum willing to pay)
* **Alice's Offer:** $140
* **Value to Alice:** $120

Since Alice's offer is lower than Bob's maximum value, accepting the offer is the best option as it allows Bob to save $10 compared to buying from John."
