"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $120 to me, and I know you value it at the same amount. I'm offering it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $125, which is more than your maximum budget of $120. You can get the same product from John for $120. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
