"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, you can likely get it for less.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $80. This means there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the initial offer opens up the opportunity to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $110 is less than the $150 you're willing to pay from John. 
* **You've already lowered the price:** Alice has come down from $120 to $110. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  You risk Alice rejecting your counteroffer again, and potentially ending up paying more from John. 

It's likely that you won't be able to get a better price, and accepting this offer saves you time and potential frustration."
