"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this valuable product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $10,500, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $12,500 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob can likely still negotiate a better price. He's shown a willingness to pay over $10,000, and Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, so there's room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there at $12,500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting this deal done, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split-the-difference approach, but I'd like to add a bit more to my end. I'll counter with a price of $13,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still focused on saving money. While $13,000 is closer to his desired price, he's still $2,000 away from his ideal deal.  Since Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and meet halfway before, it's likely Bob can convince her to drop the price even further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering our previous discussions, I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'll offer $12,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
