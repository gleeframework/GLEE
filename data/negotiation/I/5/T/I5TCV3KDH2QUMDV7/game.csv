"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,650,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise given the value we both see in this product. Let's meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're both serious about getting this deal done. I'm willing to consider a significant drop if you're willing to meet me closer to my previous offer. How about $1,550,000? This reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that respects both our needs and gets us closer to a deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
