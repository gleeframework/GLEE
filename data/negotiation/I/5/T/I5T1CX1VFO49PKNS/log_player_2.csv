# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential. What are your thoughts?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still too high.  While it's a reduction from her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can get closer to a deal."
