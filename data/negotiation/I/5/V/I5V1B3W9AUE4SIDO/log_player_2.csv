"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. Would you be interested in buying it for $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $125. While this is a good deal, you can get it for $150 from John.  Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the better choice."
