Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. I'm asking for $19,000, but let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000) leaves space for potential negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he outright rejects it, you can always lower the price. If he counters, you'll have a better understanding of his price range. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  Remember, you have John as a backup, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
