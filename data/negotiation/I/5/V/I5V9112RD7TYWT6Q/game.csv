"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen, and while my minimum price is steep, I'm open to discussing an arrangement that benefits us both.  I'd like to start the conversation at $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that starting price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $950,000. This reflects the product's potential and allows for some room for negotiation. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $725,000?  That's a fair offer, considering.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to offer closer to my asking price. To make this work for us, I'd need to see a significant jump from your last offer. How about $875,000? This is my final offer.",875000.0,Alice,5,
