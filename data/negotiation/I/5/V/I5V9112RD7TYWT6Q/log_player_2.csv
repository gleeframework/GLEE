"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen, and while my minimum price is steep, I'm open to discussing an arrangement that benefits us both.  I'd like to start the conversation at $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $950,000. This reflects the product's potential and allows for some room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to offer closer to my asking price. To make this work for us, I'd need to see a significant jump from your last offer. How about $875,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Alice is holding firm and her ""final offer"" is still above your maximum price.  It's unlikely she'll come down further, especially if she has another potential buyer.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, so it makes sense to cut your losses and go with that option."
