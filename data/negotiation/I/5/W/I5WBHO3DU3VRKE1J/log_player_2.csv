"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item is tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations, just like you described. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth every penny of the $15,000. We're confident it will bring immense satisfaction and benefit to you. Considering its worth and the benefits it offers, would you be interested in acquiring this product at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 and Alice is offering the product for that exact amount, there's no benefit in accepting her offer.  You're essentially getting the product for the same price you'd get from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
