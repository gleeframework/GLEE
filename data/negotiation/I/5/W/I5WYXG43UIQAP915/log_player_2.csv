Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob can still try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $9,500 is very close to his maximum budget. It's a good deal, considering that John is selling the same product for $8,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept and avoid risking further negotiation that might lead to no deal at all."
