I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a fair price that's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer of $95 is higher than John's offer of $80. It's also closer to my desired price of $100. I'll accept his offer."
