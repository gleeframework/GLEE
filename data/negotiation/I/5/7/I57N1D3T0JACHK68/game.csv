"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  How about $8,250?  That's a fair compromise, and still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,250. How about $7,875?",7875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $7,875 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $8,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
