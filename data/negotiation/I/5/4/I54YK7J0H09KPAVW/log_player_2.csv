# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its high value and the fact that it's worth $15000 to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I am offering it to you for $12000. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure a valuable asset at a price that is significantly below its market value. I look forward to your positive response.
