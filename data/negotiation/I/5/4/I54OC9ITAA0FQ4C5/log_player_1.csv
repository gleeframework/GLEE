Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still lower than the value Bob places on the product. This strategy gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I still get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer of $140, it's likely that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and I risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit and minimizes the risk of a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John for a lower price."
