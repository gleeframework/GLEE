"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair and competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally wise to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you a sense of Alice's flexibility. 
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message aims to be polite and convey genuine interest while clearly stating that the initial offer is beyond my budget.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer is closer to the midpoint between Alice's starting price and my maximum, allowing for movement in either direction during the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice made a concession, $900,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move down suggests there's more room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You can use John's standing offer of $800,000 as leverage to try and get Alice closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but I still have a strict budget for this purchase. I could potentially do $700,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product's value justifies it."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increment:** This counteroffer increases the price by $100,000, showing Alice that you are willing to negotiate but are still seeking a price within your budget.
* **Justification:** Highlighting your budget constraint reinforces your position and adds a sense of urgency. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's value to you signals that you are serious about purchasing it, encouraging Alice to consider your offer more seriously. 
* **Alternative Option:**  While you haven't explicitly mentioned John's offer, it's subtly implied by the statement that this is a ""significant investment"" for you. This implies you have other options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **John's Offer is Better:**  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at $800,000. It makes no financial sense to pay more than that.
* **Avoid Further Negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a price you are willing to pay. It's time to exercise your alternative option."
