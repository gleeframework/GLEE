# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that the product holds a significant importance to me at a price of $1,200,000. However, considering your potential needs and appreciation for the product, I am extending an offer to acquire it for you at a special introductory price of $1,150,000. This offer is exclusive and tailored to ensure you receive the best possible value while also maximizing my return on investment. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to facilitate this transaction. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly motivated to sell as the product is worth less to her ($1,000,000) than her offer ($1,150,000). 
* You have a backup option with John at $1,200,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away. This might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her actual valuation. 

**Strategy:**

It's a negotiation tactic.  By rejecting this offer, you're aiming for a better deal from Alice in a potential counter-offer."
