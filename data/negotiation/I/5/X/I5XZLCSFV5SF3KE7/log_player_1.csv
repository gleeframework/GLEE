Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd be willing to pay $800000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose to sell the product to Bob.
