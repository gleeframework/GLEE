"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You should definitely counter-offer with a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  It's generally good practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Be Polite but Firm:** You want to convey that you're serious about buying, but not at any cost.
* **Don't Reveal Your Max:** Keep Alice guessing about your absolute maximum budget for now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $110. It's a great price, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, $110 is still significantly higher than both your target price and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $70? I think that would be a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** You're moving closer to your maximum budget, but in smaller increments. This shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** By mentioning a ""fair deal,"" you subtly suggest that Alice's previous offer wasn't quite there yet.
* **Keep John in Mind:**  Remember, you have a backup option. Don't be afraid to walk away if Alice won't budge enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not Quite:** Alice is getting closer to your limit, but you can still try one more time to see if she'll go lower.
* **Leverage John:** Since you're only $10 away from John's offer, you have a strong position to counter with a final offer close to your absolute maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for working with me, Alice. I'm ready to buy it right now for $80. That's the absolute best I can do."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is it. You've reached your absolute maximum and need to be firm.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""right now,"" you imply you're ready to close the deal if Alice accepts.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  If Alice rejects this, you've got John as a backup. You've lost nothing by trying to get the best possible price from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I've already gone a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is the lowest price I can accept. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to meet your maximum price. It's time to cut your losses. You've negotiated in good faith, but there's no point in paying more than you have to. John is offering the product at your target price, so it's the best option now."
