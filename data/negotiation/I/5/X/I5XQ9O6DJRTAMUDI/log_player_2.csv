Bob is now getting close to his limit and wants to find a solution.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and Bob is down to the last few rounds.  At this point, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice is too high. It's more beneficial to secure the product from John at his guaranteed price of $12,000, even though it's not the absolute lowest price possible. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further potential delays or complications."
