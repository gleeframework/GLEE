{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can take it from there."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,000,000, Alice's minimum acceptable price is essentially $1,000,000. Any price Bob agrees to above this is pure profit.
* **High Starting Point:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin.  
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high price and appealing to Bob's potential gain. 

By starting high, Alice increases the likelihood of securing a deal closer to her desired outcome while leaving space for potential counteroffers from Bob."
