"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects its worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price given its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also acknowledges its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating.  He can try to get Alice closer to his desired price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering we're both willing to meet halfway. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $14,000, but I'm not willing to go down to $12,000. I'll compromise at $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While there's potential to continue negotiating, Bob has a guaranteed option with John for $10,000. It's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John and save $3,500 compared to continuing negotiations with Alice."
