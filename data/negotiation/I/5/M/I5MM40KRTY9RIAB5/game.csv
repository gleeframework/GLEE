"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects its worth to me.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price given its value to me. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also acknowledges its value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering we're both willing to meet halfway. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $14,000, but I'm not willing to go down to $12,000. I'll compromise at $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Alice,5,
