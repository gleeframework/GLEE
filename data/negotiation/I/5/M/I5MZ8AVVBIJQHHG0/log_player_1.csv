Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, reflecting its worth while still being within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This demonstrates my commitment to acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum ($1,000,000). It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's acceptable to me within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 now than risk getting even less from Bob later."
