Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this to be a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its benefits to you.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield even greater profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Exclusivity Appeal:** Highlighting this as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a psychological element, potentially making Bob more amenable to the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes I have a sense of urgency. If there's no rush to sell, I might consider a lower initial offer to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* I need to be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Knowing my walk-away point ($1,000,000) is crucial."
