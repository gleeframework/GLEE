Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and positive to establish a good rapport with Bob.
* **Highlight Value:** I emphasize the product's value to entice Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By leaving space for negotiation, I allow Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's being pressured.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and respectful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While Bob's offer of $95 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point.  There's a good chance I can get closer to my ideal price of $120 by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Risk of Losing Bob:**  There's always a risk that Bob will walk away if I push too hard, but I'm willing to take that risk for the chance of a higher profit. 

My next counteroffer will need to be carefully considered, aiming for a price that's appealing to Bob while still maximizing my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives you a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $105 shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and avoids appearing aggressive. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I highlight the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that's appealing to both of us and moves the negotiation closer to a successful outcome."
