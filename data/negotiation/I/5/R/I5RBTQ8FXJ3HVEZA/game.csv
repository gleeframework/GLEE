"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $100?  I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. I'm still interested, but $125 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $112.50.  That's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
