{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that allows for further negotiation."

```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure the deal than risk losing it altogether and having to settle for John's offer of $10,000."
