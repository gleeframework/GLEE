"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1000000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1000000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $900000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $825000. This reflects the value I place on the product and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $875000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product brings to you, and it's still within my acceptable range. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
