"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's significantly less than what I could get from another buyer.  While the true value is much higher, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you and a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Consider it, and let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
