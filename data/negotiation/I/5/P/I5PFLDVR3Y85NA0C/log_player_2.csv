"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $15,000, and it's also higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This means you can save $3,000 compared to buying from John."
