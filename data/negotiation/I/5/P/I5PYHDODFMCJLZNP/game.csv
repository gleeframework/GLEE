"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $900000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it, which is still a good profit for you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
