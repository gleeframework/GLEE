# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good deal for Bob. He can get the product for less than his initial price point, and it's closer to his maximum willingness to pay.  It's a good compromise and saves him money."
