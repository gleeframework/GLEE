Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the value is much higher. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still a good chunk of profit for Bob, making it likely he'll negotiate rather than immediately reject.
* **It's not too aggressive:** If you start too high, you risk pushing Bob away entirely. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for a higher price. By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, you can try to push for a price closer to your initial $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $11,000? That would still leave you with a great deal, and it's closer to the value we both know it holds."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $9,500 is the best option.  While you'd prefer more, it's still above your minimum of $8,000 and a better outcome than selling to John.  Further negotiations might not yield a significantly higher price, and risk losing the deal altogether."
