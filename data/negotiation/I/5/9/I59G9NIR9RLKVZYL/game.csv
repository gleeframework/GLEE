"I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $80 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $90. This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $87.50? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",87.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $82.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $83.75? That's a fair compromise and would allow us to reach a deal. What do you think?",83.75,Alice,7,
