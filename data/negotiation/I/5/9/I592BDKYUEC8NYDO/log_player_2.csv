"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to make a slight discount to get it sold, but I still need to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is less than her product's value to her, it's still significantly more than your maximum price of $8,000. You have a better alternative: buying from John for $8,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for further negotiation or allows you to proceed with your backup plan."
