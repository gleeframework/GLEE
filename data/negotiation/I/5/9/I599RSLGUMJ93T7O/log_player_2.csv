Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm unable to accept that price. The product is worth significantly more than $1,200,000, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000,  which is still a fair price considering its value and potential. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a price that I believe is fair for both of us. I'm eager to reach an agreement that works for everyone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  Your offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,475,000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly enough.  While her price is coming down, it's clear she's aiming for a price well above your $1,000,000 limit. You've made reasonable counteroffers, and continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price."
