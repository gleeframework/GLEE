"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business. My initial asking price is $1,750,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm unable to accept that price. The product is worth significantly more than $1,200,000, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000,  which is still a fair price considering its value and potential. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have budget constraints. I can offer $1,350,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a price that I believe is fair for both of us. I'm eager to reach an agreement that works for everyone.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  Your offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,475,000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and make this happen.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
