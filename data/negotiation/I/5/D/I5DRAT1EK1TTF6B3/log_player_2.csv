Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm going to counter with $125. Is that something you'd be interested in?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice is getting closer but still too high. At this point, it's clear that I can get the product from John for a better price. I'll take the sure thing and buy it from him."
