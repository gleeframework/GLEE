{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's a bit above my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. It also shows that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not giving away the product for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $110 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price of $115. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $110.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That way we both get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $112.50. How about we meet in the middle at $111? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $111 is very close to my desired price of $115.  While I could try to push for a higher price, it's likely that he won't budge further. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a profit significantly above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy with this outcome."
