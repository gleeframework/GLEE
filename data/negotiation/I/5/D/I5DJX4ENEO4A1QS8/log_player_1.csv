Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression of the product's high value.
* **Potential for Profit:** If Bob accepts this initial high price, I maximize my profit. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Preparation:** Even if Bob counters, this starting point gives me leverage in the negotiation to potentially reach a price higher than $15,000."
