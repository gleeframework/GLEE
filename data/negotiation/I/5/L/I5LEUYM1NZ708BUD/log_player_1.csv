Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum price ($1,000,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above John's offer. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept the initial price.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
