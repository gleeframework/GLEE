"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.  $1,200,000 is still below Bob's maximum value of $800,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message explicitly invites Bob to respond, creating an opportunity for a back-and-forth.

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep the negotiation open to secure a deal. Starting with a high price allows me to potentially get a higher price while still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,200,000 is quite high. I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to a more reasonable price point. How about we start at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $650,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's still engaged and willing to negotiate. There's potential to reach a mutually acceptable price in future rounds.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, I'd prefer to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn more. 

**Reasoning:**

My priority is to maximize my profit. Selling to John guarantees a good price, but it doesn't give me the opportunity to potentially earn more.  By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I keep the door open to a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $650,000 is a bit low for me, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's current offer ($650,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and reach a solution.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value of the product to justify the price.  This reinforces my position while staying open to discussion.
* **Clear next steps:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and allows for further negotiation if necessary.

**Reasoning:**

By meeting in the middle, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target. I believe this is a fair offer that could entice Bob to accept, given his own valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum, $725,000 is still below my desired value and doesn't reflect the product's worth.
* **Negotiation continues:** Bob is actively engaging, demonstrating his interest. There's still opportunity to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While attractive, I prefer to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

I'm motivated to get the best possible price. While John's offer is a good backup, I want to maximize my potential earnings. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further exploration of a price that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  However, $725,000 is still below the value I need to consider. How about we try $825,000? This is a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's worth while also allowing us to close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and reason:**  I'm offering a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still above Bob's current offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a price that aligns with the product's value. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the product's worth to justify the price and encourage Bob to see the value in this compromise.
* **Closing the deal:** The message hints at the potential for a deal and encourages Bob to accept. 

**Reasoning:**

I believe this price is a fair compromise, meeting halfway between our previous offers. It's high enough to ensure I get a reasonable return on the product, but low enough to be tempting for Bob, given his valuation. By staying flexible and highlighting value, I aim to encourage Bob to accept this offer and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I have another offer I need to consider. If we can agree on $775,000, we have a deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $775,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would be a financial loss for me. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob is still interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  There's potential to reach a mutually acceptable price in the next few rounds.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.

**Reasoning:**

My primary goal is to maximize my profit.  Even though I'm running out of rounds, I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate, I'm keeping the possibility open for a more favorable deal.  John's offer is a good backup, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have another offer, but I believe this product is truly worth more than $775,000.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we meet at $800,000? This would ensure a win-win for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Focusing on compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer ($825,000) and Bob's current offer ($775,000). This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I emphasize that $800,000 is a win-win situation, appealing to Bob's desire for a fair deal. 
* **Urgency and closure:**  I subtly mention a quick closing, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step closer to my minimum value, making it more appealing to me. It's also a relatively small jump from Bob's current offer, potentially making it more tempting for him to accept, especially given the pressure of the other offer and the limited rounds remaining."
