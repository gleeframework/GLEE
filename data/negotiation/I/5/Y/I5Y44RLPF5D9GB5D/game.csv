"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000.  It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? That's still a great price for a product worth so much to you. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a compromise.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value to you, while still allowing me to make a profit. Let's finalize this deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort to find a compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $9,750? That's the best I can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet there.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go lower than $9,900. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's finalize this deal!",9900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500, and that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,8,
