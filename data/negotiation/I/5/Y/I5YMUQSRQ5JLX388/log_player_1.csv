{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. It's also far less than John's offer, so I'm not taking too much of a risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer to try and get a better price.  There's a good chance I can reach a price that's more favorable to me before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price, hoping to get him closer to my target before I have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 simply doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $10,150?  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10150}
