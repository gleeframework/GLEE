"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 simply doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $10,150?  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",10150.0,Alice,5,
