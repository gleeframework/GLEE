"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, $1,500,000, to see if Bob is seriously interested and has a significant budget for this product. This allows for potential negotiation and leaves room to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
``` 

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. There's a chance he'll come up a bit more in his next offer.  If not, I'm still close enough to my minimum that selling to John might be worth considering if we get down to the final rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is a slight compromise, but still above my minimum, and hopefully shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's only $50,000 below my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price. With only a few rounds left, I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm countering with $1,150,000. This is just a slight increase from Bob's last offer and shows I'm willing to be flexible. It's also closer to my minimum price, making it more likely to be accepted. If Bob rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call.  Bob's offer is my minimum, but we're running out of time. If I reject, there's a chance he'll come up slightly, but with only two rounds left, there's also a good chance we'll get stuck at my minimum. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
