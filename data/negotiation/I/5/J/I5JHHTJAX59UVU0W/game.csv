"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $13,200 is a fair compromise. It reflects the true worth of what you're getting. What do you say?",13200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",12800.0,Bob,4,
