"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 to show my interest in making this deal work. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for compromise. Let's find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That would be my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
