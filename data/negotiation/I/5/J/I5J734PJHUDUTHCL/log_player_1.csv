"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit. 
* **Message:**  I'm being polite and focusing on the value proposition to Bob, highlighting the potential benefits to encourage him to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I want to start high to leave room for negotiation.
* **Back-up Plan:**  John's offer is my safety net. If Bob is unwilling to meet my price, I can always turn to John.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate, but I will not go below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* I have 10 rounds and John's offer as a safety net. I can continue negotiating with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will use the next round to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **No Compromise:**  I will not accept offers that fall below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 to show my interest in making this deal work. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for compromise. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price by $550,000 from the initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's perspective while reiterating the value of the product and leaving room for further discussion.

**Strategy:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** I'm making a significant concession, but not going too low. This encourages Bob to see the value in continuing the negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired range, while acknowledging that some compromise may be necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That would be my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss for me. 
* I have several rounds left and John's offer as a safety net, giving me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will continue to negotiate with Bob.  While he has reached his final offer, I am not obligated to accept it. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I will use my remaining rounds to try and push for a higher price, or at least make sure I get closer to my desired range. 
* **No Compromise:** I will not accept offers that fall below my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Don't Give Up:** With several rounds left, I can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."
