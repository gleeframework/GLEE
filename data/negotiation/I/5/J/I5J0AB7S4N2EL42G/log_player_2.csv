"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $925,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $887,500? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $887,500 is still above Bob's desired price point, but it's significantly lower than the initial offer and closer to Bob's counteroffer. Given that John's price is $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer is the most advantageous choice for Bob as it allows him to purchase the product at a considerable discount."
