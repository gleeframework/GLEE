"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $92?  That's a fair price and allows us both to walk away happy.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I still think $92 is a bit too low. How about we compromise at $97? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal too.",97.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not quite there on the price. Let's split the difference at $94. This way, we can both get a fair deal.",94.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. I'm willing to meet you at $96, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other options...",96.0,Alice,7,
