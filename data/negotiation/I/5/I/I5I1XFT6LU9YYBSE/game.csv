"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in this product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I still think the product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11500?  I'm really hoping to make this work, but I'm limited in what I can pay.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $12200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
