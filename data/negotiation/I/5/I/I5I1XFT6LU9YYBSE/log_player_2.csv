"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal from Alice through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I still think the product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your $12,000 limit. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your budget with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I'm really hoping to make this work, but I'm limited in what I can pay."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $12200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your budget of $12,000.  You have already made several counteroffers and are unlikely to get her to come down further.  Since you have an alternative option with John that meets your price limit, it's the best course of action to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
