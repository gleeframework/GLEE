"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Not Too High:** $175 is still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay, considering the product is worth $80 to him. 
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150). Accepting this would lead to a huge loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it's a signal that he's interested in the product. This gives me an opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed way to avoid a financial loss, but I want to see if I can get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $60 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I believe this is still a great deal for you considering the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm making a counteroffer to keep the negotiation going.
* **Midpoint Approach:** I'm suggesting a price that's roughly halfway between my desired price and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to persuade him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for countering, Alice. While that's closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. How about $75? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $75 is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $150. Accepting this would be a significant financial loss.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  While Bob seems firm on his budget, I'm not ready to give up yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can nudge him towards a higher price.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** I know I can sell to John for $150, which ensures no loss. However, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $75 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  Let's try $100. This would still be a significant saving for you compared to my initial offer, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, as it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.
* **Moving Closer:**  I'm proposing $100, a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizes that I won't accept anything drastically below my minimum.
* **Highlighting the Deal:** I'm reminding Bob that $100 is still a good deal for him compared to my original offer, emphasizing the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $80? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $80 is closer to my minimum acceptable value ($150), it's still a significant loss for me.  
* **Limited Upside:** Bob has made it clear that $80 is his absolute limit.  There's little chance of getting a higher price from him.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds. Further negotiation risks wasting time and potentially getting a worse offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 is a sure thing. It guarantees me a profit and avoids the potential risk of losing money by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

At this point, it's more advantageous to take the sure profit from John than to risk a potential loss by continuing negotiations with Bob."
