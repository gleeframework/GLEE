{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget.  It's a good starting point to see if she's willing to negotiate. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for a price higher than what I'm willing to pay. While it's a decrease from her previous offer, it's still outside my budget. I'll counter offer again in hopes of finding a more acceptable price."
