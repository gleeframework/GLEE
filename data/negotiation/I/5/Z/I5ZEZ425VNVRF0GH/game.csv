"I appreciate you offering me this product, Alice.  However, $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value for it.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise and represents a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
