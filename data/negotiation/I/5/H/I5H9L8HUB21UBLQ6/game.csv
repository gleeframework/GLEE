"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good price for you.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on it.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen - $10,250, and we have a deal. This is my final offer.",10250.0,Alice,5,
