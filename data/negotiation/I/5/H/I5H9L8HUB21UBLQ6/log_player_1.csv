Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good price for you.  Let me know what you think.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting Bob's current offer would mean losing out on a guaranteed $2,200. It's time to move on to John."
