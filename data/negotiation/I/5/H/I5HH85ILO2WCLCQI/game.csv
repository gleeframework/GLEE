"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $14,000 is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your offer, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $9,500? I think that's a fair price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for you. This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
