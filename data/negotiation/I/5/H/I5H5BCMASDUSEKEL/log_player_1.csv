Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, accepting $1,225,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still well above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000, securing a $425,000 profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly moving closer to our desired price point. Accepting this offer shows a willingness to compromise and could lead to a smoother final agreement.
* **Time Value:**  The longer this drags on, the more potential deals we might miss. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation."
