Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're making a profit and ensuring the deal is worth your time.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a buffer for Bob to counteroffer, making him feel involved in the process. 
* **It's not too high:**  You want to make the offer attractive enough that Bob will consider it. 

Remember, the key is to be assertive but also flexible, and to always be ready to walk away if the negotiation isn't going your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take $110, it's significantly below your minimum and doesn't reflect the product's worth.  You'll counteroffer to try and reach a price that's fair for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
