Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone in the message. This can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting that the product is valuable to Bob, even though I don't explicitly mention its value to him.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to negotiate down if Bob rejects the offer.  If he counteroffers at a price I'm not comfortable with, I'll make a counter-counteroffer. If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Preservation:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I want to try and get closer to my goal.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob has shown interest, so there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price that is slightly lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a fair price for this great product, and it's within your range. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $110 to $105. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of value and make it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question to keep the conversation open and invite further discussion. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm ready to either accept Bob's counteroffer if he comes closer to $105, or to negotiate further if needed.  If Bob continues to refuse, I will consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $100, it's still below it. 
* **Potential for Better Offer:**  I'm hopeful that I can push Bob a bit further. He's shown willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room for a higher offer.
* **John as a Backup:**  I have the safety net of selling to John for $100 if this negotiation fails. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's slightly higher than his offer, aiming to bridge the gap and secure a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see where you're coming from, but $95 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $100? That way, we both get a fair deal, and I can get this great product into your hands.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a final compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($105) and Bob's offer ($95). 
* **Win-Win Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair deal"" aspect, suggesting that both of us benefit from this price.
* **Enthusiasm:**  I'm using an enthusiastic tone to express my desire to close the deal.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will move forward with selling to John as it's the best option available to me at this point. I'm hoping that the appeal of a final compromise and the potential for a good deal for both of us will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** $92 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  
* **Stalled Negotiation:**  Bob has shown a stubborn resistance to going higher, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees me my minimum, ensuring I don't lose out on value.

**Next Steps:**

While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, selling to John is the most logical and financially sound decision given the circumstances. It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with an even lower price."
