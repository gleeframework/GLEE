"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above what I can realistically afford.  Let's try to find common ground. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
