# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting closer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. While I'm hopeful we can reach a deal,  I'm concerned we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk going over my budget.  I've decided to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000.  It's within my budget, and I can secure the product now."
