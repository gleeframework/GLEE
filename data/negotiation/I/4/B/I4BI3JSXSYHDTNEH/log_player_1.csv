"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This allows for some room for negotiation, but still ensures a profit for me. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to entice Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell for less than $1,000,000, which is the product's worth to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise here.  $1,050,000 is still a good profit for me and allows for some flexibility in further negotiations. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000, which is the product's worth to me. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $950,000 is still not a fair price for this product.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a great price considering the value you'll receive. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price but still ensuring I make a good profit.  This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining my position on the value of the product. I'm also trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness by suggesting that a deal at $1,025,000 benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to be mindful that we only have a few rounds left and I don't want to lose this opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate that. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, considering we're down to the wire. If we can't agree on this, I might need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is a firm but fair offer. I'm acknowledging Bob's interest while making it clear that this is my final offer.  I'm also subtly hinting at the possibility of selling to John to put a bit of pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to explore other options.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of time. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees me the product's worth. It's better to secure a guaranteed deal than risk losing out to another buyer or further negotiation."
