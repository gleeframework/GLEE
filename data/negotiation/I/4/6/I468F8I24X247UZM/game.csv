"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000, and it's a significant discount from my original offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to consider another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000, and it's a significant discount from my original offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
