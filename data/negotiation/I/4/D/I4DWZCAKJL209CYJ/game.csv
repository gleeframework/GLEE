"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is far greater. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,500,000? This reflects its potential while acknowledging your interest.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I must be candid â€“ coming down to $1,300,000 is a significant compromise on my end.  To be fair to both of us, I'll propose a final offer of $1,425,000. This reflects the product's true worth while recognizing your initial investment. Let me know your decision.",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,425,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be at $1,250,000 or lower. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
