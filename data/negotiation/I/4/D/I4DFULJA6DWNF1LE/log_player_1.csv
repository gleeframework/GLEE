{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount from your minimum price:** This makes it more likely Bob will consider the offer.
* **It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It provides a good starting point for negotiations:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price based on his counteroffer. 

Remember, you can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if you don't get a good enough deal with Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering gives you a chance to secure a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $850,000. This is a great price considering the value of this product, and it allows us to both achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows a willingness to negotiate:** You're not simply sticking to your initial price, but are willing to compromise.
* **Offers a reasonable price:** $850,000 is a midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Reiterates the value of the product:** Reminding Bob of the product's value may encourage him to increase his offer. 

This counteroffer gives Bob an opportunity to reconsider while still keeping you in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $820,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this product, and I believe it's worth it to both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $820,000 is a good compromise. While it's still below your ideal price of $1,000,000, it's significantly closer than his previous offers and is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  

It's a good idea to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation, as you could risk losing the deal with Bob altogether and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000."
