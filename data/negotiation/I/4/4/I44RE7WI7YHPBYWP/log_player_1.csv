"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though we know Bob values it less.
* **Anchoring:** This high initial offer can act as an anchor, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffers to be higher than if I started lower.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts, the profit is substantial.
2. **Gather Information:**  Bob's reaction will reveal how much he might be willing to pay.
3. **Maintain Walk-Away Option:**  I can still sell to John for my minimum price if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. While I appreciate its unique value, I am not able to meet your initial asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly closer to my minimum, it's still above his perceived value. This indicates potential for negotiation. I'm willing to risk continuing the conversation to see if I can secure a better deal.  I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob, and I'm not in a hurry to sell to John at my minimum price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While my initial asking price reflected the unique value of this product, I understand the need to find common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession ($200,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate. However, I'm still well above both my minimum and his offer. 
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value while acknowledging the need for compromise. This framing aims to keep the perceived value high.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is truly willing to negotiate in my desired price range or if he's more anchored to his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which shows he's interested but also cautious.  While $1,900,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for at least $2,000,000. I believe there's still room to negotiate, especially since we have several rounds left. I'll make a smaller concession this time to signal I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $2,050,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm reaching my limit.  This might prompt Bob to make his best move.
* **Small Concession:**  The smaller decrease ($50,000) reinforces the idea that I'm making concessions but won't move much further.
* **Above Target:** I'm still aiming above the $2,000,000 mark, but this offer provides a buffer in case Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Walk-Away Option:** It's crucial to remember I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum. This knowledge empowers me to be firm in my negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,950,000 is very close to my $2,000,000 target and significantly higher than his initial offers. 
* **""Final Offer"" Dynamic:** Bob has also declared this his ""final offer,"" which increases the likelihood he won't go higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to push for more money risks losing the deal altogether. Bob might walk away, leaving me to sell to John at my minimum. 

While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the difference is no longer worth the risk of losing a substantial profit. Accepting now secures a good deal and ends the negotiation favorably."
