"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is far above your maximum budget. It's highly unlikely you'd find a deal at $15,000 acceptable.  It's time to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I'm interested,  $15,000 is beyond my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a starting offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message expresses interest but firmly establishes your budget limitations.
* **Targeting a Deal:** Aiming for $6,500 puts you in a strong position to potentially negotiate a final price well below your $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $11,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, $11,000 is still above both your target price and John's guaranteed offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. To be frank, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you meet me halfway at $8,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Respectful:** The message acknowledges Alice's effort but directly states your position.
* **Anchoring at Your Maximum:** Proposing $8,000 anchors the negotiation at your maximum price. This increases the chances of a final agreement within your budget, even if Alice counters. 
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  Framing it as a ""fair deal""  attempts to create a win-win perception.  

By now, Alice knows you're serious and have a backup option (John). This offer might push her to accept or propose a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you really want this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $9,500 is still above your guaranteed option with John. There's a chance you can negotiate a slightly better price with one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're very close.  I'm willing to make this work, but $9,500 is pushing my absolute limit. How about we settle at $8,750?  That's a fair compromise, and I can close the deal today at that price."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Urgency:** The message shows you're willing to compromise but sets a firm limit.  Adding a sense of urgency (""close the deal today"") might encourage Alice to accept.
* **Midpoint:** Offering $8,750 represents a midpoint between her last offer and your previous offer. It signals a willingness to negotiate but maintains pressure to move closer to your target.
* **Final Offer Implication:** While not explicitly a ""final offer,"" the tone suggests you're nearing your limit. This increases the chances of Alice accepting or at least counter-offering with a price very close to your $8,000 goal."
