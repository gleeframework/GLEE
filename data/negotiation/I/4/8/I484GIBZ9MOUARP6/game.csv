"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This price is fair, considering the value you've placed on it and my own budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $1,300,000. This is a win-win scenario for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,275,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
