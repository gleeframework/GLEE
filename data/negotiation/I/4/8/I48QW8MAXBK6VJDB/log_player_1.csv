Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can do better. I'm still confident that I can get a higher price from Bob, or at least get closer to my minimum of $1,000,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $950,000, but I'm still needing to secure a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we split the difference and I accept $975,000? This would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $900,000, so I'm offering $925,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I'd like to get a higher price, it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  I'm not comfortable risking the next few rounds and potentially getting a lower offer. John is a sure thing, and I'm happy with that outcome."
