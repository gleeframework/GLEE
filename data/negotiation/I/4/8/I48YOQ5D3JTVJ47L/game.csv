"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $6,900. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",6900.0,Alice,3,
