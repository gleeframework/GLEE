"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm eager to sell, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to offer the product at $1,250,000.  This price is still fair given the value the product holds for you.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. I could consider a price closer to $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $1,150,000 is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push him a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000. This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's worth to you.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're almost there. To be honest,  $1,175,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you, and we can close this out.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm confident that I can still get a better price. I'm only a few rounds away from the end, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low, especially when I know John is willing to pay my minimum price."

Round 7

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but I'm still not quite there. To show you my willingness to compromise, I'm prepared to offer the product at $1,190,000.
