"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm interested in the product, though. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? ",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. This is the best I can do for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this done around $11,000. If we can get close to that, I'm sure we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. I can do $11,250, which is a bit closer to your target. However, I need to emphasize that this is my final offer on this price point. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,5,
