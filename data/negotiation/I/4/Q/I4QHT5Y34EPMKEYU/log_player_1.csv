Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your $12,000 minimum, ensuring you don't lose money. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can potentially create a more engaging negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?  I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price of $12,000.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed profit, and Bob's offer risks losing you money.  It's better to reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This price still offers you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer within Reason:** This counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's initial offer of $6,000, demonstrating flexibility while remaining above your minimum price. 
* **Focus on Value:**  The message highlights the value of the product and emphasizes the ""great deal"" at this price point. 
* **Show Willingness to Compromise:**  This approach shows that you're willing to negotiate while also maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  It's still more advantageous to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to your target.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a better outcome, but it's worth exploring if a better deal with Bob is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and $7,500 is closer to where I want to be. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? I'm confident this price still provides excellent value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Finality:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while also positioning it as a potential final offer. 
* **Focus on Value and Profit:** The message reinforces the value for Bob while justifying the price for Alice.
* **Direct and Clear:** This message is concise and avoids unnecessary banter, aiming for a clear decision from Bob."
