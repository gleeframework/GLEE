"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $650,000.  Let me know if that's a possibility.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the inherent value of the product.  While $650,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $975,000? This reflects the product's worth while still providing you with significant value.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  While I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  I can go up to $725,000.  This offer reflects a fair price for both of us, I believe.  Let me know your thoughts.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $725,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. ",900000.0,Alice,5,
