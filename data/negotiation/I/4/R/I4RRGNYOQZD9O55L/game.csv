"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,350,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is my maximum offer, as I can purchase the product from another vendor for that price.  Let me know if you're open to this.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price point. Let me know your decision.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
