Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,350,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is my maximum offer, as I can purchase the product from another vendor for that price.  Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
