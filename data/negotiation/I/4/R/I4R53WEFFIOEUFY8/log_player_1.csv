{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  I know it's a high price, but this product is truly unique and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you. Let's chat about it."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need to get for the product. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not quite there.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for the value this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the value I'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I truly believe this is a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the value I'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still far too low for the value of the product. While I am open to negotiation, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing a sale to John, who is willing to pay my desired price."
