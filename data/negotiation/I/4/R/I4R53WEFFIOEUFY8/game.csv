"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000.  I know it's a high price, but this product is truly unique and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you. Let's chat about it.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not quite there.  $1200000 is a bit too low for the value this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1400000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price to $1600000. This represents a significant compromise, and I truly believe this is a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
