"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm confident its value to you will make this a mutually beneficial transaction.

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the product's potential, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price given the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it falls short of the true value I place on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,050,000. This price acknowledges the value we both see in it while remaining a fair compromise.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This price reflects the value we both see in it, while also being a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits us both.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the product's true value while still giving you a fair deal. Let's close this deal and move forward with this valuable opportunity.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
