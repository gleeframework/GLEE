"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item and I think you might be interested. I'm thinking of a price around $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80, which is the fair market value for this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer of $80, which is my absolute minimum. There's no guarantee further negotiation will yield a better result, and I risk losing John's offer if I delay."
