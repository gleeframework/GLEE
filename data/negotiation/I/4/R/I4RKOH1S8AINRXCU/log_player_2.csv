"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which we believe holds immense value for you. Considering its worth to you is $1,500,000, I am offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a special offer tailored to ensure both parties benefit from this transaction. Let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you need more information about the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but you can potentially get a better deal. You know the product is worth $800,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking for a price closer to the product's value for you. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a revised offer of $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the product's value to you and the opportunity cost for me. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and facilitates a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,200,000, and it brings the price closer to your ideal range. Accepting this offer saves you $500,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to Alice. There's still some room for negotiation, but the risk of further negotiations delaying the transaction or Alice potentially raising her price again makes accepting the current offer the most sensible choice."
