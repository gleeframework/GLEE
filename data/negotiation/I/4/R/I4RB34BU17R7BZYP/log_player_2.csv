"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer.  $15,000 is way over Bob's budget, and he can get the same product for $10,000 from John.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Bob is going to start by offering $8,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still a decent starting point.  If Alice is willing to negotiate, she'll likely counter with a price closer to $10,000.  If Alice doesn't budge, then Bob will always have the option to go to John and get the product for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than the $10,000 he can get from John.  It's likely that Alice will continue to drop her price if Bob keeps rejecting, making it more worthwhile to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob is going to increase his offer to $9,500. This is closer to Alice's last offer, showing that he's willing to negotiate. He's still below his $10,000 maximum, but he wants to see if he can get a deal closer to that price. It's a good compromise point, and if Alice rejects, he can still go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,500 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than the $10,000 he can get from John.  It seems like Alice is slowly coming down in price, and Bob can likely negotiate a better deal by continuing to reject and counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

Bob is going to increase his offer to $10,500.  He's getting closer to his maximum budget, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, and he's only a small step away from his maximum price. If Alice rejects, he'll finally go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still higher than his maximum budget, and she's shown a reluctance to come down to his price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
