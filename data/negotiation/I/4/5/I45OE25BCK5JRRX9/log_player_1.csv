Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm willing to negotiate and adjust the price based on Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, it is still significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. Therefore, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm willing to lower my price slightly from the initial offer to $1,550,000, still above my minimum threshold. This reflects my commitment to the negotiation but also indicates my desire for a price closer to my valuation of the product."
