"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price. While there's no guarantee of a better deal, it's worth negotiating with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $1,300,000 is a bold move, but it's a starting point for negotiation.  It's below Alice's desired price, but it's still within Bob's budget. This counteroffer creates room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's only $50,000 more than John's offer.  Given that Alice has already rejected a lower offer, there's a risk of a drawn-out negotiation that could lead to a higher final price.  Accepting Alice's offer minimizes the risk and saves Bob from potential further negotiations."
