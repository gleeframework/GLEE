"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price early on.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and how many rounds remain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  With 9 rounds left, I have time to work towards a mutually acceptable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $18,000, which is still a good profit for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob. I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but I still have 6 rounds left. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. There's a chance Bob might increase his offer, and I'm not willing to settle for a lower price than $15,000 unless I'm running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

I'm lowering my price to $16,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer but still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not willing to settle for less.  I'm going to continue negotiating. With 4 rounds left, I'm going to keep pushing for a price closer to my desired amount."

This is my final offer. It's my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to sell it to John for this price if Bob doesn't accept. With only 3 rounds left, I need to finalize a deal."
