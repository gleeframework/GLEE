Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet at $90? It's still a good price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my budget but still not willing to go lower than $90. I've only got 3 rounds left and it's likely she won't go lower, so I'm going to buy from John.  I'd rather have the product and avoid any more negotiation."
