"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's make this happen!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I can manage right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still just a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $11,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!",11250.0,Alice,5,
