"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate for a lower price, especially since we have the option to buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This counteroffer is a strong starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, which allows room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but her offer is still higher than what John is offering. We need to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We are moving closer to a potential deal.
* This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to John's offer while still giving Alice room to negotiate. 
* It's important to remain polite and frame the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage a positive response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

*  Alice states this is her ""final offer,"" which increases the risk of her walking away in future rounds.
* However, we are still $500 away from John's price. It's worth taking a calculated risk to see if we can get closer to John's price, even if it means potentially losing the deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm ready to close this deal today, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. If you're willing to come down to $9,250, I'll accept right away."",
""product_price"": 9250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Decisive:** The message clearly states your willingness to ""close the deal today."" This adds a sense of urgency and emphasizes your seriousness. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Offering $9,250 represents a compromise â€“  it's slightly above the midpoint between her last offer and your last counteroffer.
* **Final Push:** While you don't want to explicitly say it's your ""final offer,"" this counteroffer signals that you're close to your limit and ready to walk away if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm almost there, but $9,250 is still just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,375? This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** While not ideal, $9,375 is only $625 more than John's offer. Further haggling might irritate Alice and risk the deal.
* **Time Factor:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Continuing might force us to settle for John's offer anyway, losing the potential savings we've negotiated with Alice.
* **Compromise Reached:** Alice has consistently moved towards a compromise. Accepting now shows good faith and avoids the risk of her withdrawing from the negotiation altogether."
