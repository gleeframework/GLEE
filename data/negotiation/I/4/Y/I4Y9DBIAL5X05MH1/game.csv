"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets the deal done.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm ready to close this deal today, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. If you're willing to come down to $9,250, I'll accept right away.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm almost there, but $9,250 is still just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,375? This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this today.",9375.0,Alice,7,
