"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum. It's better to reject and see if a better price can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  Bob starts with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This signals his strong desire to get a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $950,000 is still below Bob's maximum, it leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling pressured to drop to his price immediately. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's price:** Alice's offer is only $25,000 more than what Bob can buy it for from John. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting and making another counteroffer. It's worth trying to get closer to $1,000,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is Bob's final offer, signaling he's reached his limit. 
* **Justification:** The message explains why Bob is at his limit, which can help persuade Alice.
* **Focus on Agreement:** The message emphasizes finding an agreement, creating a sense of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's price:** Alice's final offer is only $75,000 less than what Bob can buy it for from John.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of going over Bob's budget or wasting valuable time. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Buying from John guarantees a deal within Bob's budget. 

It's better to secure the product from John at $1,000,000 than risk further negotiations with Alice that might result in a higher price."
