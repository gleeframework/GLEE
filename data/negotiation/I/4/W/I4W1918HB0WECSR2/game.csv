"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $12,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $11,250 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to budge a little further.  How about $11,750?  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,
