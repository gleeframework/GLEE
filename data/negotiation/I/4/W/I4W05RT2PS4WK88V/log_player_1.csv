Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's maximum**: We know Bob values the product at $8,000.  This doesn't directly influence our offer price, but it tells us we have some room to negotiate if needed. 
* **Aiming High, Starting Strong**:  By starting with an offer of $19,000, we anchor the negotiation higher than John's guaranteed offer. This leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Justification**:  The message subtly implies high demand and value by mentioning ""other interest"". This aims to increase the perceived value for Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation is Key**:  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. 
* **John's Offer is your safety net**: Remember, you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000. Don't feel pressured to accept anything less."
