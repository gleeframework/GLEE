,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the highest I can go. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This reflects the value this product offers while acknowledging your budget concerns.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, which is the highest I can go. I'm still interested in making a deal, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
