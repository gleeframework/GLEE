"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible. However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,500 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a little tight.  How about $11,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think $11,250 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know you're serious about buying the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,150. This is my final offer.
