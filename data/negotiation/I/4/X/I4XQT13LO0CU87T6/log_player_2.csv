"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While $1,200,000 is less than what he'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  There's a significant difference between Alice's value ($800,000) and her offer, indicating she has room to lower the price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This price still represents a significant discount for you, but also reflects the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,150,000 is better than her initial offer, there's still a decent gap between her offer and his ideal price point.  Since he has a fallback option with John, it makes sense to try and squeeze out a bit more savings by continuing the negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While she's come down a bit from her initial offer, it's still too high for him.  He's already made a counteroffer and gotten her to budge. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
