"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  How about we split the difference again and land at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $1,075,000 for it. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
