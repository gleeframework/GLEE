"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has started at her absolute highest price.  While she might not be willing to budge much, it's always worth negotiating to see if you can save even a small amount of money. There's no downside to a counter-offer at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Starting with a significant but not insulting counter-offer gives us room to negotiate.  It also helps gauge how flexible Alice might be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved from her initial offer, which is a good sign.  However, there's still room for negotiation. Meeting in the middle again puts us closer to a price point that works for us while still potentially being acceptable to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  How about we split the difference again and land at $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This keeps the negotiation moving forward while demonstrating willingness to compromise.  A $50,000 difference might be small enough for Alice to accept, but it's still a significant saving for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $1,075,000 for it. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While we could continue pushing, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $1,075,000 secures a $125,000 discount from both Alice's original price and John's offer. This seems like a reasonable compromise and a good deal for both parties."
