"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a good starting offer from Alice, but there's room for negotiation.  Bob knows he can get it cheaper from John if needed, so he should make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to establish a lower price point while still leaving room for further negotiation. It acknowledges Alice's offer but signals that Bob is serious about getting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This gives us both a good deal, and it's still a significant savings for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but Bob still has some negotiating room. He should make another counteroffer, aiming slightly below the midpoint between their last two offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($10,500) and Bob's previous offer ($9,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards Bob's target price range."
