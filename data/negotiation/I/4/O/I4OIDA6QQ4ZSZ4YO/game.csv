"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider a price closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $925,000. This represents a significant investment for me, but I see the value in the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $925,000 is a significant investment for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make it. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $975,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. How about we discuss a price of $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line to consider.  Let's make this happen.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your commitment to the deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to make a profit. However, I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000 if you're willing to meet me halfway. Let's see if we can make it work.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
