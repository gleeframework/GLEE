Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $975,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. How about we discuss a price of $1,025,000?

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your commitment to the deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to make a profit. However, I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000 if you're willing to meet me halfway. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has budged very little and is unlikely to go lower. Accepting the $1,025,000 offer is a reasonable compromise to ensure you get the product while staying well below John's $1,500,000 price."
