Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm aware that Bob values the product at $80, so I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$87.5 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's above my minimum acceptable price.  This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm getting tired of this back-and-forth. It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
