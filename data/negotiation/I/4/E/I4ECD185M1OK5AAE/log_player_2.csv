This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you. Let's see if we can agree on this price.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his desired price. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000 or consider buying from John if he's not confident he can get a better price from Alice."
