Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit bolder in your ask.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain, which is still a good incentive for him.
* **Confident Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as fair rather than negotiable.
* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" can add perceived value and urgency.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will determine your next move. If he negotiates, be prepared to adjust slightly, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Alternative:** You could start with an even higher offer (closer to $1,200,000) and leave more room for negotiation. This approach is riskier but could yield a higher profit if Bob is willing to pay top dollar."
