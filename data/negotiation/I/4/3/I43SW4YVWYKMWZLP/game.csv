"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for both of us to profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $1,000,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering both our positions. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a significant reduction, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive offer for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
