"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to get a better price.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for both of us to profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $1,000,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still a bit high, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate.  By rejecting this offer, I can continue to push for a lower price.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000, or even slightly higher if necessary to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering both our positions. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a significant reduction, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive offer for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is a significant drop from her previous offer and is getting closer to my desired price range. It's a good deal for me as it saves me a considerable amount compared to buying from John.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of reaching a stalemate and having to buy from John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.  Accepting this offer ensures I secure the product at a reasonable cost."
