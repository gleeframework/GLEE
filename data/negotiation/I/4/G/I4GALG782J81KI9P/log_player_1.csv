Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  $1,600,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations risks Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a guaranteed profit.
* **John's Offer:** Although John offers $1,500,000, accepting Bob's higher offer maximizes my earnings."
