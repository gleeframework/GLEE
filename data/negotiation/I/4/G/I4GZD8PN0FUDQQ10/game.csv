"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $1200000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1050000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1150000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000 for the product. This is a fair offer that allows for a good profit for you while staying within my financial limitations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1100000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1120000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
