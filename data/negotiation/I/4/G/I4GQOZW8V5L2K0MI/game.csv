,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $9,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $9,200. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. ",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8,750 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $9,100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,100 is still a bit too much for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to move on.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,900 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,100 and $8,900, so I can sell the product to you for $9,000. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,7,
