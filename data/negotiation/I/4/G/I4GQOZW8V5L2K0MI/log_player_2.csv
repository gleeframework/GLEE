"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this product, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $9,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $9,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $9,200. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is slightly lower, it's still above Bob's budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,750 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $9,100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's getting closer to his budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  He has a few more rounds to negotiate, and he should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,100 is still a bit too much for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to move on."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,900 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,100 and $8,900, so I can sell the product to you for $9,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's budget, and he's already made several counteroffers.  It's likely that Alice will continue to hold out for a higher price, and there's no guarantee that Bob will be able to get a better deal with her.  It's time to cut his losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
