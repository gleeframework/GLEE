"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  My initial offer is $1,150,000.  I'm confident this price represents a fair value for both of us, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a bit more within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000.  This would allow me to cover my costs and still leave some room for profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
