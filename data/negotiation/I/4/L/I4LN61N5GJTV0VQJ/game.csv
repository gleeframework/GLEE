"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  This is my final offer.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. This is my final counteroffer.",105.0,Alice,5,
