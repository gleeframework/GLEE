"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  I'm happy to meet you at $1100000.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from another seller.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $1080000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
