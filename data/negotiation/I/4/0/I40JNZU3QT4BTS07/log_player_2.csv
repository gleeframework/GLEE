"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your ideal price point. You can potentially negotiate further and aim for a price closer to your budget. It's worth rejecting her offer and trying for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  I'm happy to meet you at $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from another seller."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $1080000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is within your budget and is a good compromise.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she might reject your counteroffer and you'd end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer gives you a better deal than buying from John."
