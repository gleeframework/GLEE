Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($15,000) than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I could start higher, a price of $12,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Securing a Significant Profit:** This price point allows me to secure a $4,000 profit, which is a substantial gain compared to John's offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
