"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operation, and I'm excited to discuss a deal. To start the conversation, I'm offering it at $2,250,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $1,000,000. This is my best and final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I have to be honest, $1,000,000 is significantly below its market value. I can't let it go for anything less than $2,000,000. This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to find a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  Although she claims to be willing to find a fair deal, her counteroffer is only a small reduction from her original price.  It's clear that she's not willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  At this point, it's more advantageous to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation."
