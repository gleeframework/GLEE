"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a good profit. I believe this is a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a price that provides me with a decent profit. I believe this price is fair and could be appealing to Bob considering he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm running out of time and negotiation rounds.  It's not worth risking further negotiation at this point. I'll take John's offer of $10,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value for the product."
