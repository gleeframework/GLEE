"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider  $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can do $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
