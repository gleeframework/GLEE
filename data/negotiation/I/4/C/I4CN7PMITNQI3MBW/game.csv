"I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a price that works for us both, $9,500 is a bit too low considering the true value of this product.  Would you consider $11,500? It's a compromise that reflects the worth you'll gain from it.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
