{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Alice's offer. $95 is too high, and I can get the product from John for $100 if I need to. I'll see if I can get a better price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90. How about we split the difference and I pay $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us close the deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $89.  Let's close this deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Alice's offer. While I was hoping to get it down to $87.50, $89 is still a good deal and within my budget.  It's better than going with John and paying $100."
