Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, knowing that Bob values it the same. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my target price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still maintaining a profit for myself. I believe this counteroffer is more likely to be accepted by Bob, while still being close to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price I'd get from John. There's no incentive to continue negotiating, so I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
