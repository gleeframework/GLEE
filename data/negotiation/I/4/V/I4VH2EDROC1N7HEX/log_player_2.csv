"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above my maximum budget ($15,000).**  
* **I have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives me room to try and get a better price. 
* **I want to save as much money as possible.** 

Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in your product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price closer to Alice's value of $12,000. This shows I'm serious about buying but also trying to save.
* **Not too aggressive:**  I'm not going straight to my absolute bottom line, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable justification:** I'm offering a price that is still within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.** I'm looking to save as much as possible.
* **I have several rounds left.**  I can continue to negotiate and hopefully get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.** If negotiations fail, I can purchase from him. 

By rejecting Alice's offer and counteroffering, I'm increasing the chances of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,250 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This shows a willingness to compromise and indicates a desire to finalize the deal.
* **Staying within my budget:**  $13,000 is still within my $15,000 limit.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm emphasizing fairness and the potential for a positive outcome."
