"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a high price, hoping to leave room for negotiation and secure a good deal.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm indicating a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has some leverage. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is a high opening offer. Bob is unlikely to accept it.
* My goal is to start the negotiation process and see where it goes.
* I'm keeping the option to sell to John in mind as a fallback plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value is closer to $1000000. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than my desired profit. 
* **More Negotiating Room:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.  By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Value of the Product:**  I need to remind Bob of the true value of the product and why a higher price is justified.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price but still leaves room for negotiation. I will be mindful of the time limit and John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, however, and I'm offering you the product for $1,750,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's potential and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer and express my willingness to compromise. 
* **Justification:**  I reiterate the value of the product and why my price is still fair.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I make it clear that this price is a compromise and I'm open to further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired profit margin while still being reasonable enough to keep the deal alive. My goal is to find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering the product's potential, I think a fair price would be around $1400000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already in round 4, and I need to be mindful of the limited negotiation rounds. 
* **Risk of Losing John's Deal:**  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk losing John's offer altogether.

**Decision:**  

Accepting Bob's offer will secure a sale and ensure I receive a reasonable profit. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good outcome considering the circumstances."
