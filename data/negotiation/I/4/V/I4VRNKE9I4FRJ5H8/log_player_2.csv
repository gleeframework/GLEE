Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can do better.  He has a lot of room to negotiate down from $1,500,000, and Alice is clearly motivated to sell."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his ideal price, he still has room to negotiate further. He can likely get it for closer to $1,000,000 by continuing to counteroffer."
