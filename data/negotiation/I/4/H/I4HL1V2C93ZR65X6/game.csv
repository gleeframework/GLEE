"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still reflects the significant value this product holds.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of your product, but I have a budget in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still quite a bit below my desired price. Given the significant value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I can buy it from another seller for this price. It's a fair deal that saves us both time and effort.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,000,000 is still significantly less than what this product is worth. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
