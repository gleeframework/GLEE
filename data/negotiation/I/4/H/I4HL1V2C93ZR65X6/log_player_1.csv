"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and emphasizing the potential benefits of the deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message doesn't close the door to counteroffers, keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price and far below the value I know the product holds. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There is room to negotiate a price that's more advantageous to me. I believe I can get a better deal through further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I want to explore the possibility of getting closer to that price with Bob. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still reflects the significant value this product holds.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower but still profitable price:** I've reduced my price, demonstrating flexibility, but it's still well above Bob's initial offer and within my acceptable range.
* **Emphasize product value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm encouraging further negotiation with a cooperative message.

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  I'm hoping to reach a compromise that satisfies both parties.
* **Keep negotiations open:**  By not rejecting outright, I'm encouraging Bob to come up with a more realistic counteroffer. 
* **Keep selling to John as a backup option:**  I'm still prepared to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of your product, but I have a budget in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's an increase, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** I'm determined to get a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I'm aware that selling to John will guarantee me my minimum, but I'm hopeful that I can get a better deal with Bob through further negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a firm stance:**  I'm demonstrating that I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Encourage Bob to raise his offer:** I want to push Bob closer to a more acceptable price.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** I'm not giving up on getting a better deal with Bob, as long as it's within reason."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still quite a bit below my desired price. Given the significant value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:**  I've lowered my price again to show flexibility, but still maintain a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Open to agreement:**  My message encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer and reach an agreement.

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  I'm trying to narrow the gap between our desired prices.
* **Push for a better deal:**  I'm hoping that my willingness to compromise will encourage Bob to increase his offer further.
* **Avoid hasty decisions:**  I'm not rushing to sell to John just yet, as I believe a better deal with Bob is still possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I can buy it from another seller for this price. It's a fair deal that saves us both time and effort. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **I'm not desperate:**  I'm not pressured to sell immediately and can afford to hold out for a better price.
* **John is a viable alternative:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a firm stance:** I'm demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum.
* **Explore further negotiation:** I'm hoping to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price, even if it means more rounds of negotiation.
* **Protect my interests:**  I'm prioritizing getting the best possible price for my product, even if it means potentially selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,000,000 is still significantly less than what this product is worth.

Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```
