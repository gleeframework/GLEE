"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $190. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with your purchase.",190.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $175 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $185. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",185.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to budge any further, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $182. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",182.0,Alice,9,
