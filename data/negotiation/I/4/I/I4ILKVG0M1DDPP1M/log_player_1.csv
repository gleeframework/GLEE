Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, we can try to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still being significantly above his perceived value. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price, taking advantage of Bob's potential interest while having a safety net in John's offer."
