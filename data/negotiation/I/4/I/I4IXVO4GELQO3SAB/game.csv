"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and high demand, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering what you'll gain.  What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $18,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value that I'm not sure is fully reflected in your valuation. I'm willing to come down to $20,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find a solution, I can't go as low as $17,500.  Would you consider $19,000? This price reflects the value you're receiving while acknowledging your budget concerns.",19000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16,500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,6,
