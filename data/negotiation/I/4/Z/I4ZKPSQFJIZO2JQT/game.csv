"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
