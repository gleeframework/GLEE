Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 9500
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation if he's highly interested. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The message subtly implies you have other options if Bob declines, subtly increasing the offer's appeal.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject $9,500.  However, this strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
