Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $160. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum price. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than my minimum price, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $140 is still a little low for me. How about $155? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love this product."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $155 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $145. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is close to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer again, aiming to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm ready to make a final concession, but I can't go any lower than $148. This is a great price for a product you'll truly enjoy. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 148}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $148 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $142. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations are getting close to my minimum price, but Bob still seems unwilling to budge.  I've only got 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so I'll take the safe option and sell to him."
