"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher figure.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
