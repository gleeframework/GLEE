"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price reflects the value of the product while giving you room to make a profit. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll bring to the product.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's try $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential benefits for both of us. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while allowing you to make a strong return on your investment.  Let's finalize this deal!",1100000.0,Alice,7,
