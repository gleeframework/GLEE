Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $15000.,18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a fair price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me is at least $15000.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is at least $15000.",15500.0,Alice,5,
