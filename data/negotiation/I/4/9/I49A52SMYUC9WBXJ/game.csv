"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $15,500?  That's a fair price, considering the value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. While your product is appealing, $15,500 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could we potentially settle on $13,500? ",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $13,500 is still below what I'm willing to accept. To meet halfway, I'm prepared to drop my price to $14,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
