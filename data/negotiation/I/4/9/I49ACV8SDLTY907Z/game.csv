"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $180? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's my limit. Can you consider meeting me at that price?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $160? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145, and that's my final offer. Can you consider meeting me at that price?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $155? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",155.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I really like the product, but I'm not willing to pay $155. I'll meet you halfway between $145 and $155, which is $150. That's my final offer. Can you consider it?",150.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $150. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $155 and $150, which is $152.50. It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",152.5,Alice,9,

"I'm really close to walking away, Alice. I've already gone up to $150, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I've decided to take a chance and buy the product from John for $80. It's not the best deal, but I've reached my limit. Good luck with your sales, Alice!",80.0,Bob,10,
