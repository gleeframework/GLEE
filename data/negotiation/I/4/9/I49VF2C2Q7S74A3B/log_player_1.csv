Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal and worth considering."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still ensuring I get more than John's offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, bringing the final price closer to his maximum.
* **Time Value:** While I have a guaranteed offer from John, selling it quickly to Bob has its own value. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob and ensuring the sale happens swiftly."
