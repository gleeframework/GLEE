,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
