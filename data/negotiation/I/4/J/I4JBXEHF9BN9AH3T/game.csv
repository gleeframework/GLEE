"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering your product's value to you and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $875,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value to you and leaves some room for both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.
