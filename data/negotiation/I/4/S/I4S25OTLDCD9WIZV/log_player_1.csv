"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is an aggressive strategy, but it allows me to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to pay a premium. It also gives me room to negotiate downwards in the following rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm trying to gauge Bob's true value for the product and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $12,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating with him. There are still rounds left, and I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm further lowering my price to $16,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept. If he rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum. While I'm tempted to accept, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to squeeze out a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm countering with $14,500.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If Bob rejects this, I'll be forced to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time, and Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum threshold. To guarantee I get at least my minimum, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000."
