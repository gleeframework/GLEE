"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm asking for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice's offer is $13,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to counter-offer and see if you can get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.**  It's important to keep the option to buy from John open, but it's better to try and get a lower price from Alice if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic counteroffer:**  $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Friendly and respectful tone:**  A positive tone shows you're interested in a deal, but you're also firm about your price.
* **Focus on your willingness:** Emphasizing that you're ""willing to pay"" $10,000 subtly suggests you might be open to going a little higher if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $11,500 is still above your target of saving as much money as possible. 
* **There's still room to negotiate:**  You have 7 rounds left.  Even if Alice doesn't budge further, you could potentially agree on $12,000 by the end, which is still a decent saving.
* **Buying from John is still a backup:**  It's better to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise there."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:**  Offering $11,000 shows you're willing to meet halfway, but it's still a good saving compared to Alice's offer.
* **Emphasis on compromise:**  Highlighting your willingness to ""find a compromise"" reinforces the idea of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Positive but firm tone:**  The message is friendly but assertive, indicating you're serious about getting a fair price."
