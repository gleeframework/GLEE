Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but you also need to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of John's offer at $15,000 if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
