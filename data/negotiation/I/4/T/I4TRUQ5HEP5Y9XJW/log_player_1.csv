Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $100.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $105?  It's still a good deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to offer $100 for the product. This respects your need for a fair profit while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum price.  I'm happy to accept this and close the deal.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
