Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum selling price ($120). 
* **Create Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited time,"" we might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $119, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate down a bit.  

It's important to note that even if Bob rejects this offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John. This strategy prioritizes potentially maximizing profit from Bob."
