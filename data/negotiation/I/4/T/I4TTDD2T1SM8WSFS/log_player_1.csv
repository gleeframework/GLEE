Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $18,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to his counteroffer to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for anything below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is my absolute minimum price, but I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $15,000 is your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but he's getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to reach a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go down a bit more to $14,250. This is really close to my minimum, but I'm trying to make this work. Let's meet in the middle and close the deal."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. I'm starting to feel like we're not going to agree on a price that works for both of us. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000, which is my minimum price and ensures I don't lose money on this deal."
