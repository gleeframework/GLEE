Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price slightly.
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief justification can make the offer more appealing.  Mentioning the ""unique"" nature of the product and its potential value to Bob might make him more amenable to the higher price.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000.  This gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation."
