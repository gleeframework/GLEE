{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. It also positions me as a fair seller by highlighting the value he'll get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $10,000 is better than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I'm confident this is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and it's worth the risk of losing the deal by pushing for more. It's important to remember that I could always sell to John for $8,000."
