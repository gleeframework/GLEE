Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value it provides,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of his own high valuation of the product, potentially making him more amenable to the offer. 
* **Alternative:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $80, ensuring I don't settle for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than his perceived value and my initial offer.  I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to meet him closer to the middle ground while still aiming higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  It's a fair price considering the value you're getting."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Middle Ground:** $100 is a compromise that splits the difference between his offer ($90) and my previous offer ($110). 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the idea that $100 is a good deal. 
* **Alternative:** I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John for $80 if Bob remains firm at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** $95 is a solid profit above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield small increments, and there's a risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now saves time and allows me to move on to other potential sales. 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains seem outweighed by the risks of continued negotiation.  Accepting $95 ensures a good profit with minimal hassle."
