You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, so Alice's initial offer is too high. I will reject and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping she'll be willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price, but it's getting closer. I'll reject this offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to go all in and offer Alice my maximum price of $800,000.  If she rejects this, I'll have to go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $825,000. This is still a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer. Since I only have 5 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal by rejecting and potentially having Alice walk away completely. I'll accept the offer and save $75,000 compared to John's price."
