"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $900,000 is still a little steep for me. Could you do $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $900,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $850,000, and I'll throw in some additional support and services to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
