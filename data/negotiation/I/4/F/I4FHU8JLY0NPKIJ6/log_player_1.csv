Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John, as I want to maximize my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $175 is still below my absolute minimum, giving Bob some space to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to get a good price without immediately shutting down the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $85 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  While John offers a guaranteed $150, I still have room to negotiate with Bob.  I might be able to get a price closer to my desired range. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120?  This is still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $175 to $120, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $120 is still above my minimum of $150, but significantly lower than my initial offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to accept. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Guaranteed sale with John:**  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is significantly better than risking another round of negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob takes time and effort, and there's no guarantee that he'll eventually agree to my minimum price. 

Selling to John is the most efficient and profitable option at this point."
