"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also aware of other potential buyers who are interested.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go that low. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and it still leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we settle at $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still too low. It's getting close, though. How about we split the difference and go with $1,012,500? I believe that's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $990,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
