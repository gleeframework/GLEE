Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  A price of $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly less than its value to you ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have the time and resources to potentially negotiate with Bob. If you need to close the deal immediately, accepting John's offer is the safer choice."
