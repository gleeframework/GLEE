Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I am pleased to offer the product for $85. This is a reasonable price that reflects the quality and benefits the product provides. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85.  While you could risk it to try and get a lower price, there's a chance the negotiation could stall, and you'd end up paying John's $80 price anyway.  Accepting the $85 offer secures a decent price."
