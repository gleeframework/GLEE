"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Showing Flexibility:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** Mentioning the product's value to me subtly implies its worth and justifies the higher price.

**Note:** I'm not rushing to sell to John immediately. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  Selling to John would be a better choice at this point.
* **However, I'm not immediately selling to John. I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.**  I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get him to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my desire to sell quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm countering with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to reinforce its worth and justify my price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I subtly mention wanting to sell quickly to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  This is a good deal for me considering the limited time and the risk of not getting a better offer from Bob.
* **Selling to John for $12,000 would be better, but there's a chance I could get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.**  However, the risk of getting a lower offer or no offer at all is too high.
* **Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price.** 

By accepting this offer, I minimize my risk while still achieving my minimum financial goal."
