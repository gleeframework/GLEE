"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is a bit high. There's room to negotiate for a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you halfway at $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll try pushing a bit further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 97
}
```

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between the previous offer ($105) and our initial counteroffer ($90). It keeps the negotiation moving while inching closer to a desirable price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure $97 is quite fair, considering the product's value to me. I can do $102, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good deal for both of us, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is holding firm, and $102 is a reasonable price, saving us $18 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
