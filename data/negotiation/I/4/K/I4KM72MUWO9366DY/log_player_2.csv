(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I'm looking to save as much money as I can, and $120 is a bit too steep for me. Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 80}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get an even better price. Here's my counteroffer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 95}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's make a final compromise at $100.  That's a fair price for both of us and will get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","It looks like Alice is trying to get me to accept her offer at the price I was looking for all along. I'll reject her offer and stick to my original plan to try to get a better price. However, since Alice's offer is now at $100, which is the same price as what John is offering, I'll consider buying from John instead.
