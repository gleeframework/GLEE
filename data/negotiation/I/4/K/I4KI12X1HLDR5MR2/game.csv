"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $75 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking that the product is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $82. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and pay $77 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",77.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer again! I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $77. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $81. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",81.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still not willing to budge on the price, but I'm not willing to pay $81 either. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $78. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me halfway this time. Can you consider this offer?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $78. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $79. It's the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",79.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable paying $79. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm not willing to pay more. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and consider buying the product from John for $150. Thank you for the negotiation, but I think it's time for me to move on.",150.0,Bob,8,
