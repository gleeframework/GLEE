Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing John provides a guaranteed $1,500,000, Alice can confidently start negotiations above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Room for negotiation:** The $1,350,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for Alice (and above Bob's $1,000,000 valuation).
* **Strategic message:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly hinting at its high demand without revealing John's offer.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to maximize Alice's profit by:

1. **Potentially securing a deal with Bob above his valuation:** If Bob values the ""exclusive opportunity"" or other intangible benefits, he might accept a price closer to $1,350,000.
2. **Using John's offer as a safety net:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can proceed with selling to John at her desired price."
