"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, I'm setting a high anchor. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it might influence his counteroffer to be closer to my desired range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $2,000,000 offer leaves ample space to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, it's strategically better to try and secure a higher price from Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant move, it's still above his perceived value of the product. I believe there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm aiming for a higher price while keeping the door open for him to improve his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. While $2,000,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate, but only by a small amount ($100,000).
* **Meeting Halfway (Approximately):**  Positioning the counteroffer as ""meeting in the middle"" creates an illusion of fairness, even though it's slightly skewed in my favor. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** $1,900,000 is still a substantial profit margin above my minimum and significantly more than Bob's valuation. 
* **Time Consideration:** While I have rounds remaining, it's good to make progress. This offer maintains pressure on Bob while giving him a chance to accept a still-favorable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to consider your latest offer. However, I must respectfully decline $1,900,000. My final counteroffer is $1,750,000. I hope this proposal will allow us to move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,750,000 is a significant profit above my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **""Final Counteroffer"":** Bob's language suggests he's unlikely to go higher. Holding out further risks losing the deal. 
* **Time and Risk:** While I have rounds remaining, continuing negotiations introduces uncertainty. Accepting now guarantees a very good outcome. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could theoretically push for more, the potential gain is likely smaller than the risk of Bob walking away, forcing me to accept John's lower offer."
