# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $80. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's a great investment for you. Would you like to make this purchase at the special introductory price of $75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer of $75 is less than your maximum budget of $80, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $80."
