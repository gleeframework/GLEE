{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, acknowledging its value but reflecting my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential ROI for your business.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a stretch.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you're passionate about this product, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm offering $1,300,000 as a serious compromise. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
