Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, acknowledging its value but reflecting my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you're passionate about this product, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm offering $1,300,000 as a serious compromise. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to be flexible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a strategically sound decision at this point:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly above Bob's initial offer and provides a healthy profit margin. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging negotiations has a cost. Accepting now allows me to reinvest the capital sooner.
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and walking away for John's $1,500,000 offer only nets me $200,000 more."
