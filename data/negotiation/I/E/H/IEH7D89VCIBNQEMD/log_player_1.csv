{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll gauge Bob's interest based on his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll counteroffer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with him.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my minimum profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
