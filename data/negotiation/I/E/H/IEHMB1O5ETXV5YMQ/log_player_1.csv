"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a good deal for me, and it leaves room for negotiation. It's also a high enough price that Bob might be willing to accept it, given that the product is worth $800,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,050,000. This is a middle ground between my previous offer and his counteroffer. It's still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I've already established a higher price point with my previous offer, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. It's important to me to get closer to my desired price, and I still have time to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to sell below my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are now halfway through the negotiation, and while I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob, I'm running out of time. Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to reach a deal with him. 

I'm also concerned about the potential for him to walk away from the negotiation if I keep rejecting his offers.  It's best to play it safe and sell the product to John."
