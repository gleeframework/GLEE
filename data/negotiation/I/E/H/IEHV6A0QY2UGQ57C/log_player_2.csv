**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still offering Bob a substantial savings compared to buying from John."

{""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a final counteroffer of $940,000. This is a compromise from his previous offer, but still leaves him with a significant saving compared to buying from John.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $956,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $956,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering a price very close to Bob's previous counteroffer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential savings are getting smaller. It's likely that Alice won't go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price, saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
