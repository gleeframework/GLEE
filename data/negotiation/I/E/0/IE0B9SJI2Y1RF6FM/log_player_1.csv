"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic but Realistic:**  $14,000 is a good starting point, allowing for some potential compromise without immediately jeopardizing my minimum goal of $15,000.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive and friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer and keeps the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum desired value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob is showing interest, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my desired profit, but I'm willing to explore further negotiation with Bob, hoping to potentially get closer to my target.  

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm lowering my price slightly but still staying above my minimum goal. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially swaying him towards accepting.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $13,500 leaves room for another potential compromise if Bob counteroffers again. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while positioning me to potentially secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,250. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $13,250 is still below my minimum desired value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I am willing to negotiate, there's still a significant gap between our desired prices. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my desired profit, but I am willing to see if I can get closer to that amount through further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,400. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. I'm hoping we can reach a deal soon."", ""product_price"": 13400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm making a small counteroffer, increasing the price slightly from Bob's last offer but still below my initial goal. This strategy shows flexibility while also signaling my desire to close the deal.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness by reiterating the value of the product and referencing our previous discussions. This can help create a sense of momentum towards an agreement.
* **Closing Intent:** I'm expressing a desire to reach a deal soon, subtly pressuring Bob to accept or make a more reasonable counteroffer. 

This counteroffer is aimed at finding a middle ground and potentially closing the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13,400, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,300, but no higher. Can you consider my revised offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,300

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $13,300 is still below my minimum target of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially secure a better price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I'm willing to take a risk to try and close a deal with Bob at a price closer to my initial goal.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,300 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $13,350, which is a fair compromise considering our previous negotiations. It's a great price for this valuable product, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal soon."", ""product_price"": 13350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Counteroffer:**  I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, signaling my desire to close the deal while staying above my minimum goal.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,350, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,325, but no higher. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $13,325 is still below my minimum desired value of $15,000. 
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:** With only two rounds remaining, there's very little room for further negotiation.  It's unlikely I can get Bob to significantly increase his offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John guarantees my desired profit of $15,000.  The risk of continuing with Bob is too high.

It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed profit from John."
