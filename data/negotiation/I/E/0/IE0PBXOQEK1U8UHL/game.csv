"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let me know if this is something you'd like to accept.",875000.0,Alice,5,
