"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to come close to my desired price.  This is a good starting point to gauge his interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit. I believe this offer is still attractive to Bob, as it's significantly lower than his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still too low.  While John is a safe option at $1,000,000, I believe I can get a better price from Bob with more negotiation. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm  lowering the price again to show that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target. This offer is a middle ground between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Negotiations with Bob are getting increasingly frustrating, and his offers keep dropping.  While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, the risk of him continuing to go lower is too high.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and secure the deal."
