"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is fair, considering its value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than the $15,000 you'd pay John. This means you save $3,000 by accepting Alice's offer, achieving your goal of buying the product while saving as much money as possible."
