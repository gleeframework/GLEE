"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $950,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, $850,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
