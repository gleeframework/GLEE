"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is less than what you'd pay John, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($100).  Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay John $100, but you'll still be getting a product that's worth $100 to you."
