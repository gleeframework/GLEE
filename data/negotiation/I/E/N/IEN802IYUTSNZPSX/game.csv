"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000?  That's still a great price for the value you'll be getting.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,035,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1035000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,035,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll offer $1,030,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,030,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer the product for $1,032,500.  It's a small difference, but it makes a significant impact for me.  I'm confident you'll still find this a great value.",1032500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm really at my limit. I'm willing to go up to $1,028,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one more time.",1028000.0,Bob,8,
