"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about we split the difference at $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original offer, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $7,800 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,200? I think that would be a fair price considering the value of this product for you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
