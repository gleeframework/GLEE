"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is far too high. It's more than double what the product is worth to Bob.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a lower price but not go so low that it seems unreasonable or offensive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still significantly more than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  Bob is still better off than buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000.  Alice is likely willing to sell for less than $15,000.  This offer is a compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget, but Bob is still better off negotiating with her than buying from John.  There's still a chance Alice might drop her price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000.  This offer is still lower than Alice's current offer, but it's closer to the middle ground.  Alice might be willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation or the risk of Bob buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, there are only a few rounds left.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down to Bob's price, and at this point, it's better to secure the product for $10,000 from John."
