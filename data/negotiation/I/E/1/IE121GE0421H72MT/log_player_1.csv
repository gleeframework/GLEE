Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  This gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept, as he stands to make a profit.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** This shows that you value the product and aren't afraid to ask for a good price. 

By starting with a strong opening offer, you increase your chances of getting a price closer to your goal of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is above my minimum, it's still below my desired price, and Bob seems willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,375,000? This would allow me to get closer to my desired price while still being fair to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** Shows that I'm not willing to settle for his initial offer.
* **It's lower than my previous offer:**  Demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation and willing to move.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Makes my intentions clear and encourages a swift response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,325,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is sticking to his $1,300,000 offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and a significant profit.  Further negotiation might be time-consuming and doesn't guarantee a better result.  It's best to accept his offer and move on."
