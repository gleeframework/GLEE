"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round makes sense.  Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or consider buying from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I'm not able to go that high.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating.  He can either try to counteroffer again or explore the option of buying from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  This price reflects the product's value to me, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer of $1,025,000 is still slightly above Bob's budget. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of her continuing to reject offers, and the limited rounds may not leave enough time to reach an agreeable price.  Buying from John guarantees the purchase within Bob's budget."
