"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I've priced it at $1,200,000, reflecting its worth and potential for your business.  This price gives us both a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still provides a significant value for you while allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your price. How about $1,050,000?  That demonstrates my serious interest while still fitting within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  This offer is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while allowing us to reach an agreement. ",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect that.  To be honest, $1,075,000 is a little too close to my absolute limit. How about we settle this right now at $1,060,000? That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,060,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,065,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1065000.0,Alice,7,
