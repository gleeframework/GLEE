Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I've priced it at $1,200,000, reflecting its worth and potential for your business.  This price gives us both a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. $1,000,000 is still too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still provides a significant value for you while allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your price. How about $1,050,000?  That demonstrates my serious interest while still fitting within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,100,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  This offer is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while allowing us to reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect that.  To be honest, $1,075,000 is a little too close to my absolute limit. How about we settle this right now at $1,060,000? That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,060,000, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my target price of $1,100,000. With only 4 rounds left, I need to make the most of each negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,060,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,065,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1065000}
