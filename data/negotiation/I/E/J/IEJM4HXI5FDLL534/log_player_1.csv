"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell at that price. I believe the product holds more value, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point. I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a good profit margin."
