Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Strategic Offer:**  The price is high enough that Bob might be willing to negotiate, but not so high that he'll immediately reject the offer outright. 
* **Plan B:**  I have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if Bob doesn't agree, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with him at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can secure it for a lower price elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering the minimum he's willing to pay, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** Even though Bob is a potential buyer, his offer is too low. There's a chance I can negotiate a better price with him or sell to John for a higher price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer and try to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my previous offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Appeal to Logic:** I'm appealing to Bob's logic by highlighting that this offer is still a good deal for him, while also being closer to my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Again, I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept the counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll still have the option of selling to John for $15,000 or making another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our positions, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is only $500 lower than my minimum acceptable price of $11,500. This is a small difference, and accepting the offer allows me to avoid further negotiation.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to more rounds, wasting time and effort. 
* **Potential for Future Business:** Accepting the offer could build a positive relationship with Bob for potential future deals. 
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John for $15,000 is more profitable, it's not guaranteed that I'll have a similar opportunity in the future with John."
