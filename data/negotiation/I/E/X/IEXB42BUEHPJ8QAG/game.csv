"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1090000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm confident that a price of $1065000 would be a win-win for both of us. It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also allowing us to close this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1065000.0,Bob,6,
