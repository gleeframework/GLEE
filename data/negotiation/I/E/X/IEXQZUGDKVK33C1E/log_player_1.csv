Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), it makes sense to start with a higher offer to Bob. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $175 allows for a potential $25 profit. This price is not excessively high that it would immediately deter Bob, especially if the perceived value of the product is well-communicated.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision faster. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your knowledge of Bob (e.g., his negotiation style, how much he might value the product) and your risk tolerance, you could adjust the initial offer and messaging."
