"I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it. I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $15,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more to $14,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,6,
