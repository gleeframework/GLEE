{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers and also shows him that I value the product. I'm confident that I can sell to John for $15,000 if Bob rejects my offer, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it. I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $15,500? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer. This shows good faith and signals that I'm serious about making a deal. It's also above my minimum acceptable value, so I'm still in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a price closer to $15,000.  I'm confident that I can either get a better offer from Bob or sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more to $14,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm taking a small step closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum value. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but not at the cost of my own needs.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a final counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been firm at $14,000, and while that's not terrible, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $15,000, so I'm going to sell to him and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
