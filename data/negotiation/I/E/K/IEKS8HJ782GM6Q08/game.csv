"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of that.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
