"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob needs to start with a price lower than Alice's offer to show he's serious about negotiating.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's price but still allows for some potential profit for Alice. This makes it a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer.
* **Clear Communication:** The message explains Bob's position and expresses interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of that.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Position:** Alice is unwilling to come down as far as Bob would like, but she's shown some flexibility.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While buying from John would be the safest option, Bob might be able to get a better price from Alice with continued negotiation.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Bob should try to squeeze out a bit more savings before resorting to John.  There's still room for both parties to find a price that works."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Bob is staying firm in his goal to save money, but he's not making a huge jump in his counteroffer. This keeps the conversation open.
* **Fair Compromise:** The $1,100,000 offer is a relatively small difference from Alice's last offer, making it seem more reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** Bob maintains a positive tone while still making his position clear, showing that he's open to reaching an agreement."
