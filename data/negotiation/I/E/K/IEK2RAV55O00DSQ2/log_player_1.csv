"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,000? That's a fair price for the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 simply won't work for me. It's important for me to get a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to go up to $11,000?

I'm going to sell to John. Bob is offering me $9,000, which is below my minimum. While I'm open to negotiating further, it's getting late in the game, and John is offering me my minimum price. It's best to take the sure thing and sell to John."
