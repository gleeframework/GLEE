"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would give us both a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,500 is still a bit more than I can afford at this time.  Would you consider $12,000?  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
