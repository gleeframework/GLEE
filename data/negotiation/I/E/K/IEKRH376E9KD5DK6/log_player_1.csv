Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value to leave some room for negotiation. I believe Bob is motivated to buy the product, but the $1,500,000 minimum gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I still have some room to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too far below my minimum. I'm not willing to go that low, and I'm confident I can sell the product to John for a much better price."
