"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $1,000,000 to me. However, I'm not ready to pay $900,000 just yet. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is a fair price considering your own value for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider it. After some thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
