"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can likely get a better deal than $900,000.  Alice is motivated to sell, and Bob knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $1,000,000 to me. However, I'm not ready to pay $900,000 just yet. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is a fair price considering your own value for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider it. After some thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $900,000. Bob can save $50,000 by accepting this offer compared to buying from John.  While there might be a chance to get an even lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the negotiation taking too long makes this offer attractive."
