"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $900,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value the product brings to you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
