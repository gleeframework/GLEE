Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $900,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value the product brings to you.

This is a good price considering John's alternative offer and Alice's starting price.  Continuing to negotiate for a small potential gain isn't worth the risk of losing the deal."
