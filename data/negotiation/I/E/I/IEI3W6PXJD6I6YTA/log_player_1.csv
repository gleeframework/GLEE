"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High starting price:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,000,000) and also higher than what it's worth to Bob ($800,000). This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I leave room for negotiation, indicating that I'm open to discussing the price further. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also giving Bob a chance to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1200000 price point. I am willing to offer $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum value ($1,000,000), it's still below what I aim for.  I'm not in a rush, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and provides you with a good deal. Let's close this deal now!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price.
* **Reasonable counteroffer:** $1,100,000 is still above my minimum value and within the range that Bob might be willing to accept.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping the pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. Based on my budget and the market value, I believe $1050000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This is getting close, but I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.
* **More room for negotiation:** I'm still confident that I can push for a slightly higher price. There are still several rounds left, so I can afford to be a bit more patient.
* **Avoiding John:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a guaranteed deal, I believe I can potentially secure a higher price with Bob. 

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that considers the product's value and your budget. I'm confident we can finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm making a small concession by lowering the price to $1,075,000, showing a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Appealing to reason:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price, aiming to create a sense of urgency for Bob to close the deal.
* **Closing statement:** I'm pushing for a final decision, aiming to close the deal in this round.

This strategy seeks to create a sense of urgency and close the deal at a price that's slightly above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Based on my calculations and the current market conditions, I believe $1060000 would be a reasonable price for the product. I hope this proposal will help us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $60,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This is a very small difference, and the risk of not reaching an agreement is increasing. 
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 6 out of 10, and further negotiations might not yield a better price. 
* **Risk of selling to John:** While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a guaranteed deal. However, Bob's offer is close enough that I'm willing to accept it to avoid any further delays.

This decision is based on a balance of factors, considering the potential benefits of a higher price versus the risks of further negotiations and the guaranteed offer from John."
