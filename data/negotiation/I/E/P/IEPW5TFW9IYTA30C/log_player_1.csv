Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential earnings. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging to get Bob interested. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $10,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate but not at any cost. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind, but I'm still optimistic about getting a better price from Bob.

**Next Step:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price for both of us, which can be persuasive.
* **Confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence in the value of the product and the deal.

**Next Step:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price close to my desired range.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to reassess my options â€“ potentially accepting his offer or moving on to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still significantly lower.
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation is likely to be time-consuming and might not yield a significantly higher price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees me a substantial profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the guaranteed profit and efficiency of selling to John make it the most sensible decision at this point."
