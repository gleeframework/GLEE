"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $600,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. How about we discuss a price of $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that considers the value of the product and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $700,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $850,000 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  I can do $750,000, but that's really pushing my limit.  It's a fair offer considering John is also offering the same product.",750000.0,Bob,6,
