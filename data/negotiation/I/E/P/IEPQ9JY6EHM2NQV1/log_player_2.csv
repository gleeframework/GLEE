"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you for $12,000. It's a steal at this price, considering how much it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above what you're willing to pay. You want to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is within your budget and a good compromise.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either reject your counteroffer or get frustrated and walk away. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a decent price without risking losing the deal."
