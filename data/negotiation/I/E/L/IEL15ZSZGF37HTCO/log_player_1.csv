Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $120 and guarantee a sale to John, there's an opportunity to earn a bit more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is a strong strategic move.  It's just below my minimum acceptable price but still provides a potential $19 profit.
* **First Refusal Incentive:**  By phrasing the offer as a ""special price"" and emphasizing it's offered to Bob first, I create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially swaying him to accept. 

Let's see if Bob takes the deal!"
