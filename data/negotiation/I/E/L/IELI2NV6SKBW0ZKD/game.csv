"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but  $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, and that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",795000.0,Alice,5,,
