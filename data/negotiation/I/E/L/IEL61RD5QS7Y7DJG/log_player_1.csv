{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong price point, leaving room for negotiation while still being profitable for me.  I'm also being positive and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 just doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250, which is a fair compromise. This is a very valuable product, and I'm confident you'll see the value in investing in it at this price. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to offer $9,800, which is my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is close to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to go a bit higher.  I'm not quite ready to give up on this deal yet, and I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,000, which is a great price for this high-quality product.  It's my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is my absolute limit. If you can meet me at this price, I'll close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still quite a bit below my minimum acceptable price, and with only two rounds left, I'm not sure I can get him to budge any further.  It's better to sell to John for $15,000 and guarantee a much higher profit."
