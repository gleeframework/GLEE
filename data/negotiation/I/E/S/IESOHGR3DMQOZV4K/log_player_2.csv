"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $170.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above my budget and what I value the product at. It's worth seeing if she'll come down significantly in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming low to give myself room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $80 maximum. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it opens up the negotiation and allows her to counter.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand that my initial price might seem a bit high, but I assure you this product is of excellent quality. How about we meet in the middle somewhere?  Would you consider $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down a little, $140 is still significantly more than my $80 limit.
* **Slow Progress:** Her counter-offer suggests she might not be willing to go down to a price I'm comfortable with quickly.
* **John is an Option:** It's good to keep in mind I have a backup option with John at $80 if negotiations with Alice stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $140 is still more than I'm looking to spend. To be honest, I have a budget in mind, and I'd be willing to go up to $70 for it.  That's a fair offer considering the going rate for similar products."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, But Within Budget:** I've increased my offer to $70, showing Alice I'm willing to move, but I'm staying firmly within my $80 budget.
* **Justification:** By mentioning my budget and comparing to similar products, I'm giving Alice reasons to consider my offer seriously.
* **Time Pressure:**  As rounds progress, Alice might become more willing to negotiate to avoid losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems we are both serious about making a deal here.  While $70 is still a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $115. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, and she's unlikely to move much from $115.
* **Over Budget:** Even with her concession, $115 is still significantly over my $80 maximum.
* **John's Price is Fair:** Knowing I can get the product for $80 from John makes continuing the negotiation with Alice not worthwhile."
