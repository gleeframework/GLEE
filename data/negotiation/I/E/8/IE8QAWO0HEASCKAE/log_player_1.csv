{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make you a fair offer.  I'm asking $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $950,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a significant advantage, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. I'd be willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my desired price and definitely higher than John's offer. This is a good deal, so I will accept."
