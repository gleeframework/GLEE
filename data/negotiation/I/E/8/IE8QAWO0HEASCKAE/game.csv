"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a significant advantage, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. I'd be willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
