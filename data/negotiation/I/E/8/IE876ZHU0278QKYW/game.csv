"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $13,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm on a tight budget. My final offer is $12,500.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go.",13000.0,Alice,7,
