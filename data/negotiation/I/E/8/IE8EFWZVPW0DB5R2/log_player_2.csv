"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, given its worth to you.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation and a potential to get a lower price. 
* **No immediate urgency:** Bob has the option to buy from John, so he doesn't need to rush into a decision.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can start the counter-offer process and try to get a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000 for this product.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. Could we agree on $13,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he still believes he can get a better deal.  
* **No immediate need:**  Bob can still buy from John if he doesn't reach an agreement with Alice.

By rejecting, Bob can continue the negotiation and try to get the price down even further."
