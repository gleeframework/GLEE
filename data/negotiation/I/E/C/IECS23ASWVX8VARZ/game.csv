"I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's capabilities and potential benefits to my business. I'm willing to move forward with the purchase at this price.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600000 doesn't fully reflect the product's true value and potential for your business. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This price still allows for a significant profit margin for you while ensuring a fair return on my investment. I'm confident this product will deliver exceptional results, exceeding your expectations.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product and its potential benefits to my business.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $725000 still doesn't quite meet my expectations for this exceptional product.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm prepared to go down to $775000. This price represents a fair compromise, allowing you to realize the product's full value while providing me with a reasonable return.  I believe this offer reflects the potential of this product for your business and hope you'll consider it.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $775000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $750000, which I believe is a fair price for the product's value and potential benefits to my business.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and we're clearly getting closer to a deal.  While $750000 is tempting, it's just a little short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm prepared to go down to $760000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and it still provides you with a great deal on a product that will deliver tremendous value to your business. Let's close this deal and move forward together!",760000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid $760000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $750000, as I mentioned before. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value and potential benefits to my business. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",750000.0,Bob,8,
