Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me.

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.

While I'd ideally like to get more, Bob has signaled this is his final offer. Accepting $1,080,000 is a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of losing him entirely."
