"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I'd consider. This product offers you a unique advantage, and I'm confident it can generate much more value for you in the long run.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the value I can derive from the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer.  How about we settle on $1,150,000? This reflects the significant value the product holds, while recognizing your initial investment.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
