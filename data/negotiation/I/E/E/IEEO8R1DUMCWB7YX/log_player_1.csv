"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer, as I am aiming for a higher price. Although his counteroffer is better than John's price, I have 8 rounds left and can potentially secure a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than John's offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $10,875? This would allow us both to secure a good deal. Let's try to finalize this, as we're running out of time."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're running out of time, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,875. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $10,750 again. I think this is the best I can do, and I hope you can meet me at this price. Let's try to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the highest he's offered, and while it's less than my ideal price, it's still a better deal than selling to John. With only 4 rounds left, I'm accepting Bob's offer to ensure a sale and avoid risking getting a lower offer from John."
