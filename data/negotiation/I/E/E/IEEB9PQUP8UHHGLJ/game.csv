"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000.

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the benefits the product can bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
