You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for significantly less."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,000 is a bit closer to his budget, it's still more than he's comfortable paying. He can get the same product from John for $8,000, which is much closer to his target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's just a little over my budget and allows us both to make a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise at $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice is willing to go down to $12,000, that's still above Bob's target price. Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it makes more sense for Bob to buy from John and save the extra $4,000."
