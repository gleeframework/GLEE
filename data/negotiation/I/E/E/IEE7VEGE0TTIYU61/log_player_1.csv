Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how serious Bob is about the product and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price, giving you leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both your minimum acceptable price and your initial offer.  While you want to find a mutually agreeable price, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.  You have room to negotiate, and you know John is waiting in the wings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. I could consider a price of $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above Bob's offer and your absolute minimum.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief explanation about the product's value reinforces your position without being overly aggressive.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You still have the option to walk away and sell to John, giving you a strong position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,275,000?  That seems like a fair price that we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is above your absolute minimum of $1,200,000 and a reasonable compromise. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk that Bob walks away. Securing a deal now has value.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting a reasonable compromise can help build goodwill for potential future interactions with Bob."
