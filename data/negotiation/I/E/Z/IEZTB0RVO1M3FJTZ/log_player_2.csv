"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a substantial opportunity, as this product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. Even though the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob,  saving $100,000 is a significant advantage."
