"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. My initial offer for the product is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's a good start! Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her, and we can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get closer to the product's true value, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. My counteroffer is $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving any value on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

Alice is still offering a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to her. We can still push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too far from my target.  How about $1,120,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise and lets us both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're still a bit above my initial target, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to our desired price. While we could continue to negotiate, it's likely that she won't budge much further. Accepting her offer allows us to save $100,000 compared to buying from John."
