I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is too low for me, even though I'm trying to sell the product. I'm going to counteroffer."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Bob's offers are getting closer to my bottom line, but I'm not confident we'll be able to reach an agreement. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
