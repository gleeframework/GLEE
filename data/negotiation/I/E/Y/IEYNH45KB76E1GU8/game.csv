"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe this product could be beneficial, the price point is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
