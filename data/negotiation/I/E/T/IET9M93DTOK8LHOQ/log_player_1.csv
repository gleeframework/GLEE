Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also being friendly and confident in my offer to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation. How about we discuss a price of $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can negotiate a higher price. I still have time to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the current market conditions and similar products available, I would like to propose a price of $825,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Given the limited rounds, I'm going to accept his offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
