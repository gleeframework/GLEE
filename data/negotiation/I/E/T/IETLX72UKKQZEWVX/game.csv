"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $900,000?  This would still be a great price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
