Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I'm eager to sell, I need to ensure I get a fair return."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $900,000?  This would still be a great price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I see the value, I'm still aiming for something closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
