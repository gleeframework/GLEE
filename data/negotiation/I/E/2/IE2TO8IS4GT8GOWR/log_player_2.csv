Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

While $1,250,000 is better than $1,500,000, it's still above your budget.  Let's try to negotiate further."

This offer is still within your budget but closer to Alice's previous offer.  Hopefully, it will entice her to come down a bit more."
