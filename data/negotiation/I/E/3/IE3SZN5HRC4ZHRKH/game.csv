"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $880,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $880,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $825,000.  Let's make it happen!",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I can meet you halfway between $825,000 and $880,000, which would be $852,500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",852500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $852,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $825,000.  I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,6,
