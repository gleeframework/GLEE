Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150 (its value to me), there's a chance Bob might decline.  Offering it slightly lower at $140 increases the likelihood of him accepting and me making a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit higher leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150 gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately sell to Bob below my minimum."
