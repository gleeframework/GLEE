Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher offer in negotiations.  This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $18,000, you set a high ""anchor"" point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to your desired price than if you started lower.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Value Justification:** While not explicitly stated, the message hints at the product's value, justifying the higher price.

It's important to note: This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in your pricing and are willing to potentially negotiate with Bob."
