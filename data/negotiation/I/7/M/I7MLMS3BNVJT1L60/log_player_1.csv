Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,000,000.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000.
* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired outcome but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me a solid fallback position if negotiations with Bob fail.

This initial offer allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob rejects this offer, it signals he's seriously interested in getting a lower price.
* **Negotiate from a strong position:** Starting high allows me to potentially negotiate down to a price closer to $1,400,000. 
* **Maximize my potential gains:**  There's a good chance I can secure a price closer to Bob's value, leading to a larger profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer indicates his willingness to negotiate further. I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering.
* **John is still a viable option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 by selling to John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and keep the possibility of a higher price open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My previous offer was $1,400,000, and Bob countered with $1,200,000. This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between our previous offers. 
* **Still within Bob's range:**  $1,300,000 is still below Bob's maximum value of $1,500,000, making it a reasonable proposition for him.
* **Maintaining my position:**  I'm not giving in too quickly, showing I'm firm on my value while being open to negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Encourage a deal:** It shows I'm willing to meet halfway, making a deal more likely.
* **Get closer to my desired price:** $1,300,000 is still closer to my ideal outcome than Bob's last offer. 
* **Keep John as a backup:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still fall back on selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations are stalling:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum but still isn't ideal. 
* **Risk of further decline:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he'll counter with an even lower price in the next round.
* **John provides certainty:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable amount.

At this point, the potential for a better deal with Bob is uncertain. It's safer to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
