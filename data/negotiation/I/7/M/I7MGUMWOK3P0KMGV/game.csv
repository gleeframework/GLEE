"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1400000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1350000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll derive from the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
