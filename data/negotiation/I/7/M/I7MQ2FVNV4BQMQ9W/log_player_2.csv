"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. You can leverage the fact that John is willing to sell for the same price.  By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If you're unsuccessful, you have the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $80?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point, offering a significant discount while still showing interest in the product.  It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer but also allows you to gauge her willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This is a great product that's worth the investment.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, and while you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price.  Accepting her offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous option."
