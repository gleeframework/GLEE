"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your interest,  $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,112,500.  This price still reflects the significant value this product holds for you.",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  I appreciate your flexibility. How about $1,093,750?  That's splitting the difference, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1093750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,093,750 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle one more time at $1,103,125.  This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1103125.0,Alice,5,
