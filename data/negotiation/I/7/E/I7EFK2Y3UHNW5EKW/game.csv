"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I need to be closer to $1,400,000 for this to make sense on my end. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
