Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price point sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you start at $10,000, there might be a small margin for negotiation if Bob pushes back, but you know you have a safety net with John."
