"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product for my minimum price of $10,000. Bob may reject, but I know I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not afraid to hold firm on my initial offer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm still not willing to accept it.  I'll counter with a higher price, but I'm willing to move closer to his offer in hopes of closing the deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800. It's a bit closer to Bob's offer, but still within my acceptable range.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him, but I'm still prepared to walk away if he continues to lowball me."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still a bit too low for me.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a higher price, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I have to close the deal soon or I risk losing out on a better offer with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $9,600.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm still trying to get as much as I can. I'm also feeling the pressure of the limited rounds, so I'm willing to compromise a little more."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. He's still too low, and I'm getting nervous about running out of time. I'll counter with a slightly higher price, but I'm starting to seriously consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,400. I'm getting desperate. I'm running out of time and Bob is still a little bit low, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get any better. I think this is my final offer, and if he rejects it, I'm going to sell to John."

I'm going to sell to John. It's down to the wire and Bob is still refusing to budge. I can't risk losing out on the $10,000. I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a better deal, but I'm also relieved to have secured the sale."
