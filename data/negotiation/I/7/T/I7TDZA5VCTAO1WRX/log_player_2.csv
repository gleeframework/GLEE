"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John** ($12,000 vs. $15,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a lower price from Alice. 

You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her estimated value. This shows a willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I'm not immediately losing money.
* **Room for compromise:**  There's a $2,000 gap between my offer and Alice's initial price. This provides space for both of us to meet in the middle. 
* **Avoiding John's price:** This counteroffer is still significantly cheaper than buying from John, ensuring I'm maximizing potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still better than John's:** $11,500 is a significant saving compared to $15,000. 
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  While a lower price is always desirable, the $500 difference between Alice's offer and my previous counteroffer might not be enough to justify another round of negotiation.  There's a risk Alice might reject my counteroffer again, leaving me with John's higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product for a price I'm comfortable with and avoid the risk of a failed negotiation."
