Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far too high for his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. He should try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and even though she says it's her best offer, there's no guarantee she won't try to raise the price again. Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $8,000, it's the smartest move to go with that option."
