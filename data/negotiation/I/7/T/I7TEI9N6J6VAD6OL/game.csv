"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $750,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value it brings to my business.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product for $815,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
