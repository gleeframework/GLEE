Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $1,125,000?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,125,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's close this deal at this price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
