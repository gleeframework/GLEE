Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $20,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we have a strong alternative with John at $15,000.  Starting with a high offer allows room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message hints at potential benefits without revealing our bottom line. This approach aims to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk Bob might outright reject the offer. However, it's a calculated risk, as we have a guaranteed sale with John.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it or negotiates, Alice can adjust her price accordingly, always keeping in mind her $15,000 safety net with John."
