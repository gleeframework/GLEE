"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, as it's worth $150 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is close to my maximum price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her value for the product. This strategy aims to leave room for negotiation while trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  That still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down in price, but I think there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

I'm offering a price that matches Alice's value for the product. This is a strong offer and a good compromise. It allows me to save money while still being fair to Alice."
