"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's better to start by rejecting Alice's offer. There's no need to pay more than $1,000,000 for the product, and you can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit,  I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice is now offering the product for the same price that John is selling it for. It makes sense to accept this offer as there's no benefit in continuing the negotiation."
