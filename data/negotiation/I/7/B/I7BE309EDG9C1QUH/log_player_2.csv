"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. I believe it's a fair price given its value and potential.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still within the range where negotiation is worthwhile. Bob can potentially save more money by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you valuing the product at $1,000,000. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
