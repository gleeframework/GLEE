Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This leaves a good amount of profit for me while still being a good deal for Bob as he values the product at $1,200,000. 

By starting with a high offer, I can gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a higher final price. However, I'm also mindful of John's offer of $1,000,000, which serves as my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is still a good amount of money, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,150,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to meet Bob halfway."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,125,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. This offer is still above my floor price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant portion of profit."

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close enough to my desired price and ensures a good profit. I've been through a few rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that Bob won't budge much further.  Accepting his offer avoids the risk of further negotiation and ensures a quick sale."
