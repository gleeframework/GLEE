"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its potential. Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focusing on the potential of the product.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  By offering a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price, I'm leaving room for negotiation and potentially reaching a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for better deal:**  I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price, given Bob's initial interest. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I'll keep John as a backup option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to be closer to $1,600,000 to make this work.  Let's keep talking and see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, decreasing my price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Staying above minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out on value.
* **Positive and open tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone, expressing willingness to continue the discussion and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,500,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This is as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is a factor:** We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid going through more rounds if I can get a decent deal. 
* **Uncertainty with John:** While John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's no guarantee that I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds with Bob. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though this is a slightly lower price than I initially wanted, I could potentially build a relationship with Bob and potentially do business with him in the future."
