"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to you. This product is not just any item; it's a testament to excellence and craftsmanship, tailored to meet your specific needs and desires. Given its significance to you, I understand its worth to be $1,000,000.

As the owner of this remarkable product, my primary goal is to ensure that it finds the right home where it can be appreciated and utilized to its full potential. With this in mind, I am extending to you an exclusive offer to purchase the product at a price that reflects its true value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.

I am proposing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This price is slightly below its market value but still offers a substantial return on investment for me, while providing you with a significant discount compared to its worth. I believe this is a fair deal that respects both our interests.

Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. If you have any questions or require additional information about the product, I would be more than happy to provide you with detailed insights.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While Alice's offer is higher than her personal value ($800,000), it's still significantly lower than what John is offering ($1,000,000). 
* **You save money.**  Accepting Alice's offer means saving $50,000 compared to buying from John."
