{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price of $120, but not so high that it's likely to immediately scare Bob off. 

I'll be watching Bob's response closely to see if he's interested and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is too low for me, as it falls below my minimum price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's still above my minimum price. I'm hoping that this will be a reasonable price for Bob, and that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $110 is above my minimum price of $120.  It's also a significant improvement over his previous offer.  I'm accepting his offer to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
