"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers exceptional value, even at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget.
* **Significant Gap:** The $6,000 offer creates a significant gap from Alice's initial price, encouraging her to negotiate.
* **Politeness:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 represents a fair price for its value, I understand your position. I could come down to $10,000, but that's my absolute lowest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down, but her offer is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. You have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $10,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Suggesting a price ""in the middle"" aims for a sense of fairness and compromise.
* **Target Range:**  $7,000 keeps the negotiation moving but is still within a reasonable distance of both your budget and John's offer. 
* **Openness:** The language remains open to further negotiation, signaling that you're serious about reaching a deal."
