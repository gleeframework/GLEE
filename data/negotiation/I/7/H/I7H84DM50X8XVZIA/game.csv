"Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $10000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this unique product. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $12500 is still a bit over my budget. I'm prepared to pay $11500, which is a fair price considering my willingness to negotiate. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
