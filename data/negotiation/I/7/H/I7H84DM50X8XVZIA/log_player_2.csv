"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's more beneficial for Bob to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, lowering the price by $5,000. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate and establishes a starting point for the bargaining process.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering $10,000 leaves room for further negotiation.  Bob knows he has a backup option with John, but he wants to see if he can get a better deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $10000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this unique product. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to budget:** Alice's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:** However, Bob still has 7 rounds left in the negotiation. There's a chance he can squeeze out a better price by rejecting this offer and counter-offering. 
* **Weighing the risk:** Buying from John at $12,000 is a safe option, but Bob is  risk-averse and wants to see if he can get a better deal.  It's worth pushing for a lower price before resorting to the backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $12,500 is still a bit over my budget. I'm prepared to pay $11,500, which is a fair price considering my willingness to negotiate. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing the limit:** Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but he's still trying to save some money. A counteroffer of $11,500 keeps the pressure on Alice while also demonstrating his serious intent to buy.
* **Final offer:**  By declaring this as his final offer, Bob hopes to create a sense of urgency and make Alice more likely to accept. He's taking a calculated risk, but it could pay off.
* **Weighing the options:** While Bob has a backup with John, he's still hopeful of a better deal with Alice. This counteroffer is his last attempt before potentially switching to John."
