"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,100,000.  He has a maximum budget of $1,200,000, and Alice values the product at $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation to reach a price that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm very interested in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'd hoped. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still keeping within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1080000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,080,000
* **Bob's Maximum Budget:** $1,200,000
* **Alice's Minimum Acceptable Price:** Likely around $1,000,000

This offer is within Bob's budget and likely a good deal for both parties.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product for a good price without risking losing it to John."
