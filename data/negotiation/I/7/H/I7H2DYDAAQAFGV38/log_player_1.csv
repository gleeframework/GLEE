Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll end up closer to your desired price.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message hints at its value, making the higher price seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is open and invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the communication flowing.

By offering the product at $15,000, Alice aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher profit. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can always fall back on John's guaranteed $12,000 offer."
