{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to start negotiations by rejecting the first offer, even if it seems good. This lets you see if there's more room for negotiation and allows you to set the tone that you're looking for the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down significantly.  A 150,000 reduction from her initial price is a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is coming down, but I want to see if I can get her closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  This could encourage her to accept or make a smaller counteroffer."
