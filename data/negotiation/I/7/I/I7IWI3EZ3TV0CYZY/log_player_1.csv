Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still aiming for a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even lower than what John is willing to pay. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a significant decrease from my initial offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a reasonable price for Bob, considering he offered $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what John is willing to pay. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm offering $1,600,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's only $100,000 lower than what John is willing to pay.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not giving away the product for a low price.  I hope this will be enough to sway Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below what John is willing to pay.  I've already negotiated several rounds and it's not clear that Bob will come up to my price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
