Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
