Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500.  It's a fantastic deal for something you're interested in."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $13,500 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly avoids the potential delay of going to John.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to convey the product's value without seeming too aggressive. 
 
This strategy balances risk and reward, giving Alice the best chance of maximizing her profit."
