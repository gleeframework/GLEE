"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $145 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $150.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $138. This is a great deal for a product you'll love, and it's closer to my minimum price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 138}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $138 is still a little more than I'm able to spend at the moment. I'm willing to pay $135. Let's see if we can strike a deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because while I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! How about $137? I'm really trying to work with you here, but I need to stay above my minimum price. This is a one-time offer, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 137}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a little over my budget at $137.  How about we meet in the middle at $136? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $136. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $136
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer for $136. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, I might lose the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a sale now than to risk getting nothing."
