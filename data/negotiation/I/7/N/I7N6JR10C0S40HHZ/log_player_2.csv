"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum price point of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, and I'm not in a rush. I want to try and get a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering my initial offer of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my maximum price point of $10,000. However, she's shown a willingness to negotiate. I'll counter with a lower offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'll meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,750. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, her offer is still above my maximum $10,000.  I've already had four rounds of negotiation and it seems like we might be locked in a stalemate.  Since I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000, it's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
