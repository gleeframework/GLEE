Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation and maximizes the potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000 provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can negotiate down or move on to John without losing out.
* **Psychology:**  A strong initial offer can sometimes anchor the negotiation in your favor, making Bob more receptive to a slightly lower (but still profitable) counter-offer."
