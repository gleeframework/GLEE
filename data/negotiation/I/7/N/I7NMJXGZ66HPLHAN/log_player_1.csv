{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. By saying ""I believe it's worth a lot to the right person,"" I subtly imply there might be a higher value for Bob, encouraging him to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be subjective, but based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum, it's still worth exploring if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not quite there yet.  While I understand your perspective, I believe the product's true value lies closer to my initial offer.  Let's compromise at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's unique benefits. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given your proposal some thought and I'm willing to meet somewhere in between our offers. How about $11000 for the product? I believe this price reflects its value while also being reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my initial price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
