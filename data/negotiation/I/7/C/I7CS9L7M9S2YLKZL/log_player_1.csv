Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200.  This gives me a decent margin while leaving room for negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, considering I value the product at $150.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own.  I'll also be mindful of John's offer of $150 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'd like to close the deal,  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is a significant step down from my initial offer but still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering Bob's low offer. I'm hopeful this will be acceptable to Bob and allow us to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price, but I don't see any further room for negotiation.  At this point, I'm content to sell the product to John for the same price.  It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm not interested in risking further rounds of negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
