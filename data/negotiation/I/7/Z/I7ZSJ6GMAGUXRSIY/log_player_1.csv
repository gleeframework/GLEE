Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value and potential."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value and my needs.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than $850,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal.   
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear we're unlikely to reach a price that satisfies my minimum ($1,000,000) and keeps Bob engaged. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical choice at this point."
