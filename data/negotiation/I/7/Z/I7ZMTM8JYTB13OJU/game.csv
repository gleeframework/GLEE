"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $150 for it, which is what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $165. It's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  Let's split the difference and settle on $160.  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go down to $160. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think $170 is the lowest I can go. It's still a good price considering the value it holds for you.",170.0,Alice,5,
