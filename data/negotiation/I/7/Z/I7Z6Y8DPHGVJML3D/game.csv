,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. That's a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's make this happen!",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250.  I'm willing to go up to $9,100, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this happen before we both miss out on a great deal.",9100.0,Bob,4,
