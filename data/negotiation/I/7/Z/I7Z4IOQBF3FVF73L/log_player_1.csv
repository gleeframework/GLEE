{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than your minimum, but not unreasonable. It allows for some negotiation and leaves room for a potential compromise.  I've also included a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, there's still some room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you considering its value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $12000. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, the chance of getting a higher price from Bob seems unlikely. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees my minimum and saves further negotiation time."
