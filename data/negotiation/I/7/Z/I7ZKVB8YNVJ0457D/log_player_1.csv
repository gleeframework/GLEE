"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This offer is a starting point, offering a good deal to Bob while still leaving room for potential negotiation. It's more than my minimum acceptable price but significantly less than Bob's perceived value."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm raising the price slightly from my previous offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering a price below my minimum acceptable price, but he's coming closer. I'll continue to negotiate and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are not improving.  While I'm not getting my desired price, I can't risk running out of rounds and being stuck with a low offer.  Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
