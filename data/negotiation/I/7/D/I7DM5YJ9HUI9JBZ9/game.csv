"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any flexibility on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll sell it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $9500. I can offer it to you for $10000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $9250. This is my last compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",9250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price. I can offer it to you for $9500, but I'm only doing this because I don't want to sell it to someone else. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",9500.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still not willing to pay $9500. I'm willing to meet you at $8000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to sell it to me for $8000, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $8000.",8000.0,Bob,10,
