"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to stay close to my initial target. I'm thinking of a price that's still a bit higher than your latest offer, but not too far off. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1650000. This is my final compromise, and I hope it's something you can work with.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and I'm not quite ready to give up on my target price yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1625000, but I'd like to propose a small premium for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1650000, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. If you're willing to meet me at $1625000, I'll include a special service package that will make the product even more valuable to you. What do you think?",1625000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the additional value you're providing, but I'm still hesitant about reaching the $1625000 mark. I'm willing to pay up to $1600000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,8,
