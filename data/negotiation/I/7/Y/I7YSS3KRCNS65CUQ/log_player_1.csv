Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob.  It's a price that is higher than my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe it's a reasonable starting point given that I don't know the value of the product to him.  

I'll be ready to counter if he rejects this offer.  However, if he becomes difficult or stalls the negotiation, I'll be happy to sell to John at $12,000 to guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $10,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. I'll counter his offer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if it drags on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm moving down to $13,000.  This is a compromise, but it still ensures I get a fair price for the product.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good middle ground and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since John is willing to pay $12,000. I'll counter Bob's offer one more time.  If he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a good price for me and still allows for a profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be happy to sell to John for $12,000 to guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum price, but he's still not willing to budge.  Since John is also offering $12,000,  I'm going to take the guaranteed sale with John to avoid further negotiation with Bob."
