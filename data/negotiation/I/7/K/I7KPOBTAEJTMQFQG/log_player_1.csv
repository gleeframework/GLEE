I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $90.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price in the remaining rounds. I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing the deal completely."
