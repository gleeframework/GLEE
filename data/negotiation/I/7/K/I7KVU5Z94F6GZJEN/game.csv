"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $700,000 for the product. I believe it's a bit steep at $900,000, and I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $850,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product and is still a great deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
