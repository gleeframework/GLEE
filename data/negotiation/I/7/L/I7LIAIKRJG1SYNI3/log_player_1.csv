"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to come down to a price closer to my desired range.  I'm also acknowledging the potential value to his business to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1000000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can come to an agreement.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the unique value and potential of this product for your business.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit high at $900000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and represents a good compromise.  It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
