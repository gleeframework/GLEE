Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $15000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product to me. However, $12000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10500 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own budget constraints. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a compromise that takes into account the value of the product to you and my own minimum price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
