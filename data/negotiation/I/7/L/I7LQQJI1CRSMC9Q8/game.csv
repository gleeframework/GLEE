"Hello Bob, I'm excited to start our negotiation. I think my product is a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,800,000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in your product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, as I believe it aligns with its true market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is your budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,600,000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair value for the product. I believe this is a good compromise and hope we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
