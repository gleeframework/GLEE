"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain. Let's make a deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go to $1,060,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close the deal.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,060,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,065,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and is fair to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1065000.0,Alice,5,
