"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $825,000.  This is very close to my budget, and I believe it reflects the value I see in your product.  What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
