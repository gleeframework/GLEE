Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Offering it for the full $15,000 might make Bob balk. This offer balances the risk of losing him with the reward of a higher profit margin.
* **Alternative Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, ensuring you don't lose out entirely."
