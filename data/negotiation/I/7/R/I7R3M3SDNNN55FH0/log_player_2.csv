"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* Accepting her offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John. 

While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'd go lower. Accepting this offer secures the product within your budget."
