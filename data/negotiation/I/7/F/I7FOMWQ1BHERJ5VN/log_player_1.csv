"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $95 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about $90? That's still a good value for you, and it gives us both a bit of room to work with. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $87 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $90.  There are still a few rounds left, so I'm going to try to close the deal for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate that. Let's split the difference. How about $88? This would be a fair price for both of us and ensure a smooth deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 88}
