You can likely get a better price from Alice than $140.  It's worth negotiating further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice has come down to $135, which is a better price than John's $150, and only $15 more than your initial counteroffer.  It's a good deal."
