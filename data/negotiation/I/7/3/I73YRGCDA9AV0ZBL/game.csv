"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $600,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid $400,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $550,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $550,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about $450,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $500,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm proposing a price of $500,000, which is a 10% discount from my original offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your budget.",500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $500,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $475,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",475000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $500,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm proposing a price of $490,000, which is a 2% discount from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your budget.",490000.0,Alice,7,
