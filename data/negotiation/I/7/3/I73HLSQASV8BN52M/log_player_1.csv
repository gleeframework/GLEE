"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly values the product at $120, so there's potential to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $105 is just a bit too low for me. How about $110? That's a fair price considering what this product can do for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $107.5 is just slightly below my minimum desired price of $100.  I'm close to my target and risking further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price or a deal falling apart.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's getting riskier to continue negotiating. 
* **Potential for Better Deals:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will accept, and I could end up selling to John for less.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
