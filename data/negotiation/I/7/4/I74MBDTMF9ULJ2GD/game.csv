"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a profit. Can we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a good compromise and allows us both to make a profitable deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be more aggressive. Can we discuss $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $950,000. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it allows us to move forward with the transaction. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a significant compromise and reflects the value of this product. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let's make this deal happen.",940000.0,Alice,7,
