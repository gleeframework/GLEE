Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in continuing the negotiation if you're open to a figure closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,300,000 represents a fair assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to facilitate a deal. This offer reflects my strong desire to see this product in your capable hands."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still considerably outside my budget.  To be realistic, I can't go any higher than $700,000.  If that's not workable, I might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is too far from my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely we'll reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a significant amount and ensures I don't lose out by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
