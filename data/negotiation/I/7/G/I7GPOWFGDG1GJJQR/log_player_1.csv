Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your opening offer. That price is a bit high for me, how about we start the negotiations at a lower figure?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet somewhere in the middle, how about $1,500,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider coming down a little further to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're still not in a good spot. While getting closer, Bob's offer is still significantly below both our minimum and his stated value of the product. We need to push him further towards a more reasonable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me to consider. This product is worth a significant investment, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we settle on $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is getting close, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference and say $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push for a bit more, accepting $1,150,000 is a good outcome. It surpasses our minimum by $150,000 and shows Bob we're willing to negotiate fairly. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale by pushing too hard."
