Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $150, starting with $125 aims for a higher profit margin.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $125 price point allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message frames the price as a ""special deal,"" potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. If you had more information, you could potentially push for a higher price."
