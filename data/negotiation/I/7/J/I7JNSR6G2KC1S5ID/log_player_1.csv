"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer close to my desired price point. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** Emphasizing the fairness of the offer helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm not being overly aggressive, allowing for negotiation without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my desired price point. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my goal.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  While $900,000 is more than John's offer, it's still a substantial loss on the value I know the product holds for Bob. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can strategically counteroffer and explore if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value you've placed on the product, and it allows me to move forward with this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm not going too low.  This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Reinforce Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the significant value the product holds for him.  This subtly pressures him to consider a higher offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as beneficial for both of us.  This creates a sense of fairness and encourages a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950000. This is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, there's still a significant gap between his offer and my desired price point.
* **Value to Bob:**  I believe the product holds a significant value for Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect that. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I can potentially push for a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 

I'm not ready to accept $950,000 yet. There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This shows a significant compromise on my part and would still allow you to get a fantastic deal on a product you value highly."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm showing a slight willingness to compromise by coming down from my previous offer, but I'm still keeping the price closer to my target.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him and highlighting the fact that $975,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is intended to be a final push before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but there's still a significant gap between his offer and what I'm looking for.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, I believe there's still a good chance I can negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I can potentially push for a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round. 

I'm willing to take a risk and continue negotiating with Bob. I'm confident that I can secure a better price than John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal considering the value you've placed on the product. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear this is my final offer to Bob. 
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise, but still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the significant value he sees in the product.
* **Pressuring for Acceptance:**  By making this my final offer, I'm hoping to pressure Bob into accepting to avoid losing out on the deal.

This is a tough decision, but I'm confident this counteroffer provides the best chance to get a price closer to my target without risking losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go above $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still significantly lower than what I would like to receive. There's very little room for further negotiation.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much, and there's a real risk that he'll walk away if I reject his offer.
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $800,000, which is more than Bob's current offer and closer to my minimum.

At this point, I'm willing to take the guaranteed profit from John's offer. The risk of continuing negotiations is too high, and I don't want to end up with a much lower price or no deal at all."
