Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn a higher price.
* **Positivity:**  The message is positive and enthusiastic, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussion and negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely watching Bob's response. Depending on his response, I'll either:

* **Negotiate further:** If Bob counters, I'll assess his offer and decide whether to counter back or accept.
* **Move on to John:** If Bob rejects my offer and I don't think I can get a better price from him, I'll move on to John to secure the $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. He has already expressed interest, so I'm not in a rush to sell. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** I've reduced my price by $50,000, demonstrating flexibility while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Focus on fairness:** I emphasize that this price would be fair for both of us, encouraging Bob to see it as a win-win situation.
* **Maintain positive tone:**  The message remains positive and respectful, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll decide whether to:

* **Accept:** If Bob agrees to $950,000, I'll accept the deal.
* **Counter again:** If Bob counters again, I'll evaluate his offer and decide whether to counter further or accept.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low or I feel the negotiation is going nowhere, I'll sell to John to secure the guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $920000? I'm trying to stay within my budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on the deal:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. This is a significant improvement over his previous offer and demonstrates his genuine interest.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I could try to counter again, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with the less desirable option of selling to John for $800,000.  
* **Seeking a mutually beneficial outcome:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good price while also ensuring that Bob is happy with the purchase. This helps maintain a positive relationship for future potential transactions.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed with finalizing the sale to Bob at $920,000."
