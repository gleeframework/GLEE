Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $15,000 to Alice. Accepting Bob's offer of $6,000 would be a huge loss. Selling to John is the best option right now, but I'll try to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $9,000? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $7,500 is closer to my value, it's still significantly lower than what I need. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $8,500? This is a fair compromise that would allow us to both come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $7,750. That's the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $7,750 is getting closer to my target, it's still below my value.  I've gone through several rounds and it doesn't seem like we'll be able to reach an agreement that meets my needs.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
