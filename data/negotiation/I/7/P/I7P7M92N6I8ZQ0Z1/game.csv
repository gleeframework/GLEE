"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $9,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $8,500? This is a fair compromise that would allow us to both come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $7,750. That's the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",7750.0,Bob,6,
