Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but also allows me to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,325,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but also allows me to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested.  We're aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000 and have time to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle this right now at $1,300,000?  This seems like a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're close, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from my target. How about we meet at $1,275,000? This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make it work at this point. Would you be willing to accept this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has countered at $1,275,000 twice now.  This indicates it's likely his ceiling, and pushing further risks him walking away. Accepting ensures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
