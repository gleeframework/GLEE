"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll experience.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but also allows me to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the budget. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This reflects the true value while still providing you a significant return on your investment.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,325,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but also allows me to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle this right now at $1,300,000?  This seems like a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're close, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from my target. How about we meet at $1,275,000? This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make it work at this point. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
