Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 benefits both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  A price too close to $1,200,000 might make Bob hesitate, while a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and highlights the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000  splits the ZOPA roughly in half, giving both parties a substantial gain.
* **Open for Discussion:** The tone invites Bob's input, allowing for potential negotiation while keeping your position strong. 

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Remember, you don't know Bob's negotiation style. Be prepared to potentially adjust your approach if he counters.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While you have John, having multiple potential buyers can strengthen your position in future negotiations."
