"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and functionality of your business. Given its immense worth to you, I propose a transaction price of $950,000. This offer represents an exceptional opportunity to secure a valuable asset at a price that is both competitive and fair. I look forward to discussing this further and potentially bringing this product to your esteemed organization. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $950,000 is better than John's offer of $1,000,000, it's still not the best deal for Bob. 

Bob can reject Alice's offer and still buy the product from John.  This strategy allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller who might be willing to sell for closer to his desired price point."
