"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be interested if you were willing to go down to $80.  It's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $160 for the product. Would you be willing to consider $145?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $145 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $155 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50?",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $132.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal and avoid wasting any more time.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final compromise.",125.0,Alice,7,
