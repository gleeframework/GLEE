"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth $800,000 to you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It also explicitly states the value to Bob, making it clear that this is a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can get a better price.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can both come away satisfied with this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting it ensures I get a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for the same amount."
