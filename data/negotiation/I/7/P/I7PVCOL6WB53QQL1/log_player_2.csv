"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth $800,000 to you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiations and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, I can continue negotiating and try to get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can both come away satisfied with this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
