"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
