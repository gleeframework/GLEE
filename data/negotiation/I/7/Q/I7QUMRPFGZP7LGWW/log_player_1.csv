"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations slightly above your desired price point. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and Alice values it at a minimum of $1,200,000. An initial offer of $1,150,000 aims to find a middle ground that could be mutually beneficial. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,150,000, Alice leaves room to potentially lower the price during subsequent rounds of negotiation while still remaining above her minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree that the product has potential, but the price point is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this would result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is low, it's still early in the negotiation. Alice should counter with a price closer to her desired range, aiming to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome. 
* **John as Backup:** Alice always has the option to sell to John for her minimum acceptable price, ensuring she won't be forced into a deal below her valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to move this negotiation forward. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Alice acknowledges Bob's counteroffer but holds firm on her stance that $900,000 is too low. By reducing her price to $1,100,000, she's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price close to her target.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price point. 
* **Limited Concessions:** Alice is making smaller concessions now to signal that she's reaching the limit of what she's willing to accept. This encourages Bob to take her offers more seriously as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 matches his valuation but is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting would mean a $200,000 loss compared to selling to John.
* **Leverage Time:** There are still six rounds remaining. While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, Alice has time to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal.
* **John as Safety Net:**  The guaranteed offer from John gives Alice a strong negotiating position.  She can afford to be patient and continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price.  To be transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,200,000 from another buyer.  However, I value our discussions and believe you would benefit greatly from this product. To close this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1150,000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is her final offer, Alice is creating a sense of urgency and signaling the end of concessions.
* **Transparency and Justification:** Revealing the standing offer adds credibility to her position and justifies the price point without seeming arbitrary.
* **Firm but Fair:** Alice is standing firm at a price above her minimum while still offering a potential discount compared to the other buyer. This encourages Bob to make a final decision. 
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:** Alice is prepared to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't accept, knowing she has a secure alternative. This puts her in a strong negotiating position."
