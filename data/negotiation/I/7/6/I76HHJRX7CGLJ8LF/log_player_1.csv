I'm still trying to get a higher price from Bob.  He's already shown he's willing to pay close to my asking price, so I'm not going to settle for $11,000 just yet. I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach a compromise."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm running out of time. I've already made several counteroffers, and it's clear we're not going to agree on a price.  Rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's still a better deal than selling it to Bob for $10,800."
