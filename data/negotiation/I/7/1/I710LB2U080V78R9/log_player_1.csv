Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum price of $80, but still potentially attractive to Bob.  We can adjust the price based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$70 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still above my minimum price of $80 and hopefully high enough to entice Bob but not so high that he'll immediately reject it.  We'll see what his response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer. However, I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob, and John is offering me a guaranteed $80. I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John."
