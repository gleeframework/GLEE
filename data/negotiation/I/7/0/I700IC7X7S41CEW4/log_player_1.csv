Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal and worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum desired price of $150 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm offering a good deal to Bob, which might make him more likely to accept. If he rejects, I can use the information from his counteroffer to make a more strategic decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $150, and significantly lower than my initial offer of $130.  I'm not comfortable accepting his offer at this time.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $110 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. Let's meet halfway!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum desired price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I don't want to risk going lower and potentially losing out on a better deal.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum desired price and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
