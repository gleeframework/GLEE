Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible, while ensuring she gets more than John's offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. Alice can then potentially drop the price slightly while still remaining above her minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and avoids appearing desperate, which can give Bob more confidence in the offer."
