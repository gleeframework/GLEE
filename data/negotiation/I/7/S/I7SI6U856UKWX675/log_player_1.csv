Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to explore the possibility of buying the product, but I'd need to see a lower price. I'm willing to pay $700,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
