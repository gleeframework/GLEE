"Alice, while I acknowledge the product's potential, $1,500,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, a price that reflects its value to me.  I believe this is a fair offer, given the product's worth to both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is below my threshold.  This product has significant value beyond what you're currently seeing.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,250,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This offer reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
