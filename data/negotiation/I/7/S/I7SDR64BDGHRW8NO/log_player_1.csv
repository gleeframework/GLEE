{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I think it will be a valuable asset to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $15,000 before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. I'm confident it will be worth it for you in the long run. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll get a good deal for your product. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob, but I'm also not willing to settle for less than $14,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more and see if I can bridge the gap."
