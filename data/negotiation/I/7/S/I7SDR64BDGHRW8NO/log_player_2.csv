"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I think it will be a valuable asset to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and her offer is $17,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. I'm confident it will be worth it for you in the long run. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is closer to your limit, it's still more than you're willing to pay. Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so it's worth trying another counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll get a good deal for your product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than you're willing to pay. Even though she's come down from her initial price, it's still above your limit.  It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John for $10,000. You've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely Alice will drop her price any further."
