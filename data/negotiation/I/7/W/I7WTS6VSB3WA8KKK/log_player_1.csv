"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is a good middle ground between your minimum and Bob's perceived value.  It also opens the conversation with a friendly tone, making Bob feel more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think $85 would be a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can push closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I think $87.5 would be a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're able to meet that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is only $2.50 away from my minimum price.  While I'd love to get closer to $100, there's a risk that he will continue to lower his offer, or I'll have to sell to John for less. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
