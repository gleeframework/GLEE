{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  I'll be prepared to counter if he rejects the offer, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, but it's closer than his initial offer.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I'll keep in mind that John is willing to pay $15,000, which gives me a good benchmark for negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,500.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's price, but I'm still holding out for a profit. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, but it also demonstrates my willingness to compromise.  I'm ready to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and agree on $11,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is just above my minimum price of $10,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price of $15,000,  I'm running the risk of losing Bob and having to sell to John.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
