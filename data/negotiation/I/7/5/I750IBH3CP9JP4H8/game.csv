"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $760,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $760,000. I'm willing to make another concession and meet you at $810,000. This is the closest I can get to your offer without compromising my minimum price. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am motivated to buy.  Could you do $780,000?  I think that's a price we both can agree on.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $820,000. This is as low as I can go without compromising my minimum price. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm ready to close this deal today but  $820,000 is still just a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? That's a fair offer, and I think it's a win-win for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,8,
