Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""great deal for the value,""  I'm subtly implying the product is worth more than the asking price, potentially swaying Bob.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I know John will buy the product for $120, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to be firm with Bob if needed. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject a higher offer outright. However, this strategy maximizes potential profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium or negotiate."
