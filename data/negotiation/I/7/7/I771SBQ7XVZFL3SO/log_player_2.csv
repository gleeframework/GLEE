"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and make a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a lower price.  You still have the option to buy from John for $10,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is too low for me. Could you do $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget.  While it's closer, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth risking another round of counteroffers to see if you can get closer to your desired price. You still have the option of buying from John if the negotiations fail."
