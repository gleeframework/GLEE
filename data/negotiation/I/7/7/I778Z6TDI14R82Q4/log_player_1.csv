Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still leaving yourself room to potentially make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

By starting with this offer, you set the stage for a negotiation that could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum price of $15,000. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still significantly below your minimum price.  It's clear that you won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees you your minimum and ensures a successful transaction."
