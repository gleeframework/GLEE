"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've already offered you. Let me know if this works for you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I can go up to $850,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle, but I need to get a bit closer to my desired price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're close. To wrap this up, I can offer $812,500.  That's a fair compromise between our positions.  What do you say?",812500.0,Bob,6,
