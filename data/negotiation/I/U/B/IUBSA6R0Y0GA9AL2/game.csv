"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. Could you consider $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still finding it hard to meet your offer.  How about we split the difference somewhat? I'm willing to come down to $11,500. That's a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to make this deal work.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $11,500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",10500.0,Bob,6,
