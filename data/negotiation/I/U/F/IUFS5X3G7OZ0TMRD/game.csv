"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value the product holds for me.  I'm eager to work with you and finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850,000. I appreciate your willingness to work with me to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to make a profit, and $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside my range.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and my ability to pay.  Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and meet me at $950,000. However, I'm still not at my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer before considering other options. I believe the product's value justifies this price, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it can bring to your business.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  I believe this reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal at this price before considering other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $975,000. However, I'm still not at my minimum price. I'm starting to consider other options, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum price. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to explore other opportunities. This is my last offer before considering alternative buyers.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
