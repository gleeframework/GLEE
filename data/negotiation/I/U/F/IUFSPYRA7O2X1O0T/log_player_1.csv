{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefit it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential value"" to entice Bob. 
* **Backup Option:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, providing a safety net if Bob rejects the offer.

By offering the product at $1,400,000, Alice strikes a balance between maximizing her potential earnings and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
