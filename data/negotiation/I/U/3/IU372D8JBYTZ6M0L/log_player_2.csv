"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, you want to save as much as possible. Since you're willing to pay up to $150, you have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $115, which is within my acceptable range of $150.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject my counteroffer and the price could go up again.  Accepting her offer ensures I get the product for a price I'm comfortable with and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
