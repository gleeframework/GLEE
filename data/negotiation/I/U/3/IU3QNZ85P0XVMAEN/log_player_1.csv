"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering your lower valuation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget.  Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $910,000. This price reflects the value of the product and my budget. It's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although we are getting closer, $910,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can push for a higher price, and I have more rounds to negotiate."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $915,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $905,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product and our respective positions. It's time to reach a compromise and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $905,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $905,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. We're running out of rounds, and Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum value.  While $905,000 is a decent offer, John's $1,200,000 is a much better deal for me.  It's time to secure the best possible outcome."
