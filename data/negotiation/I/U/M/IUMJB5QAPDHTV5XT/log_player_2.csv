Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,500, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,000. Accepting this offer saves me $4,000 compared to John's price, which is a significant saving."
