Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I'm thinking of starting at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.
