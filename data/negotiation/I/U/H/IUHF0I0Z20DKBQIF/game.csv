,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply not feasible for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's still a great price for you, considering the value you place on the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from $15,000. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we settle on $14,000? This price allows me to cover my costs and gives you a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,750. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",13750.0,Bob,6,
