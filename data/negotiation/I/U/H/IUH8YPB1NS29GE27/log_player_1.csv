{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the potential for a good deal. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Don't start too low:**  Starting too low risks leaving money on the table. 
* **Don't start too high:** Starting too high risks alienating Bob and making him less likely to negotiate.
* **Create a win-win:**  This price gives Bob a potential $200,000 in savings while still allowing you to earn a significant amount above John's offer. 
* **Be prepared to negotiate:**  It's unlikely Bob will accept the first offer, so be ready to counter-offer and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a better price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation.  Bob clearly wants the product and is willing to pay closer to my value.
* **No urgency to sell to John:** I have a backup offer from John, but I'm not under immediate pressure to accept it.

**Next Steps:**  I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired value."
