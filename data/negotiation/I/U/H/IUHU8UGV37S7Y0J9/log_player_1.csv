"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects the offer. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $80 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $80. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm countering with $85. This is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'm still above my minimum, and I hope this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's only $2 above my minimum, it's a better deal than selling to John for $80. I'm also concerned that continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a lower price or a drawn-out process that could lead to a rejection and a sale to John at the minimum."
