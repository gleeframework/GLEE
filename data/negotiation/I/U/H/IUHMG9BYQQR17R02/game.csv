"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it. I am interested in purchasing it, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that.  However, $925,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to drop my price to $940,000, which reflects a significant concession on my part.  Let's work towards a final agreement. ",940000.0,Alice,5,
