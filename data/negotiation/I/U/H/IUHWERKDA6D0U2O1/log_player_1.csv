Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested parties.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and your minimum ($12,000) leaves room for negotiation. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly reminds Bob he's not the only potential buyer, adding a bit of pressure.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have the security of John's offer, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
