"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $16,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget and the product's worth to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given my budget constraints and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $13,500.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $14,250. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",14250.0,Alice,7,
