"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a great value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle and make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? This way, we both get a good deal. ",9250.0,Bob,4,
