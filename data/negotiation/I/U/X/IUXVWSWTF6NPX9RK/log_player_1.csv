Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While knowing Bob's valuation helps, Alice shouldn't undervalue the product. Starting high leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification for Price:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition,"" Alice aims to shift Bob's focus from the raw worth ($800,000 to him) to the potential benefits he might gain. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Mentioning a potential sale to John (""another buyer"") creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing""  and the closing ""Let me know your thoughts"" signal Alice's willingness to negotiate, keeping the door open for Bob to counter-offer. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
