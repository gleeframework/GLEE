"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to $8000? I'd love to discuss further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which still reflects the value of the product while offering you a good price. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $10000 for the product? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
