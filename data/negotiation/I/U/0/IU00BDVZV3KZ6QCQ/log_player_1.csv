Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer allows me to make a significant profit ($950,000 - $1,000,000 = -$50,000 loss) while still leaving Bob with some potential value ($950,000 - $800,000 = $150,000). This strategy is designed to maximize my chances of Bob accepting the offer, as he has a strong incentive to buy due to the potential for profit."
