"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $875,000 is still a little steeper than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $830,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise to bridge the gap.",830000.0,Alice,5,
