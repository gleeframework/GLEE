"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-value item at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than the product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and the guaranteed price from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and save $200,000."
