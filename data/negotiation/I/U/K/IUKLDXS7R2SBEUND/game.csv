"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my current financial constraints, I am unable to meet at $1,500,000. Would it be possible to consider $1,450,000 as a compromise?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
