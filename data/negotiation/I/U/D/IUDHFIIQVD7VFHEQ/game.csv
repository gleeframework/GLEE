"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, but I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. It's a fair price considering the value we both place on this product. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $925,000. It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from here.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  While $925,000 is getting closer, I'm still only able to offer $875,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can finalize this deal with a small final adjustment.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to end the negotiation here if you're comfortable with it.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product, and it's a price I can comfortably manage.  I hope we can close this deal now.",875000.0,Bob,8,
