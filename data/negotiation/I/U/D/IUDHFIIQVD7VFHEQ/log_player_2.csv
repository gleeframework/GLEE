# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,000,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Justifying the price:**  The message provides a reason for the lower price, highlighting the value you place on the product compared to Alice's own valuation.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, but I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is getting closer to your desired price point. However, $900,000 is still above your maximum budget.  You have a few more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price.
