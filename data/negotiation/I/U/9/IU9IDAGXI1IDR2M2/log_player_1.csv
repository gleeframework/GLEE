Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower than the midpoint between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and your minimum ($1,200,000) allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer."
