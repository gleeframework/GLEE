"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll see it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's crucial to start negotiating and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend. I'm genuinely interested in this product but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  This is my top price,  let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Clear:**  The message states Bob's interest but clearly outlines his financial constraints.
* **Top Price:** Stating it's his ""top price"" indicates a non-negotiable point, putting pressure on Alice.
* **Open to Agreement:** The message ends with a positive note, emphasizing a desire to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $17,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice closer to his desired price point.  Buying from John for $10,000 is always an option, but there's still room to potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being more flexible, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $12,000.  This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price reflecting the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob is showing he's willing to negotiate but not by a large margin, emphasizing his budget constraints.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Bob focuses on the value he sees, reinforcing his genuine interest.
* **Fair Price:** The counteroffer is framed as a ""fair price"" to make it more palatable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to where we need to be, there's still a gap.  I'm willing to accept $15,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's ""final offer"" is $15,000, which is still outside of Bob's budget of $10,000.** 
* **Bob has already negotiated down from $20,000 to $15,000 and there is limited room for further concessions.**
* **While there are more rounds, the risk of Alice staying firm and Bob losing the opportunity to buy from John is high.**

At this point, the best decision for Bob is to secure the product from John for $10,000.  Even though it's not his ideal price, it's within his budget and ensures he gets the product."
