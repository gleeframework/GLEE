Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your compromise is appreciated.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000.  This is a fair offer reflecting the value and our negotiations.

``` 

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is a solid deal.  While holding out for more is tempting, we are already well above our minimum and close to Bob's perceived value. Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of the deal falling through in later rounds."
