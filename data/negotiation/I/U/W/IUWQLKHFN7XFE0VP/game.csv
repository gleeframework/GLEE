"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9500. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $10800. This is a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",9800.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $9500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. If not, I'm considering buying from another seller who is willing to sell it to me for $10000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",9500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're considering other options, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $10200.

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $9200. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000. I'm willing to walk away from this deal if it's not a mutually beneficial one.",9200.0,Bob,10,
