"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $10000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway between $15000 and $10000, which would be $12500. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. Would you be interested in considering this counteroffer?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than your latest offer. I can offer the product to you for $11000. This is still a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle on this. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $9500. This is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept this offer?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me at $9500, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer that's slightly higher than your latest offer. I can offer the product to you for $11200. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,7,
