"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that the product holds value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,250 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
