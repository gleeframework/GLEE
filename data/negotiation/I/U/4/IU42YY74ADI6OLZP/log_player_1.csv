Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still push for a higher price. The product is worth more to Bob than he's offering, and there are still rounds left to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not convinced it's a fair deal considering the value the product holds for him.  I have enough rounds left to continue negotiating and see if I can secure a price closer to $900,000."
