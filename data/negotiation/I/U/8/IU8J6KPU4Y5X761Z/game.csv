"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. This product looks promising, but  $750,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While this product is certainly attractive, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $680,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",680000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $680,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
