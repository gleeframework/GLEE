Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your discerning taste. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification for Price:**  The message subtly implies the product's value and exclusivity,  justifying the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for you. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could choose to open with a lower offer, especially if you want to close the deal quickly."
