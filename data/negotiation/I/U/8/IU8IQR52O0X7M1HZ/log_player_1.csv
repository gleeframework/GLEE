Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

Since I value the product at $1,200,000, I will offer it to Bob for that price. This gives him an opportunity to purchase the product at a price that's significantly lower than my valuation. However, this is also the price that John is willing to pay, so I'm not losing out on any potential profit by offering this price to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum valuation of $1,200,000.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to accept such a large discount. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $1,100,000. This is still significantly lower than my valuation, but it's a compromise that might be acceptable to Bob, especially since he's already rejected my initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum valuation, it's still not enough for me to accept. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,150,000.  This is a further compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a significant profit margin for me.  I'm hopeful that this offer will be acceptable to Bob, as it's only $50,000 away from his latest offer."
