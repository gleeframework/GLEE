"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal is to save money.**  $95 is still above your maximum value of $100. 
* **You have time.**  There are 10 rounds, so you can try to negotiate a better price.
* **John is an option.**  Knowing you have John as an alternative gives you negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to buy the product for $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  Starting with a lower offer than Alice's shows you're serious about saving money, but $85 is still above Alice's value, making the offer potentially appealing.
* **Room for negotiation:**  You still have 9 rounds left, so there's room to adjust the price if needed.
* **Focusing on value:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth to Alice, framing the offer as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your limit:** $90 is still more than your maximum value of $100.
* **More room to negotiate:** You have 7 rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **John is a safety net:** You can always buy from John for $100, so you're not under pressure to accept a deal right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $90.  How about we settle at $87.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  A small increase from your previous offer shows you're serious about negotiating, but not being unreasonable.
* **Compromise language:**  The message frames the offer as a fair middle ground, appealing to Alice's desire for a resolution.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in a deal helps create a sense of urgency for Alice."
