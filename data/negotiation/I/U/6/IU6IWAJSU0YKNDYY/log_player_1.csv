{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This price is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. It leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a healthy profit margin. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message brief and positive, highlighting the potential value to Bob without revealing too much information about the product's worth to me. This helps me avoid anchoring the negotiation too early.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've successfully sold the product.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer. 
* **If the negotiation with Bob drags on:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't get stuck in a negotiation that's not yielding a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Reasoning:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested, and by rejecting his offer, I can  signal that I'm not desperate to sell at that price.
* **Next Steps:**  I will counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $11,500, which is halfway between my previous offer ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($8,000). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm focusing on the mutual benefit of reaching a fair price. I'm also using positive language to maintain a friendly tone and encourage further negotiation.
* **Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept my counteroffer. If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating until we find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9000. Would you be willing to consider $9200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum price of $10,000, it's still not enough to make the sale worthwhile.
* **Reasoning:** I'm feeling confident that I can get a better price from Bob or John.  
* **Next Steps:**  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range again, potentially a little lower than my previous offer to show I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'll continue to assess John's offer of $10,000 as a backup plan if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I think it would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $9,800, which is halfway between my previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($9,200). This shows I'm willing to negotiate further and find a compromise.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the potential for mutual benefit. I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John. While $9,800 is not ideal, it's closer to my minimum price than John's offer. However, I'll keep trying to negotiate with Bob if there's a chance of getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9500. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:**  Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm hesitant to continue negotiating. It's becoming clear that Bob might not be willing to meet my minimum price of $10,000.  
* **Reasoning:** John's offer of $10,000 guarantees me a sale that meets my minimum requirements. It's a safe and reliable option, and I don't want to risk losing out on this deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Moving On:**  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my original goal, I'm choosing to secure the sale with John to avoid potentially wasting more time and effort in negotiation."
