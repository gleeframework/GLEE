"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He's looking to pay no more than $12,000, and Alice's offer is above that. It's worth seeing if he can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still get a good value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, he's still willing to pay less than $12,000, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal, or opt to buy from John if the next few rounds don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer.  While $13,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $13,250.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If this offer isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to other opportunities.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer is still above his target price of $12,000, and even though it's a significant concession, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, which is the best option for Bob to achieve his goal of saving as much money as possible."
