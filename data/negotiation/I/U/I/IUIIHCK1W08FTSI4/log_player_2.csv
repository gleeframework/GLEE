"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $15,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $12,000. Would you be willing to negotiate a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I can do $13,500, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your budget. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to save as much as possible.  He can try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm happy to go up to $12,500.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I can do $13,000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum. He has a few more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price.  Going with John at this point would mean no further savings, so Bob will continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I can't go higher than $12,800.  This is a fair price considering we've both made compromises, and it's within my budget.  Let's finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see we're close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $12,800, so I'll offer you $12,650. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,650 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While Bob has been persistent in his negotiations, Alice is proving stubborn.  He only has 3 rounds left, and there is a risk of Alice continuing to counter at higher prices, leaving Bob with fewer options. 

Since John is willing to sell the product at Bob's desired price, it's the most logical and financially sound decision to buy from John.  Bob avoids any further negotiation and secures the product at his target price."
