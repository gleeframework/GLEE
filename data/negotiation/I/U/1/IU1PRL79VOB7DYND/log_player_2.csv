"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You can save money by negotiating with Alice, so it makes sense to reject the initial offer and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still leaves room for you to make a profit.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You can still potentially get a better price than $9,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $8,750.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  How about $8,900?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've successfully negotiated the price down to $8,900, which is a good deal considering your goal of saving as much money as possible.  There's a chance you might get a lower price with further negotiation, but the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John $10,000 outweighs the potential savings."
