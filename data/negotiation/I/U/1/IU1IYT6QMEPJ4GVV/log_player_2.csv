"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $11,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum price, but there's still room for negotiation. You should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to lower the price significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting you closer to the middle ground now. While you could try to negotiate further, the difference is getting smaller and you risk Alice becoming less willing to negotiate. Accepting $11,000 saves you $1,000 compared to John's offer."
