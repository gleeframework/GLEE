Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $10,000.  Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $13,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $11,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $12,500.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. If we don't agree on this price, I might have to reconsider selling to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I understand this is your bottom line, but I can't quite reach $12,500.  My absolute maximum is $11,500. If you can do that, we have a deal.  If not, I appreciate your time, and I'll need to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,500 simply isn't enough for me. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer willing to pay $12,000, so I'm only a small amount away from walking away.  To make this happen, I'm willing to accept $12,000 as a final offer. If you're willing to go that high, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made it clear that $12,000 is her absolute bottom line.  Since you have the option to buy from John at that price anyway, there's no point in continuing the negotiation. You won't be able to get a better price from Alice."
