"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not sure if I'm ready to commit to $10800. I'd like to propose a price of $10000. I'm getting close to my limit, but I need to be careful with my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
