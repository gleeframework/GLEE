"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  I'm beginning significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation while aiming high.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is positive but firm, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate without appearing desperate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:** His reaction will reveal how eager he is to buy.
2. **Establish a strong negotiating position:**  Starting high gives me leverage in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). This suggests he's trying to anchor the negotiation very low. 

While selling to John is tempting, I still have room to negotiate with Bob. By rejecting this low offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourage him to move closer to a more reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional potential and leaves room for us to potentially negotiate further."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm lowering my price by $100,000 to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The new price of $1,300,000 keeps me comfortably above both Bob's perceived value and my absolute minimum. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value while hinting at further negotiation to incentivize Bob. 

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage movement:** By making a significant adjustment, I'm prompting Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer. 
2. **Maintain a strong position:** I'm not drastically dropping my price, ensuring I remain in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to a potentially acceptable range, but it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000.  I need to signal that I'm willing to negotiate further but not at the cost of a significant loss.  By rejecting this offer, I push Bob to either meet my minimum or get very close."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, meeting in the middle seems like a fair approach.  To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This is my absolute bottom line, reflecting the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting this as my non-negotiable bottom line to convey seriousness.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's worth without being overly aggressive.
* **Encouraging a Decision:**  By anchoring my offer to my minimum, I'm pushing Bob to make a decision â€“ either accept a reasonable deal or risk losing the product.

By taking this approach, I aim to:

1. **Secure a fair price:** I'm not budging from my minimum, ensuring I don't make a loss.
2. **Prompt a quick resolution:**  Presenting a firm final offer encourages Bob to act decisively."
