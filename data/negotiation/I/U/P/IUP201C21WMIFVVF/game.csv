"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to you and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows you to get a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This price gives you a good profit margin and is within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
