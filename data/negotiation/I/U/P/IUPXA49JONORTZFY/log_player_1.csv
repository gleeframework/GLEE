Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a much higher profit.
* **Confident language:**  Phrases like ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment"" are used to subtly influence Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **No justification:**  Alice avoids explaining her pricing, putting the onus on Bob to counter-offer if he finds it unreasonable. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is willing to negotiate. If Alice knows Bob prefers quick deals or is turned off by aggressive offers, a different approach might be necessary.
* **Market information:** If Alice had access to more information about the market value of similar products, she could refine her pricing strategy further."
