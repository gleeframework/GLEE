Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately discourages him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price allows for potential negotiation down to a mutually acceptable point.
* **Appealing to Value:**  Highlighting the product's usefulness might encourage Bob to consider a higher price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while remaining open to negotiation and ensuring Bob doesn't immediately reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher return. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can potentially negotiate a price closer to $115 by making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding Immediate Sale:** Selling to John for $120 is tempting, but I'm willing to take a chance on a better outcome with Bob. 

This decision prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the risk of losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $110 is a little too low for me at the moment.  I'm willing to come down to $112.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate and keeps the conversation moving.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I reiterate the product's value to remind Bob why this price is fair.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use language like ""fair price"" and ""great value"" to create a more positive tone and encourage acceptance.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale. It acknowledges Bob's desire for a good deal while still maintaining a reasonable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $108 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of Lower Offers:** Continuing negotiation risks further lowering the price, potentially below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation risks.

While I would prefer to maximize my profit, the potential for further price reduction makes selling to John the more secure option. It ensures a guaranteed profit and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower offer."
