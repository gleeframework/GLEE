Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}

Round 4

Bob is sticking to his offer and I'm not sure I can push him higher. I'll take the $14,000 and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
