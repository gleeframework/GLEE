"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still getting you a great value. Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Alice,5,
