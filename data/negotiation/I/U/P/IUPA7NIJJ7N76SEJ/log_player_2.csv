"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique product, which holds immense value for you. Considering its worth, I am offering it to you for $950,000. This is a special opportunity for you to secure an item that could potentially increase in value over time. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He's only willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and rejecting the offer allows him to start a counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better price.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. I am willing to consider $900,000 for the product, as it still allows us to maintain a fair value while addressing your concerns. I hope this offer aligns more closely with what you're seeking.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  He can buy it from John for $1,000,000, so accepting Alice's offer saves him $100,000. There's a chance he could negotiate further, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price isn't worth it at this point."
