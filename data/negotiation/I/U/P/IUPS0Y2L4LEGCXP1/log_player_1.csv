"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
