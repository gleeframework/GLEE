"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500.  Would you consider $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $11,250 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can reach a price that works for both of us. How about $11,100?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close this deal.",11100.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,200.
