"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to us, but we're open to discussing a fair price. To start, how about we aim for a price between $100 and $120?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for my budget.  Let's try $105. I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we consider $107 as a fair price for the product? This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",107.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $107 is closer, but I'm still a little over my limit. How about we split the difference at $106?  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round.",106.0,Bob,4,
