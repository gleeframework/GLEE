"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  While I know the product is worth $80 to Bob, he might be willing to pay more, especially in the first round.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  However, I'm always keeping the option of selling to John for $150 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is way below my minimum value of $150. While I would prefer a higher profit, I'm not willing to sell for a loss. I'll counteroffer in the next round, trying to reach a compromise closer to my desired price. However, I'm still keeping the option of selling to John for $150 open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering $120. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value of $150. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects again, I'll need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not a great profit. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I am, however, starting to feel the pressure as the rounds go on.  If Bob continues to offer low prices, I might need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm dropping my price again to $100. It's still above my minimum, but I'm getting closer to a point where selling to John might be a better option. I'm hoping this is a price Bob will accept. If not, I might have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, I'm getting close to my minimum value and the rounds are getting limited. It's a small profit, but it's better than risking losing the sale completely.  I'm also considering the possibility that Bob might be willing to pay a little more in the future if we build a good relationship."
