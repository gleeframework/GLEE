This offer gives me a good profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation if he rejects it, allowing me to potentially get even closer to his perceived value."

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I will counteroffer to try and get a better price."
