"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're bringing to the table, $1,350,000 is unfortunately a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product and believe it could be a valuable asset for my operations.  To make this work, I'd like to offer $1,250,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for my company, but I need to stay within a strict budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my financial constraints. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

It represents a fair compromise that maintains a good profit margin for us while being more accessible for your budget.
