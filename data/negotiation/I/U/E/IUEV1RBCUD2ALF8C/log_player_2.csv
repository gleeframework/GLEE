```

**Explanation:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still higher than Bob's preferred price. He has a few rounds left and can continue to negotiate.  He might be able to get a better deal if he keeps trying.  He's also not quite ready to give up and buy from John yet.  The price difference between John and Alice is still significant."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing he's willing to compromise. This offer is a significant step towards Alice's last offer and is still within his budget.  With only two rounds left, Bob wants to see if Alice will accept this offer. He's starting to feel the pressure of time and the possibility of having to buy from John at a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is too high for Bob, especially considering he has only one round left. It's unlikely Alice will significantly lower her price in the final round.  While Bob would prefer to buy from Alice at a lower price, it's more strategic to buy from John for $150 to avoid potentially getting stuck at a price he's not happy with. It's better to pay a bit more and guarantee a deal than to risk being left without a product."
