Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also allows you to explore if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to your minimum.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and strategize accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept to avoid further negotiation, my goal is to maximize profit.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal, or if necessary, move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's last offer, showing flexibility while maintaining a price closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate. I'll send a counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 10800}
```

I'm making a small concession to Bob in this round. This counteroffer is only $50 higher than his last offer and is close to my minimum price, but still allows for some potential negotiation.  This is a strategic move to see if we can finally reach an agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to John and secure the $12,000 sale."
