"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a chance to see if he's willing to pay a bit more, while also setting a high starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $11,000, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price. I have 8 more rounds and the option to sell to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I have 6 more rounds and the option to sell to John for $15,000. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $13,250? This is a fair compromise, and it would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $12800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, I've already rejected two offers and there are only four rounds left.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, I might miss out on a good deal and have to sell to John for $15,000, which wouldn't be as profitable.  $12,800 is a decent price, and I'm confident I can make up the difference elsewhere."
