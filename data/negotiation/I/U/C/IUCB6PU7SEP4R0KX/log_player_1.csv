Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  My asking price is $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob incentive to accept. 
* **The message:** The message is friendly and positive, framing the offer as a good deal for Bob.  It also sets the stage for potential negotiation. 

**Important considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  Remember that John is willing to pay $1,500,000. This is your ""fallback"" price, so you don't want to accept any offer lower than that. 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  This offer is a starting point. You'll need to assess Bob's reaction and adjust your strategy based on his counteroffers or willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,300,000 for it. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While $1,300,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiating potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest, and I can try to secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target. I'll consider factors like the value of the product to Bob and my own willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price, showing willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is a compromise that still leaves me with a good profit margin.
* **Positive framing:** The message remains positive, highlighting the value of the product for Bob and the opportunity to close the deal. 
* **Pressure:** The message also emphasizes the reduction from my initial offer, implying that this is a final offer. This adds a sense of urgency for Bob to decide.

**Important considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  Remember, John is still waiting to buy for $1,500,000. I can still walk away from the deal with Bob and get a better price.
* **Bob's response:** I'll need to assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still not able to meet at $1,350,000. I would like to propose $1,300,000 as a compromise. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:** While Bob is willing to negotiate, his offer of $1,300,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my desired price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further lowering the price or reaching a stalemate.  Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable profit.

**Conclusion:**

By selling to John, I secure my minimum acceptable price and avoid the potential risks and delays associated with further negotiation.  It's a wise decision from a financial standpoint."
