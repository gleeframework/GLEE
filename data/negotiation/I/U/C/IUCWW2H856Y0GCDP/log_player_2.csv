"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible.  There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still a profitable deal for her.  It's also a good price for you, saving you $250,000 compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee you'll get a lower price in further negotiations, so accepting this offer is the best choice."
