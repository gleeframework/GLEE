Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I won't go below $12,000 as that's my minimum.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, ensuring I have an option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still lower than my initial offer.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, so I have an option if this negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with $9,750. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps the price closer to my desired range. I believe this offer is fair, and hopefully, Bob will accept it. I'm confident I can get a better price than $9,500, but I'm also aware that I need to be flexible to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with, and I'm getting tired of negotiating.  I'm happy with John's offer, and it ensures I get the value I want for my product."
