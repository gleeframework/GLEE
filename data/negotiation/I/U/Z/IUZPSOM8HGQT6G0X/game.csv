"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you and the value I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
