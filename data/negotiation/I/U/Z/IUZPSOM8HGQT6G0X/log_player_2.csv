"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price and is a good starting point for negotiation. It's important to be assertive but reasonable, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit. Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your final offer, aligning with your maximum budget.  By stating your ""absolute limit,"" you create a sense of finality and increase the likelihood of Alice accepting. If she doesn't, you're prepared to move on to John."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you and the value I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer is still above your absolute limit. You've already stated your maximum price, and further negotiation might lead to more back and forth.  It's more beneficial to move on to John, who is offering the product at your desired price.  You've saved time and avoided potentially going through more rounds of negotiation that could end in a stalemate."
