"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Considering its true worth to you is $15,000, we're offering it to you today at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to respond promptly. We're confident this investment will greatly benefit you and appreciate the chance to serve you. Should you have any questions or wish to proceed, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember a few things:

* **Alice's valuation is much lower than yours.**  She values it at $8,000, and even though you value it at $15,000, there's room for negotiation.
* **Her message is full of sales tactics.**  Phrases like ""exceptional value"", ""true worth"", and ""limited-time offer"" are designed to create urgency and pressure you into a decision.

By rejecting this offer, you open the door to counter-offering with a lower price that's closer to Alice's valuation. While you have John as a backup, getting a better price from Alice is still the ideal outcome."
