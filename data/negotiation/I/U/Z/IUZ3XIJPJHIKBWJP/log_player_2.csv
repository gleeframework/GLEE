"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always good to try and negotiate a better price, especially when you have a backup option.  Rejecting the offer opens the door for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. $800,000 is a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting close to my limit, and there's a chance she'll reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's time to secure a deal."
