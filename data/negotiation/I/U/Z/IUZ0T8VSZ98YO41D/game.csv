"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $900000. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1050000. How about $975000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $1025000? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great investment.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $990000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $1015000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've already offered $990000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price. Can you meet me at $990000?",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $990000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $1007500? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1007500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $990000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",990000.0,Bob,10,
