"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds tremendous value for your business, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits us both.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $900,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it falls short of the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's potential for your business, while also showing my willingness to compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than where I can comfortably go. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in it.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
