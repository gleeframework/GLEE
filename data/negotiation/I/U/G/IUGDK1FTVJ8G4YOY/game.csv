,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. I'm willing to go down to $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and a good price for both of us. What do you say?",9750.0,Alice,5,
