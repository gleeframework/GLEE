Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for more, Bob is firm at $1,050,000. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $50,000. Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's $1,000,000. It's better to secure a good profit now than risk losing it."
