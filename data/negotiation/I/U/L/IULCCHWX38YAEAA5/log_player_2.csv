"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the price I was initially thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, even though it's closer to what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to push for a lower price one more time. If she rejects my next offer, I'll buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm happy to pay $1,250,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $1,280,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that Alice is not going to go any lower. At this point, it's more advantageous for me to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  I'll save $280,000 by going with John, even if it means losing out on the opportunity to potentially negotiate an even lower price with Alice."
