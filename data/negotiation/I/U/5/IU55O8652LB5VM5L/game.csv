"Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to let you have it for $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal. Let me know if you're interested!",8500.0,Alice,1,
