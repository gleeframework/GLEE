Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $12,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product is considerably higher. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $13,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,250. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

While I could continue negotiating, Bob seems firm on his final offer. Accepting $13,500 is a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of ending up with John's offer of $10,000."
