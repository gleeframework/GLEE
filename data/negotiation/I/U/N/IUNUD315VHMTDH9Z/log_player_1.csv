"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price point before potentially going lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counteroffer at $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident you'll find this product worth it at that price."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
