"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product for $1,000,000 from John, saving $200,000."
