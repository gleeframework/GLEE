Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price, leaving room for concessions.  This allows you to appear flexible while still aiming for a high profit. 
* **Near Bob's Value:**  Offering the product close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) increases the chances of him accepting or countering with a still-profitable price for you.
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping the option to sell to John for $800,000 gives you a strong bottom line. You'll never accept a price from Bob that falls below this safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good profit, it's still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more and open the door for a counteroffer closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product's true value is closer to $1,050,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We've made a significant concession from our initial offer of $1,100,000, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Middle Ground:** By suggesting a price of $1,050,000, we're aiming for a compromise that's still well above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Maintaining Value:** Our message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we settle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $975,000 is a very good offer, exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) by a significant margin. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could try to negotiate for more, further haggling might irritate Bob and risk the deal. The potential gain from pushing for a slightly higher price is outweighed by the risk of losing the sale altogether.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal quickly also has value. Accepting this offer ensures we get paid promptly."
