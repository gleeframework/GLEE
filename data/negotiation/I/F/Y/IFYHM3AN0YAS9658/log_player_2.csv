"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1100000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a successful deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still below what I consider to be a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a profit.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $1,050,000 is significantly less than $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation may be risky:** Alice has already come down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000.  It's likely she won't budge much further.
* **Compromise is key:** Accepting this offer allows Bob to achieve his goal of saving money while also reaching a mutually agreeable price."
