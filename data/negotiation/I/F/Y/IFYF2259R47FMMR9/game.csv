"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $6000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500? This would still be a good deal for you and allow me to recover some of the value. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $7200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $7200.  Let's try $7800 as a final offer. This will allow me to recover a good portion of the value of the product while remaining within your budget.",7800.0,Alice,5,
