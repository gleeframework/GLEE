Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $150 offers a good balance. It's a significant markup from your minimum, but not so high that it's likely to scare Bob away without consideration.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he wants the product but finds the price a bit high."
