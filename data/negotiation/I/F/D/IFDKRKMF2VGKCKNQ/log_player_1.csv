Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a little room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring we get more than John's offer if he accepts.
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is straightforward and highlights the potential value to Bob."
