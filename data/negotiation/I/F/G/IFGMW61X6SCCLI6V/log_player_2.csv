"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is way above his budget.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to buy the product for his maximum budget of $800,000. This is a strong opening counteroffer, leaving little room for further negotiation while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk is that Alice may not be willing to go lower, and the negotiation could drag on. Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's more efficient and risk-free to buy from John."
