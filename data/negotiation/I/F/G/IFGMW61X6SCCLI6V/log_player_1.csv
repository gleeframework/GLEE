Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob.  This forces Bob to make the first counteroffer, giving me some insight into his willingness to pay.  If he rejects, I can always turn to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is too far off. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss. It also gives Bob room to move closer to my target without feeling forced."
