Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying above the $10,000 minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the price.

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, Alice increases the likelihood of a sale at a price significantly higher than her backup offer from John."
