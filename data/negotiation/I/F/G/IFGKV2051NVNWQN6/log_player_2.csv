"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $25,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $25,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $15,000.  It's better to counteroffer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25,000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $15,000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $25,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $15,000. I can meet you in the middle at $20,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $20,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his limit. He can still get the product from John for $15,000. He should continue negotiating or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $20,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product is worth $15,000, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make that work.  Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
