"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your operations. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm eager to work with you, $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet at $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this opportunity.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, which is the maximum I can go without exceeding my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough to cover my costs and allow me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $1,200,000.  Let's meet at $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that ensures we both get a positive outcome.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,200,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
