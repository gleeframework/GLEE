"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and my ability to pay. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
