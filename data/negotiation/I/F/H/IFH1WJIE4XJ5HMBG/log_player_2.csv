"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  My asking price is $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential for growth. I'm open to discussing this further, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair starting point given we both have room to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $1,250,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about we meet at $1,150,000?  I feel this is a fair offer, especially considering I'm coming to the table ready to close."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum.  However, I value our continued negotiations.  Let's bridge the gap at $1,200,000.  This price is fair, as it allows me to meet my minimum while still offering you a product that will be highly valuable to your business.  I'm confident you won't regret this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best deal Bob is likely to get. Alice has reached her minimum, and Bob is getting a significant discount.  There's no guarantee of a better price with further negotiation."
