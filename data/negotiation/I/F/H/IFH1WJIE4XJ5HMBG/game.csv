"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  My asking price is $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential for growth. I'm open to discussing this further, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair starting point given we both have room to negotiate.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $1,250,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about we meet at $1,150,000?  I feel this is a fair offer, especially considering I'm coming to the table ready to close.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum.  However, I value our continued negotiations.  Let's bridge the gap at $1,200,000.  This price is fair, as it allows me to meet my minimum while still offering you a product that will be highly valuable to your business.  I'm confident you won't regret this investment.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
