Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum acceptable price is $100 and I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John and make a profit. This gives Bob an incentive to accept if the product is worth more to him than $150."
