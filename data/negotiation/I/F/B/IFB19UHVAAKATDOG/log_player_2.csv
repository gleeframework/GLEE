"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is below your maximum budget, you can get a better deal from John. Rejecting this offer might push Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $800,000. If she doesn't, you're still secured by John's offer of $1,000,000."
