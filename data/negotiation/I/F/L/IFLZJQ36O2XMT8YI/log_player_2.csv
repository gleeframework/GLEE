Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  Would you be willing to do $110 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly better than John's $100 offer within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
