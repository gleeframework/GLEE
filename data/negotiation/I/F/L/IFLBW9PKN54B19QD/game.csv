"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a better deal.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let's find a way to make this work.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $98. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can make a deal.",98.0,Bob,4,
