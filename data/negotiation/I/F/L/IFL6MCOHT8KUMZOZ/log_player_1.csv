{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm aiming to get as much as possible, but also want to be reasonable and avoid losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is close to my desired price and it's above my minimum. Accepting his offer will secure a sale and maximize my profit."
