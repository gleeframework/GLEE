,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $115. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can wrap up the deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
