Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,200,000. I'm willing to part with it for $1,600,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. "", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000 gives me leverage. I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price that's significantly profitable for me.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have some time and Bob is a motivated buyer. If time is of the essence, I might offer a lower price to ensure a quick sale."
