"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal as it's worth much more to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to establish a starting point significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her willingness to move on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This still leaves you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll reject this offer to see if we can push a little further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for a budget under $8,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000 even?"",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This counter-offer aims to land directly on the known value of the product to Alice. It signals that we're serious about the purchase but also aware of a fair price point. There's a chance she'll accept, and if not, it sets us up for a final negotiation round."
