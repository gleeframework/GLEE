"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the market value.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not comfortable with $925000. I'm willing to go as low as $950000, but I think that's the absolute minimum I can accept. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",950000.0,Alice,5,
