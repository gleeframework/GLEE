Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than your minimum, but still below Bob's perceived value. This allows for negotiation space while maximizing potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price. Rejecting this offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially close the gap closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from your previous offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is lower than you initially aimed for, it's still above your minimum of $80 and a reasonable compromise.  Given that Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate down, continuing to reject offers could risk him walking away entirely.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and a profit."
