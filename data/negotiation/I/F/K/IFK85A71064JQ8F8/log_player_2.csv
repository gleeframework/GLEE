# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's a fair and reasonable offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While Alice is trying to make it seem like a good deal because it's below the product's value to Bob, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob can get the product from John for $1,000,000, saving him $200,000."
