"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $800,000?  This is my absolute minimum, and it would allow us to both benefit from the sale.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
