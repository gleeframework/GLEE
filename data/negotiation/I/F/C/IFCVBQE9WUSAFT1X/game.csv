"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $17500?  I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable, and I'm eager to make this deal work.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $14000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this deal happen.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $13000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $13500? This is my absolute lowest price.  It's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this transaction.",13500.0,Alice,7,
