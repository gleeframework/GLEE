```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$10,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $17,500?  I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable, and I'm eager to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 17500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $14,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 14000}
