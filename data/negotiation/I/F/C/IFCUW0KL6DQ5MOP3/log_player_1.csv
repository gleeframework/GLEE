Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating its worth to you, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is valuable and justifies the higher price.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  By saying ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you haven't lost anything and can always revert to John, ensuring you get your minimum price."
