Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I believe I can get a better deal with more negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $10,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $10,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,750 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's aim for $11,000. It's a small increase from your last offer, and it would allow me to close this deal without losing too much. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $10,500? I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

While I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation and pushing for a higher price. I'm confident I can secure a better price in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,750 is the best I can do.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that I'll be able to reach my desired price point with Bob. He's clearly not willing to budge much further, and I don't want to risk ending up with a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.  

John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, which is my minimum.  It's better to secure this guaranteed deal rather than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
