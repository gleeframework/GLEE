"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This initial offer is a bit aggressive but still leaves room for negotiation. It's high enough to maximize potential profit, but it's also below my minimum acceptable price, giving me some wiggle room. I'll be prepared to counter if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it for $9,150.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I believe I can get a slightly better price with further negotiation, so I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,900 just doesn't cover my costs.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my expenses while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,700 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating. While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offers are not getting closer to my minimum price.  It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and I'm not confident we'll reach a deal. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000."
