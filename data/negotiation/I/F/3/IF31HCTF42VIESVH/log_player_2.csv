"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to make a fair offer to start. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm working with a tight budget and $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (approximately 28% less) leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Anchoring:** This offer sets a lower anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Alice doesn't accept this price outright, it influences her perception of what might be an acceptable price range. 
* **Time Consideration:** I have ten rounds, so starting lower allows for some back-and-forth. I can gradually increase my offer if needed while still aiming to stay well below John's $8,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room:** Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still closer to her starting point than mine. 
* **John as Leverage:**  I have John's offer as a safety net, so I can afford to push for a better price from Alice.

I'll aim to counter a bit below $7,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're serious about making a deal. How about we settle at $6,900? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 6900
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increment:**  I'm increasing my offer, but only slightly (about 6%). This shows willingness to move but emphasizes that I'm still looking for a significant discount.
* **Psychological Price Point:** $6,900 feels significantly lower than $7,000, potentially making it more appealing to Alice.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  Keeping the negotiation moving prevents stagnation and signals my genuine interest in closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $6,900 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $7,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer & Proximity to John:** Alice has declared this her final offer, and it's only $200 less than John's price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings at this point. It's possible Alice won't budge further, and even if she does, the difference might be negligible.
* **Time Value & Certainty:**  Buying from John guarantees the price and ends the negotiation process. This saves time and eliminates the risk of Alice not moving further on her price."
