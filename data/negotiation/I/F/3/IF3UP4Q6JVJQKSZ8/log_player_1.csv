Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is truly significant and  $750,000 is too low for me to consider.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $975,000?

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's clear he's trying to get a bargain. It's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000 quickly.  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is the minimum I'm willing to accept."
