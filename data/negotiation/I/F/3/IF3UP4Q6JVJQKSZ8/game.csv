"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is truly significant and  $750,000 is too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
