"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm confident it will be highly valuable for your business as well. My initial offer is $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $800000 on this purchase. Would you consider a counteroffer closer to this amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is significantly below the value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to recover a more reasonable amount for the product.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my budget and the value I believe the product holds, I would like to propose an offer of $950000. This still allows us to find common ground while staying within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your persistence in this negotiation.  While $950000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. Considering my budget and the value I see in the product, I would like to propose an offer of $1000000. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
