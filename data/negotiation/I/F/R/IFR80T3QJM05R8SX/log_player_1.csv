"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and I know you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of a good deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob would get from the product,  making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open Communication:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, encouraging negotiation and building rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, his message indicates he's interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. 
* **More Rounds to Explore:**  I have 10 rounds to try and reach a better deal. I can use the next round to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Sort of):** My counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise. While not exactly halfway, it's a step towards Bob's desired price, but still significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** My message focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us. This helps maintain a positive tone and encourages further negotiation.
* **Maintain My Value:**  I'm staying above my minimum price point of $15,000 while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns. This shows I'm flexible but still value my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Significant Value Difference:** There is still a $4,500 difference between Bob's offer and my minimum. This leaves room for further negotiation.
* **More Rounds to Explore:** I have 6 rounds left to try and reach a better deal that's closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still working within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,750? It's closer to your offer, and it's a price I can accept. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** My offer of $11,750 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's current offer of $10,500. This demonstrates a commitment to finding a compromise and shows good faith in the negotiation.
* **Positive Language:**  I use positive language like ""let's get this deal done"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage a final decision.
* **Balancing Value:**  My offer is still significantly above Bob's initial offer, but it's below my desired value, creating a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous offer, which would be $10750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Closing the Gap:** While the gap is narrowing, there's still a significant difference between our desired prices. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I have several rounds left, and I want to use them strategically. Rejecting this offer will allow me to counter with a slightly higher price, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, but I'm still not quite there with your offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again,  at $11,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle Again:**  This offer is a compromise, precisely halfway between my previous offer ($11,750) and Bob's latest offer ($10,750). This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that this offer is still a good deal.
* **Creating Urgency:** The phrase ""Let's close this deal!"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob toward accepting a deal before he loses the opportunity.
* **Strategically Staying Above Minimum:**  While this offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it still leaves some room for negotiation. I have a few rounds left to try and close the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go as high as $10800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that I'll be able to reach my desired price point. 
* **Significant Value Difference:**  There's still a significant gap between Bob's offer ($10,800) and my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John is offering my desired price, guaranteeing a sale without further negotiation and potential for a deal falling through. 

While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of Bob rejecting my offer in the next round and losing out on a guaranteed sale with John outweighs the potential benefit of continuing to negotiate. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
