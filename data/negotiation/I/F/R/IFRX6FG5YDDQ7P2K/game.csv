"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is your maximum budget, but I still believe the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
