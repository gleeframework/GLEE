,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $7,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,875.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal!",7875.0,Alice,5,
