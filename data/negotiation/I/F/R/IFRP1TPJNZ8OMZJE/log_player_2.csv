"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer ready to pay $1,200,000.  This is a great opportunity to acquire this product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her asking price, it's still higher than the price John is offering.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving $150,000."
