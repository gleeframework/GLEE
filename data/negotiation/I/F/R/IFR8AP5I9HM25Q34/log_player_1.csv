Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation while still leaving room for me to potentially make a profit beyond my minimum of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I don't want to settle for the bare minimum right away. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and while I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from him.  John is offering a guaranteed $8,000, which meets my minimum, so it's the safest choice."
