Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $800,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price, especially since I know John is willing to pay $800,000. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $900,000. This is still higher than John's offer, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't accept a price far below what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $600,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, it's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price expectations.  It's time to move on and secure the $800,000 offer from John."
