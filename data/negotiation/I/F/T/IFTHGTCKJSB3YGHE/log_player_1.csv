Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. It's worth pushing further to see if we can get closer to at least $1.3 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a suitable price point. While $1,250,000 is a respectable offer, it falls short of reflecting the true value this product holds.  To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $1,310,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $1,250,000 is a fair price. I'm not willing to go above that. Can we meet at $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

While ideally, we'd like to get closer to $1.3 million, Bob seems firm on his upper limit. Accepting his offer of $1,275,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away completely."
