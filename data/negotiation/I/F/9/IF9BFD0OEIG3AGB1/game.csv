,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $95 is the best price. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle at $90?,85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible. I'm willing to drop my price a little more to $90.  Let's meet in the middle, and I'm confident we can finalize this.",90.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to pay $90. I'd be willing to meet you at $85, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,6,
