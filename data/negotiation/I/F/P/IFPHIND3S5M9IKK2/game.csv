"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low. The value of this product is significant, and I'm willing to compromise, but not that much. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,100,000. It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
