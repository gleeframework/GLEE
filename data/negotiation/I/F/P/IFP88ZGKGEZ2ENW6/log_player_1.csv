"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting high gives me room to negotiate down without feeling like I'm losing too much. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I emphasize the product's worth to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 

**Important Note:**  While I'm aiming high, I'm aware that I have a fallback option with John. This allows me to be firm in my negotiations and not settle for an unacceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way too high. I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum value it holds for me. Let's start our negotiation from here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's simply not worth selling at that price.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is low,  I'm willing to continue negotiating in hopes of finding a more agreeable price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while still leaving room for further negotiation.  I'll be strategic and consider the remaining rounds, making sure to balance my desire for a good price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply not enough. Considering the value this product holds for you,  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, hoping to convince him that the price is justified.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  $1,200,000 is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, but still well above my minimum acceptable price.  It leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and cooperative tone to encourage Bob to engage in further discussion.

**Strategy:**

By making a reasonable counteroffer, I'm hoping to keep the negotiation moving forward. I'm also carefully considering the remaining rounds, making sure that I don't settle too quickly for a price that is significantly below my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's closer, it's not enough to justify selling at this point.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  We're making progress, and I believe there's still potential to reach a better price. 
* **John is a Safeguard:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, knowing I can secure a much better deal with John if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll need to be strategic to maximize my profit while acknowledging the limited rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far off from what this product is truly worth.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Progress:** I'm continuing to demonstrate flexibility by coming down from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Midpoint Approach:** $1,075,000 is the midpoint between my last offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's current offer ($950,000). This presents a neutral and reasonable starting point for further negotiation.
* **Urgency & Finality:** I emphasize the need to ""close this deal now"" to create a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to accept the offer.  This is particularly important as we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Satisfaction:** I appeal to Bob's desire for a satisfying deal by framing the offer as a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while also ensuring that I don't sell too low.  I'm now willing to go slightly below my initial minimum, but I'm still confident that I can secure a good price. With only five rounds left,  I'll need to be more decisive in my negotiations to secure the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows us to come to an agreement.  Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Even though we're getting close, it's not enough to justify selling at this point.
* **Negotiation Continues:** We're making progress, but I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds remaining, the pressure is on to reach a good deal, but I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my desired value.
* **John is a Safeguard:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, knowing I can secure a much better deal with John if necessary. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll need to be strategic to maximize my profit, but I'm confident that I can secure a better price without jeopardizing the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer you the product for $1,025,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Progress:** I'm continuing to demonstrate flexibility by coming down from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Midpoint Approach:** $1,025,000 is the midpoint between my last offer ($1,075,000) and Bob's current offer ($975,000). This presents a neutral and reasonable starting point for further negotiation.
* **Urgency & Finality:**  I emphasize the need to find a solution ""quickly"" and highlight the limited time remaining to create a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to accept.
* **Focus on Shared Solution:** I emphasize the need for a solution that ""works for both of us"", appealing to Bob's desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while also ensuring that I don't sell too low. With only three rounds remaining, I'm making a final push to reach a price that is closer to my desired value, but still acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand we are both trying to reach a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price that allows us to close the deal and avoids the need to go through further rounds.  Let's finalize this now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's getting closer, it's not enough to justify selling at this point, especially with John's offer as a safety net.
* **Negotiation Continues:** We're making good progress, and I believe there's still potential to reach a higher price with only two rounds remaining.
* **Limited Rounds:**  Time is becoming a factor, but I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my desired value. 
* **John is a Safeguard:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, knowing I can secure a much better deal with John if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to make a final counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll need to be strategic to maximize my profit while acknowledging the limited rounds remaining."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me halfway. $1,000,000 is a good offer, but I need to be closer to my target price to make this work.  Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  This is my final offer,  so let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by offering a price that's in the middle between my last offer ($1,025,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000).
* **Urgency & Finality:**  I emphasize the finality of the offer to create a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to accept. It's crucial to avoid losing the deal in the final round.
* **Focus on Win-Win:**  I appeal to Bob's desire for a satisfying deal by framing the offer as a win-win scenario, where both parties get a good outcome.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only one round left, I need to close the deal while still securing a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It's a final push for a price closer to my desired value while acknowledging the limited time remaining. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely need to sell to John to secure a better price, as it's unlikely that a more favorable offer will emerge in the final round."
