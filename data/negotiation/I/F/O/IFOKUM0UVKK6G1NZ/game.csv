"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the value it holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is sufficient. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have a minimum price, but $1,100,000 is still out of my reach. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This represents a considerable increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product.  I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Bob,6,
