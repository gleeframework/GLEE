"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it represents a compelling deal for you. I understand this is a big decision, so feel free to ask any questions you may have. If you decide not to proceed, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price.
