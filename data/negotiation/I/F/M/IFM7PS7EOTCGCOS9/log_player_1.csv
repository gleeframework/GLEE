Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know you'll find it valuable."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($12,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves a potential $1,000 profit for Bob while securing a $2,000 profit for you. This is a win-win scenario that encourages Bob to accept.
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so you don't need to go below that price."
