"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. This is the last offer I can make, and I hope we can finalize the deal here.",800000.0,Alice,5,
