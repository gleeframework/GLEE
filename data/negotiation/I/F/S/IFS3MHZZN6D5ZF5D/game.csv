"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $75?  I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate. I propose a price of $90 for the product. This still reflects its value, but I hope it aligns better with your current financial situation. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to suggest another price.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm really interested in this product, but $90 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend. Would you consider $80? I think it would be a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
