Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it at $150 to guarantee a sale, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is close enough to John's offer ($150) that it minimizes potential losses if Bob rejects the offer. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision."
