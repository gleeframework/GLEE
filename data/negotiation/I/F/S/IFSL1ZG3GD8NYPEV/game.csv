"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm still pretty set on something closer to $7,000. Would you be open to meeting me there?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This is a significant discount from my original asking price and a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
