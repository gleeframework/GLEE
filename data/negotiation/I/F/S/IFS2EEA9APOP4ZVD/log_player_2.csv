You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than your $15,000 maximum budget. While you could reject her offer hoping for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll go lower and you risk having to buy from John at the highest price. Accepting this offer secures a savings of $1,500."
