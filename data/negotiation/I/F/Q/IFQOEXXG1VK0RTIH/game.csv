"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
