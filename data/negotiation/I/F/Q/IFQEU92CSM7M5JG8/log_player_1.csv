Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features, I'm initially offering it at $20,000. However, I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, I start with a high offer ($20,000) to establish a negotiation space. This leaves room to decrease the price while still aiming for a profit above John's offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's unique features and value to Bob aims to justify the initial price and potentially shift his perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By stating my willingness to discuss the price, I encourage Bob to engage in negotiation and potentially reveal his budget limitations.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, which serves as my minimum acceptable price. Any agreement with Bob must exceed this amount. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while considering Bob's potential rejection."
