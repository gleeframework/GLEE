"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiations.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm confident we can close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
