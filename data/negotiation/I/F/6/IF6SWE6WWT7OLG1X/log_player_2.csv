"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. 
* You have 9 more rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?  I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows my seriousness in negotiating and gives room for compromise. 
* **Motivating language:** I use phrases like ""interested in the product"" and ""work something out"" to emphasize my genuine interest and willingness to collaborate.
* **Realistic offer:** $9,000 is still a reasonable price, as it's within my budget and leaves some room for Alice to make a counteroffer if needed.
* **Building a foundation:**  This counteroffer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation,  hopefully leading to a win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** Alice's offer of $10,500 is still slightly above my maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a lower price, especially since I'm willing to go up to $10,000. 
* **Time on my side:** We are still early in the negotiation process, with 7 rounds remaining.  It's worth trying to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing commitment:** I reiterate my willingness to pay $10,000, demonstrating my serious interest. 
* **Finality:**  The phrase ""absolute limit"" implies that this is my best offer. This creates a sense of urgency for Alice to consider it.
* **Positive language:** Using ""make this happen"" focuses on a collaborative approach and a positive outcome. 
* **Testing the waters:** I'm testing to see if Alice is willing to accept my maximum offer."
