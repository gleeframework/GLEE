"Bob,  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you want a good deal, but I'm also looking to get a fair price for my product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about we compromise at $1,075,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to save as much as possible.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
