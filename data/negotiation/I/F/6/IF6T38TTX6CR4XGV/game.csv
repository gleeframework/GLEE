"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference: I'll offer you $11500. This is a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, which is still below my initial price but closer to what I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",12500.0,Alice,5,
