Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $100, I want to aim slightly higher to see if I can get a better price than my guaranteed sale to John.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $20 markup (20% increase) is a reasonable starting point. It allows room for negotiation while still being a price Bob might consider. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"":**  This phrasing adds a touch of urgency and perceived value, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept."
