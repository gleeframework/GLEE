Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you, I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's within Bob's range:** $14,000 is less than the product's value to Bob ($15,000), making it likely he'll consider it.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still space for Bob to counteroffer without you having to immediately accept a price below your minimum ($10,000). 
* **It's a fair starting point:**  $14,000 is significantly more than your minimum ($10,000), but also acknowledges that Bob has a potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy it for $12,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and the product's value to Bob. By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:** Show Bob you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Potential for higher price:** A counteroffer could lead to a price closer to your ideal $14,000 or even higher. 
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  His willingness to negotiate further reveals how keen he is on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $12,500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

This counteroffer is strategically designed:

* **Compromise:** It's a clear signal of willingness to negotiate, but not at a significant loss for you.
* **Fairness:** $13,250 is closer to your ideal price than Bob's offer, and still gives him a good deal.
* **Motivation:** The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" and ""making this deal work,"" aiming to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  While $12,800 is still below your ideal price, it's very close to your minimum.  Considering:

* **Bob's likely limit:** He's already been willing to pay more than his minimum ($10,000). Further negotiation might be fruitless.
* **Potential for a deal:** $12,800 is a significant gain for you over selling to John.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject, Bob could walk away, leaving you only with John's offer.

Therefore, it's better to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale at a price that's acceptable and above your minimum."
