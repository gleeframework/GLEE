Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $150 as possible, knowing we have John as a backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 gives Bob the impression of a deal and potentially leaves room for him to counter-offer, while still staying above our minimum price. 
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:**  If we go too low initially, Bob might think the product is worth less or we are desperate to sell."
