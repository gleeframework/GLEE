"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's significantly below its true worth. While I value it at no less than $1,200,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay full price.  Consider this a chance to secure a remarkable asset at a very attractive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
