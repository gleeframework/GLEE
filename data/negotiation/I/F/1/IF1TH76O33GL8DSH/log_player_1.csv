{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount for me, but still leaves me with a profit. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for Bob, highlighting the potential for him to get a good deal. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a quick deal, but I'm open to negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer, but I'll also be mindful of the time spent and the opportunity cost of selling to John for $1,500,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm not in a rush and am willing to negotiate further. I'll counteroffer Bob to try and find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a substantial discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm increasing the price from $1,000,000 to $1,100,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing that it's too low. I'm presenting the counteroffer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Strategy:**  I'm trying to find a middle ground. This counteroffer gives Bob a better deal than before while still ensuring I earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a compromise, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I've already made a significant concession.  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risk of wasting more time and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  John is a guaranteed buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price, so it's more efficient and less risky to sell to him."
