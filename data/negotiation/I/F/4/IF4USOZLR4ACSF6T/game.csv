"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $130?  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $135? That's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if that works for you!",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $132.50.  Let me know if that works for you!",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $132.50 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm ready to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $133.75? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",133.75,Alice,5,
