Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position that gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to give in this easily. I believe the product is worth more and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a significant amount of money and reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. While I'd still prefer to get closer to $900,000, $850,000 is a good compromise and ensures I get a better price than John's offer."
