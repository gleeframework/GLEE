"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I can't go lower than $1,400,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,250,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can agree on this.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
