You should reject Alice's offer. $9,500 is still more than you are willing to spend, and there is room to negotiate.  You can make a counteroffer to try and get a better price."

While $8,900 is closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum of $8,000.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it's the most financially sound decision to go with John and avoid further negotiation."
