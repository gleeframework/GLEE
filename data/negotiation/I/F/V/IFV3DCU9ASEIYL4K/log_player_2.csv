Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11250. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and the effort I've put into finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and while he'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $11,250 is now below his maximum desired price of $12,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product while still saving $3,750 compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable compromise, especially since further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or result in Alice going back to her initial price."
