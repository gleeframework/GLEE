"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product for a price of $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is way out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about we discuss a price of $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000. It's my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",10000.0,Bob,4,
