"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $80.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers. I'm also trying to build rapport by saying it's a ""great deal"" and emphasizing the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make an offer of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  $90 is still a good price for me, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is my absolute bottom line.  This is a high-quality product that you'll be happy with for years to come."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm open to negotiation, but I'm still trying to get as close to my original asking price as possible. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that it's a high-quality product, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. I'd like to make an offer of $92. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While $92 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  I'm not willing to go lower than $93, as that's truly the minimum I can accept.  Let's try to make this deal happen. "", ""product_price"": 93}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to show I'm flexible, but I'm staying firm at $93. I'm also trying to build a sense of urgency by suggesting it's time to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'd like to make an offer of $91. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is getting close to my minimum and I'm getting concerned about losing the deal with Bob entirely.  $91 is a reasonable price, and I'm not sure I can get much more from him. I'd rather accept this offer than risk selling to John for less."
