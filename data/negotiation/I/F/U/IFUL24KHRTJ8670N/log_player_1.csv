{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob if he's interested. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit while keeping the possibility of a deal with John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not ready to settle for a price below what I consider the product's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $10,500. This is still a great price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum threshold.  It's also the same price I could get from John, so accepting Bob's offer secures the sale and avoids any further negotiation."
