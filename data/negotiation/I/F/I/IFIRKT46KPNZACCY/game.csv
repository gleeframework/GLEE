"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in this product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,200. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $8,800? That way we both get a good deal.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,800 just yet. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting really close!  I'm very serious about buying this, but I need to stay under $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,900?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,100, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with the product.",9100.0,Alice,7,
