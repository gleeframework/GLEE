"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise. I'm confident Bob will counter-offer, and we can work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to secure a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm now proposing my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and I'm willing to sell the product for this price. I'm confident Bob will see the value in this deal, as it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to take $825,000, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I have several rounds left and the option to sell to John, so I'm in a strong position to continue negotiating. I want to see if I can get closer to my $1,000,000 goal before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $950,000, acknowledging Bob's strong stance. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. I believe this offer is fair and will likely lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We're approaching the halfway point in our negotiations, and while Bob has shown some willingness to budge, he's still far from my desired price.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity."
