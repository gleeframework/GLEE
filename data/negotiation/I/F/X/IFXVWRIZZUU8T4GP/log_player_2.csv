# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

You're still able to get a better deal than $950,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get closer to your target price."

Alice is getting closer to your target price, and you're getting a good deal at $925,000.  It's worth accepting the offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John at a much higher price."
