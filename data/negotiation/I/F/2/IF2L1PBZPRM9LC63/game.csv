"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to buy the product today if you can come down to $13,000.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, and I'm happy to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13,500 is still a little above my budget. Would you consider $13,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to buy the product today.",13250.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $13,000, which is the same price you initially offered. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
