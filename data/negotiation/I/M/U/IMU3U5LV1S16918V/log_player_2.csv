"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident its value to you will be even greater. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to her.  There's room for negotiation to save money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This feels like a good compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
