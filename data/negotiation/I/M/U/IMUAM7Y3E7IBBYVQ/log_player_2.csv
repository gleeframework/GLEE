"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if a better deal can be reached before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $850,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit high. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if Alice will come down further. There are still several rounds left, and Bob can always buy from John for $800,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. "", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $825,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, considering the value the product holds for me. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unwilling to budge much further.  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's starting to look like Alice is going to be a tough negotiator.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John at $800,000 to avoid the risk of further rounds and potentially higher prices from Alice."
