"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  Unfortunately, that price is a little too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is substantially lower than Alice's asking price, but it's important to start with a significant counter to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Reaction:**  This counteroffer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be.  If she outright rejects it, we know we need to move closer to her price range. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have the option of going with John for $8,000, so we don't want to settle for anything close to that price from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider something closer to $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice has come down slightly, but $10,000 is still her perceived value and above both our budget and John's offer.
* **Room to Negotiate:** There are still seven rounds left, so we have time to see if we can get Alice closer to our desired price range.
* **John as Backup:** We maintain the security of John's offer if negotiations fail to reach a satisfactory agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm definitely willing to come up a bit. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer, and it shows I'm serious about buying."", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows movement towards Alice's price while still staying below our maximum budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By increasing the offer by $1,000, we demonstrate that we're willing to negotiate seriously but won't budge too much further.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We are still aiming for a price significantly lower than John's offer to ensure the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you moving in my direction. To be honest, I need to get at least $9,000 for this product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches John's Offer:** Alice has come down to $8,000, which is the same price John is offering. 
* **No Guarantee of Lower Price:** Continuing negotiations might not result in a lower price, and there's a risk Alice might increase her offer again. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now saves time and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
