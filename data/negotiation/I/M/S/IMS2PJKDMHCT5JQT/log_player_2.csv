Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
