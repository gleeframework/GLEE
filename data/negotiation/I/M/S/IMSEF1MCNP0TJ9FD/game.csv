"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $18000 at this time. If you're open to negotiation, let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $22000. I think this price is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, while also being more in line with your budget.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $22000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $20000? I think this would be a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.",20000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $20000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer it to you for $21500. I think this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",21500.0,Alice,5,
