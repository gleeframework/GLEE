"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to get as much as possible from Bob. If he rejects, I'll have to see how determined he is and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$120 is still below my minimum, and I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate.  I'll see if I can push Bob higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but I'm still well above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is getting close to my minimum of $150.  I'd rather not risk losing a sale to John, so I'll take the $140 and close the deal."
