Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This allows room for negotiation and potentially earns me a higher price. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest level and adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
