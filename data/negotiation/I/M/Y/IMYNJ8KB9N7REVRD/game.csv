"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $900000 to make this deal work. This price still gives you a good value, and allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment. Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000. This price reflects the true value of the product while still allowing you a good deal. Let's finalize this transaction.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However,  $875000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $900000. This offers a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,7,
