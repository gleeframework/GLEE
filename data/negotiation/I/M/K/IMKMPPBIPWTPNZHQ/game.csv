"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for some room for compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's closer to my minimum.  I believe this offer is a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but $11,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair given the product's value and the progress we've made in our negotiations. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $11,200 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",10900.0,Bob,8,
