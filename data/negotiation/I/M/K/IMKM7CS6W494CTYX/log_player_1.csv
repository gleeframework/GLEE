"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to my ideal price, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to see if Bob is truly interested in the product at a price closer to its worth to him."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still below what I'd like to earn. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is getting close to what John would pay, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him a bit further.  There's still time left in the negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for a lower price yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm starting to run out of time.  Bob seems unwilling to budge much higher, and I don't want to risk going another round and ending up with an even lower offer. I'm going to sell to John for $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a significant amount and I'm guaranteed to sell the product."
