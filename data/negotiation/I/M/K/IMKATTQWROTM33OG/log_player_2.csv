Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What are your thoughts?

While $1,050,000 is better than $1,200,000, it's still above your desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.

Alice is not budging much further, and her latest offer is still above your preferred price point. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will just waste time, and you're better off buying from John for the price you're comfortable with."
