Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $12,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the price. Even if he wants to negotiate, he's likely to offer a price closer to $12,000 than $8,000.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000. This gives you leverage to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price you're comfortable with."
