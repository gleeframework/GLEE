Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you'll make a profit and are not giving the product away too cheaply.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

By starting at $10,000, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially close a deal quickly. If he rejects the offer, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer or, if necessary, move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than what the product is worth to me.  I'll send a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $10,000 to make this work. How about $9,500? "", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground by lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum value.  This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while also showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer and see if we can finally reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

I'm trying to push for a price closer to my desired outcome while still being reasonable. Offering a middle ground price demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
