"Hi Alice, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $10,000 to make this work. How about $9,500? ",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
