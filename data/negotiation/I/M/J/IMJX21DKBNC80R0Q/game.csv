"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a price that's hard to beat. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if you're interested.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit high for me. How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can do $110, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",110.0,Alice,5,
