"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a price that's hard to beat. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit.  I'll reject and counteroffer again, hoping to find a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit high for me. How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can do $110, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $80.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems she's not willing to come down significantly. To avoid further negotiation and potential deadlock, I'll purchase the product from John at $80. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
