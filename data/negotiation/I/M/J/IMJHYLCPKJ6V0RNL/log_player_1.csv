Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm willing to let it go for $119."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you imply Bob might miss out if he doesn't act now.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While unlikely, the $119 offer leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down a dollar or two. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119.  He might try to negotiate lower, or he might reject it outright. If he rejects it, you have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum price."
