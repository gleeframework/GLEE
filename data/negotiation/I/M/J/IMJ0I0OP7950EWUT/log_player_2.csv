Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering the product at my maximum valuation, and it's the same price I can get from John. There's no point in further negotiation or going with John."
