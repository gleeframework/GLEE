"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay no more than $750,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. ",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too far apart. How about we compromise at $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us, as it's the minimum I'm willing to sell for, and it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's finalize this deal!",800000.0,Alice,5,
