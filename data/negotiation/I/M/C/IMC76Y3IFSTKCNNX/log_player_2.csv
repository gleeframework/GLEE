"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a discounted price, and I get to sell it quickly. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
