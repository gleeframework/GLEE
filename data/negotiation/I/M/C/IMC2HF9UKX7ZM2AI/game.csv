"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to make a profit.  Let's work together to make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire the product at a competitive price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a strong offer that allows for both of us to walk away with a reasonable profit.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see that you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer the product to you for $980,000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire the product. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise.  However,  $980,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gives us both a good profit, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.  Let's get this done.",960000.0,Bob,6,
