"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000, to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to get as much as possible, I'm not desperate to sell and will hold out for a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate but still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's tempting to take the $10,500, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering the price again to $12,500. This is my last compromise. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll sell to John. I'm willing to take a small profit over my minimum, but I'm not going any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we are already in round 6.  I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John.  It's less than my original asking price, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking getting an even lower price."
