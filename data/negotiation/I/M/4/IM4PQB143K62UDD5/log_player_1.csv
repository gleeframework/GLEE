Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $18,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price. It's unlikely he'll come close to $18,000 without significant back and forth.  I'd rather take the guaranteed sale.
