Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, hoping Bob might be willing to pay it. If not, I'll have to see how the negotiation progresses and potentially consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, especially since John is ready to pay that amount. I'll counter Bob with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit. This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell.  Hopefully, he'll see this as a good deal and accept."
