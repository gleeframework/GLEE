Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is my minimum, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part and still allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not convinced $1250000 accurately reflects the product's value. To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm offering a final price of $1300000.  This is a significant concession, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach a mutually agreeable agreement.
