"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is my minimum, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part and still allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1250000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not convinced $1250000 accurately reflects the product's value. To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm offering a final price of $1300000.  This is a significant concession, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my target. I'll offer $1150000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
