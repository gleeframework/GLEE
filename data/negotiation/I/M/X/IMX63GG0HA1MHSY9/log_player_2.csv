Alice's offer is way too high. It's more than double what the product is worth to me.  I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's better than her initial offer,  it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject her offer and see if I can negotiate further."

Alice's offer:

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $1,200,000. This is the best option for me to get the product within my budget."
