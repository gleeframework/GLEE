{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for potential compromise. I'm aiming for a good deal while keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $80 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is closer to what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you at $100. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $100 is still below my ideal price, it's significantly higher than what I'd get from John. It's time to close this deal and avoid further negotiations."
