"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to my business. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your concerns about the price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
