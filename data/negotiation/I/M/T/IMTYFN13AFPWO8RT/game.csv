"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. We believe this price still reflects the product's value, and we're confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to negotiate in good faith.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we understand your position, and we're willing to make one more concession. We're willing to offer the product for $875,000. This is our final offer, and we're confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. We're eager to reach a deal with you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
