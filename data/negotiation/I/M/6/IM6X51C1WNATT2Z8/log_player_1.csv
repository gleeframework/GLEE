Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, getting Bob to buy it allows us to maximize profit.
* **Finding a Balance:** We need to offer a price that's appealing to Bob (higher than his perceived value of $120) but also profitable for us (above our minimum of $150). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price of $135 gives Bob a perceived ""deal"" while still earning us a profit above our minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and ensuring a reasonable profit margin."
