Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $170. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Not Too High:** The price is still within a range that Bob might consider, considering he values the product at $80. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $150, so I'm not risking much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have room to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $80. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's midway between my last offer ($170) and Bob's offer ($60). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him ($80) to emphasize that $120 is still a good deal.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always reduce my price slightly further or accept John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good deal, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet halfway at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $90 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for further negotiation:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and his offer indicates he's willing to pay more than $60. This suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** If I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $90 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal considering you value the product at $80.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:**  I'm continuing to compromise by lowering my price from $120 to $100. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to find a solution.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to make the offer more appealing.
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer is much closer to Bob's latest offer, potentially leading to a deal.
* **Keeping John's Offer in Mind:** If Bob still rejects this offer, I can always accept John's offer for $150."
