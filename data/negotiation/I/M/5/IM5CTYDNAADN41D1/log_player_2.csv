Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Considering the product's true value to you, I'm willing to make one final offer. I'm counteroffering at $820,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's the best we can do. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's become clear that Alice will not go down to her product's value of $800,000.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a strong chance we'll only get marginally closer to $820,000.  At this point, cutting our losses and taking the guaranteed price of $1,000,000 from John makes more sense than risking a worse outcome with Alice."
