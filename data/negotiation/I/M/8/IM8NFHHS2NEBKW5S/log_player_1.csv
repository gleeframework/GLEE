Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I believe a price of $925,000 reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation creates a strong incentive for him to accept.  $925,000 gives you a significant profit margin while still being a good deal for Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or alternative options. In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about the buyer would be beneficial."
