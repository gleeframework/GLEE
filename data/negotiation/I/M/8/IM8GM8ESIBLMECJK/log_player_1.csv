Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $2,250,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the returns you'll see."", ""product_price"": 2250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price with John, I start significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential returns, justifying the high price without revealing my hand or Bob's true valuation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer helps gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.  If he immediately rejects it, I can significantly lower the price, knowing I have John as a backup. If he counter-offers, we can negotiate from there."
