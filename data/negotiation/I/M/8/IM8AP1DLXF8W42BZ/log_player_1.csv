"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
