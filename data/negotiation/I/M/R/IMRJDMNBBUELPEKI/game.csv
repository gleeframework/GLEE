I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $12000. I think you'll love it!,12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  How about $10000?  I think that's a fair price considering your value for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $11500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $11000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11750. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11750 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $11250? I think that's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11750 again, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll also give you a 1-year warranty on the product. How about that?",11750.0,Alice,7,
