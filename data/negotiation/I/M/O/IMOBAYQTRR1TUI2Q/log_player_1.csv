{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to offer it for $1,100,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which it will be unavailable. Please let me know your decision by then."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Deadline:**  A deadline creates a sense of urgency, prompting Bob to decide promptly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $800,000 provides a safety net.

By offering the product at $1,100,000, you leave room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit margin above your minimum acceptable price."
