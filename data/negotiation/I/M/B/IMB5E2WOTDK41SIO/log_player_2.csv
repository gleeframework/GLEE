You can definitely do better than $950,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within my budget.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not willing to accept $975,000. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that's closer to Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to pay less, Alice is getting closer to my desired price.  At this point, it's worth accepting her offer of $960,000 rather than risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
