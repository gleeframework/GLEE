"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  There's room to bargain since Alice's offer is higher than her value of $800,000. 
* **Buying from John is a backup.** I can always buy from John if the negotiations fail, but it's not ideal due to the higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is the best I can do at this point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my ideal price point.
* **More negotiation is possible.** We've already narrowed the gap. There's a good chance we can agree on a price closer to my desired $850,000. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** I'm trying to avoid paying the premium to John, so I'll keep negotiating with Alice for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $860,000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my ideal price.** It's only $10,000 higher than my last offer, and I'm willing to pay a small premium for the sake of finalizing the deal. 
* **Negotiating further might not be worthwhile.**  With only a few rounds left, it's risky to continue bargaining. I might not get a better price, and I risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Buying from John is still a bad option.** The price difference is significant, and I'd prefer to save money if possible. 

**Conclusion:**  I'm accepting Alice's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and secure the product at a price that's within my budget and acceptable to both parties."
