"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is the best I can do at this point. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $860,000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",860000.0,Alice,5,
