Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above my minimum ($120). 
* **Create Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase adds a bit of pressure for Bob to decide quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I'm starting high, there might be a small window for Bob to counter-offer, still landing me a better price than John's offer."
