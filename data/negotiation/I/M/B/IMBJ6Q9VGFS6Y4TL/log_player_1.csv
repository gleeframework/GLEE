Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent profit, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, and I believe I can push for a higher price.  I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! $955,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $965,000?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $965000. I'll propose $960000, which is as close as I can get to your last offer. If you're willing to meet me here, I'd be happy to finalize the deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

We are nearing the end of the negotiations, and Bob is clearly showing a strong desire to close the deal.  $960,000 is a good price, exceeding my minimum threshold and representing a reasonable compromise.
