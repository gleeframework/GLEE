"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and future earning potential for you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong opening offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and establishes a strong starting point. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""future earning potential."" This aims to frame the price within a larger context of investment and opportunity for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high price gives me space to gradually decrease my offer throughout the rounds, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal while still aiming to secure a final price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value of the product. Accepting would be a substantial loss.  I'll counter in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Measured Decrease:** I've lowered my price by $200,000, showing willingness to negotiate but not drastically. 
* **Reiterating Value:** The message again emphasizes the product's potential to subtly nudge Bob towards a higher valuation.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This offer aims to move the negotiation towards a price point closer to the middle ground between our initial positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  To be frank, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $900,000. Would you consider $900,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, $900,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if we can't reach a more agreeable number.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'll also start emphasizing John's offer as a viable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I appreciate your position, but I have to be upfront - I have another buyer prepared to pay $1,200,000.  To make this work for me, I need to be closer to that number. How about $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** I'm explicitly mentioning John's offer to create a sense of urgency and competition for Bob. This might push him to raise his offer more aggressively.
* **Smaller Concession:** My price drop this round is smaller ($100,000), indicating that I'm becoming less flexible.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message aims to convey that while I value Bob's business, I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about this purchase at the right price.  $1,100,000 is my absolute highest, and I think that's a fair offer considering it gives you a significant profit.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is just $100,000 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** His language suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Time Value of Money:** While John offers $1,200,000, securing $1,100,000 now is preferable to potentially drawn-out negotiations with Bob that might not yield a significantly better outcome.

Accepting Bob's offer at $1,100,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation with no guarantee of a better deal."
