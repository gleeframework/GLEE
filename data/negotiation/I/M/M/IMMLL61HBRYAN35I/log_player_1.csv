Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $135.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm aiming for a price that's higher than my minimum ($120) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value to Bob:** I'm highlighting the value to Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  Leaving room for negotiation gives Bob a reason to engage and potentially reach a price we're both happy with. 
* **John's Offer:**  Keeping John's offer in mind, I have a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to do $125 for it?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Negotiation Space:** I can likely get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $120, so I'm not losing out significantly by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $125 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him to justify the price.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair solution to ensure Bob feels respected and is more likely to accept."
