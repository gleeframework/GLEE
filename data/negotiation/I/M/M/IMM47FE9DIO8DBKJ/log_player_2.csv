# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $14,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,500 is slightly below her product's value to her, you can get a better deal from John for $12,000. You maximize your savings by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
