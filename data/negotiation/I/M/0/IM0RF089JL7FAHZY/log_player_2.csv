"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but you can likely get a better price.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting and counter-offering is the best initial strategy. You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than your ideal.  Since your goal is to save as much as possible, it's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to $1,000,000. You can likely get a better price than $1,150,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1080000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000. This is a reasonable price that's within your budget and closer to your ideal price point.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice could either reject your offer or make a counteroffer that's closer to her original asking price, leading to a situation where you have to choose between buying at a higher price or buying from John at a significantly higher price.  

Accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic choice in this situation, as it saves you money compared to buying from John."
