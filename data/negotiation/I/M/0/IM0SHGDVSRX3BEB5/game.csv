"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great price for a product that's worth more to you. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference again and go with $11,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",11000.0,Bob,6,
