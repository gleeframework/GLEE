"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
