Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
**Reasoning:** 

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Testing the Waters:**  A significantly higher offer lets you gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  His response will tell you if you need to go lower or if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Psychological Impact:** A high initial price can anchor Bob's perception of the product's value, making a slightly lower price seem more reasonable later.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. You can always go lower, but you can't go higher once you've made your first offer."
