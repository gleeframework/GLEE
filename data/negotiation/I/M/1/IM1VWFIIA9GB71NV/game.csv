"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns and appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
