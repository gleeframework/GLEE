"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share this product with me. After considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. I've given the matter careful consideration and I would like to offer $12,000 for the product. This is still below what I believe its market value to be, but it's as close as I can get to your original asking price while staying within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
