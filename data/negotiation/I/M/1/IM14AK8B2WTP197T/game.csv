"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,600. That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?",8600.0,Alice,5,
