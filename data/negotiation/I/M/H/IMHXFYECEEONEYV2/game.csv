"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm placing on the product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $15000. This allows for a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $13500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value I'm getting from the product.",13500.0,Bob,4,
