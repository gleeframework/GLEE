Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth a lot more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, knowing it's more than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing it as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By offering $12,000, I can potentially accept a counteroffer of $11,000 or $11,500, still exceeding my minimum desired price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer for $15,000, which gives me leverage if Bob is too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my best offer, let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Better Counteroffer:**  I can likely get more than $10,500 from Bob if I counteroffer. 
* **John is a Strong Safety Net:** If I can't get a better deal from Bob, I'm still guaranteed to make $15,000 by selling to John.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250? This still gives you a good deal and leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer in the Middle:** By offering $11,250, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Language:** I'm framing this as a way for both of us to be happy, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Potential Agreement:** This offer still leaves room for potential compromise. I could potentially accept a counteroffer of $11,000 or even $11,100 if Bob insists.
* **John Still an Option:** I'm still keeping John as a backup, giving me the power to walk away if Bob becomes too inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $10,750, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Still Not Enough:** While Bob's offer of $10,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Stalemate:** Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a long and tiring process, with no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **John Provides a Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price and a much quicker transaction.

I'll choose to sell the product to John for $15,000, as it's the best option to maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
