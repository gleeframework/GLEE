Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above Bob's value:** $120 is higher than the $80 Bob is willing to pay, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **Is below your minimum:** $120 is still above your minimum of $150, ensuring you don't sell below your value.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for both of you to find a price that works. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This still leaves some room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:** $105 is above my minimum of $150, ensuring I still get a good price.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** There's still space for us to find a price that works for both of us. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my preferred price point. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This still gives you a good deal, and it's fair to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This is my final offer, and it's a good one because:

* **It's a fair compromise:** $100 is a happy medium between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.
* **It's still above my minimum:** I'm still getting a price above my minimum of $150.
* **It's a clear signal:**  It shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to go any lower. 

Let's see if Bob takes the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has repeatedly refused to meet my minimum price.  While I'm open to negotiation,  I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I get a fair price."
