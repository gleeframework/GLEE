Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth at least $10,000 in the current market, but I'm willing to offer you a special price of $9,500.  This is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizes Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $10,000 offer from John, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,500 by selling to Bob. 
* **Creates Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" and mention of a public listing encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
