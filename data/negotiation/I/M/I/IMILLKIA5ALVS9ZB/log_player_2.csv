"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even cheaper.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer of $75. This is a significant price reduction from Alice's initial offer of $85, but still within the range where I'm likely to save money compared to buying from John for $100. This initial counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** 

Alice's offer of $90 is closer to my maximum price of $100, but I can still try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to my ideal price of $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is willing to go up to $90, I'm going to meet her halfway by offering $80. This is a reasonable compromise and shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $95 is only $5 less than John's price, and there are still 5 rounds left. It's worth continuing to negotiate in hopes of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $85, which is the middle ground between my previous offer of $80 and Alice's current offer of $95. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a price lower than John's. With only 4 rounds left, I need to start narrowing the price gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $100 is the same price as John's offer. With only 3 rounds left, the chances of getting a lower price are slim. It's more efficient and less risky to buy from John at this point."
