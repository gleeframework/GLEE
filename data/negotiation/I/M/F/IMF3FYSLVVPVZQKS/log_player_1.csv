{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It shows good faith:** You're not starting with an outrageous price, making Bob more likely to engage.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is still a good price, we can likely do better. Bob has shown that he's willing to negotiate, and by rejecting his offer, we can try to push for a price closer to our initial offer of $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price of $1,400,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,375,000? I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value this product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a small compromise:**  It's not a drastic change from Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Positions you for success:** It's still higher than your minimum and potentially more appealing than Bob's offer.
* **Keeps the negotiation going:** It shows you're serious about selling to Bob, but also willing to stand your ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's latest offer is close to our minimum and shows he's still interested. It's a good idea to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price. While we could try to push for a bit more, the chance of reaching an agreement isn't guaranteed."
