"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the product's value to me. It also gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful of getting a better price. I want to see if I can push for $9,500 or at least reach a middle ground closer to that point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,400. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to secure a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal that's above my minimum and very close to the price I was aiming for. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high. I could end up with a lower price or even sell to John for $8,000. It's better to secure a good deal now."
