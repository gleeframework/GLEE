"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $16000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
