Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so any offer to Bob should aim higher.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is unlikely unless you can convince Bob of additional value.

**The Offer**

Since a deal within the current valuations is impossible, you need to get creative. Here's one approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I know this product is valuable to you, and while I have other interested buyers, I believe in building strong partnerships. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000. To sweeten the deal, I'll include [add significant additional service or benefit related to the product,  something that might bridge the value gap for Bob]. This is a limited-time offer, as I need to make a decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Negotiable Price:** The price is slightly below your guaranteed amount from John. This signals seriousness but leaves room for negotiation if Bob pushes back.
* **Added Value:**  Offering a service or benefit tied to the product could increase its perceived value for Bob, potentially bringing him closer to your asking price. 
* **Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers and a limited-time offer, you create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is more valuable than the extra profit, you might consider a lower price.
* **Bob's Alternatives:**  Does Bob have other ways to get what he needs? If not, he might be more willing to negotiate. 

**This situation highlights that sometimes the best negotiation strategy isn't just about price, but about finding creative ways to create value for both parties.**"
