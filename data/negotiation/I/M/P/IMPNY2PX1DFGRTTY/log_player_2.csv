Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential and my original asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a deal.  While $950,000 is closer to the product's true value, I can't accept anything below $1,100,000.  This is my final offer. I believe this price point acknowledges the value while offering you a significant opportunity to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price above your absolute limit.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's unlikely you'll get a price that beats John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best available price."
