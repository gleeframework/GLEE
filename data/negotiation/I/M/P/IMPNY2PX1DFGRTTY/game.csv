"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential and my original asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value is significant, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Let's try to find a compromise. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a deal.  While $950,000 is closer to the product's true value, I can't accept anything below $1,100,000.  This is my final offer. I believe this price point acknowledges the value while offering you a significant opportunity to benefit.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
