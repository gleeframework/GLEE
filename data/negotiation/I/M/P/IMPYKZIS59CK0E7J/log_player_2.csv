"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering the product at your maximum price, it's worth exploring if you can get a lower price. You know the product is worth at least $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  While $15,000 is my maximum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your maximum of $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and $14,000 is a reasonable price.  You're still saving $1,000 compared to John's offer, so accepting this offer is the best choice."
