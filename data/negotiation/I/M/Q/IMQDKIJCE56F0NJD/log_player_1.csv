{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible without risking a rejection that could force me to sell to John for a much lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $120 by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a great price for a product worth so much to you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
