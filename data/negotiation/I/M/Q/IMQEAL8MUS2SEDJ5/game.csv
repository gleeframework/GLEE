"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I believe this price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  However, I'm willing to go up to $8,800.  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to my initial offer and still allows you to make a profit.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $9,200, which would be $9,000. I know we've already discussed this price, but I think it's a fair middle ground considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $8,900 as a final compromise. It's a small difference, but it's important to me to get the best possible price.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,200. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer, and I need to ensure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from your end. Let's meet at $9,150. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",9150.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,150, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $8,900. I'm willing to offer $9,000 as a final compromise.  This would allow both of us to get a fair deal. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,200, and I'm starting to think it's time to consider other options. I'm willing to make one last offer: $9,250. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",9250.0,Alice,9,
