"I understand that you're looking to keep your spending within $12000, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I can do $16000, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $14000 is still a bit low for me. I can meet you halfway, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $17000. This is my final offer on the higher end, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,5,
