"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you! I'm offering it at a special price of $150.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value ($120) but not outrageously so. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to consider the offer.  
* **No Pressure:** I don't mention a time limit or the existence of John, as I want to keep the negotiation focused on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $75 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is Necessary:** I have room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that is acceptable to both of us.
* **Selling to John is Premature:**  While $120 is a guaranteed sale, I have 9 more rounds and the opportunity to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you considering my product.  $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to make it work."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using encouraging words like ""great deal"" and ""happy to make it work"" to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I can only go up to $92.50. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for Compromise:** I can still negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Selling to John is Not Necessary:** With several rounds remaining, I have time to explore if a better price is possible with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget in mind. While $92.50 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. Would you be willing to go up to $105? This would allow me to make the deal work while still offering you a great price on this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer is a smaller jump than before, showing flexibility and a desire to meet halfway. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I again mention the product's ""fantastic"" quality to remind Bob of its worth.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using language like ""great price"" to encourage Bob to see the offer as positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, the window for negotiation is closing. 
* **Low Value to Bob:** Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $120.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $120, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer and aligns with my minimum acceptable price.

I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but his offers haven't come close to my minimum value. It's better to secure the guaranteed sale with John to avoid losing money."
