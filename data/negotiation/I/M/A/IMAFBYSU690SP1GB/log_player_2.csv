"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase our premium product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,300,000. Although it's cheaper from Alice, it's still above your desired price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the option open to potentially negotiate further with Alice or buy from John as a last resort."
