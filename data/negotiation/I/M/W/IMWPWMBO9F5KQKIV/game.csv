"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will be very valuable to you.  My asking price is $2000000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2000000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1600000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1750000 for the product. This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit while hopefully making this deal work for you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While $1750000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go, I'm willing to offer $1650000 for the product. This is the absolute highest I can go, and I truly believe this would be a fair deal for both of us.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
