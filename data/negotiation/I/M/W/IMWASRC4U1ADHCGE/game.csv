"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,250? This way we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
