"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $16,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $16,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  There's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $16,000 is far out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is still too high for his budget, and he can get the product from John for $8,000. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
