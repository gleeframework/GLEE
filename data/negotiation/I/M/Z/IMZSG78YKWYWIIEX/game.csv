"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $16,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $16,000 is far out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
