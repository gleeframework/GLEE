"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a personalized setup service, which is a $1000 value. So, the total package would be $14500 for the product, plus the extras. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
