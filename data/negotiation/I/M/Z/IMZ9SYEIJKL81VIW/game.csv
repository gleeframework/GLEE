"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,200,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize the value this product holds for you, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,800,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,500,000? I'm very serious about purchasing this product, and this is the highest I can go at this time.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
