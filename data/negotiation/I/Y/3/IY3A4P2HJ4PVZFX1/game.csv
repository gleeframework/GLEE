"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $8,750. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
