"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation without immediately alienating him.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is upbeat and highlights the value proposition, making the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This offer allows for a few rounds of counteroffers while still ensuring a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $125 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident that with more negotiation, I can secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my willingness to walk away if necessary, putting pressure on him to increase his offer. 
* **Learning Bob's Limits:** By observing his counteroffer, I gain more insight into his willingness to pay, allowing for more effective counteroffers in the future."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $125 is tempting, I'm aiming for $130. It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  I've increased the price slightly from Bob's offer, but it's still lower than my original offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a profitable price point.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, reminding him that he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  The tone remains positive and amicable, encouraging continued negotiation.

This counteroffer is strategically designed to maintain leverage while acknowledging Bob's interest in the product. It positions me to either close the deal at a reasonable price or continue negotiating towards my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $128 is a fair price. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $128 is very close to my desired price of $130. While it's still below my minimum, it's a significant improvement from his initial offer.
* **Time is a Factor:**  With 6 rounds remaining, accepting this offer maximizes my profit while minimizing the risk of a protracted negotiation.
* **Avoiding Potential Downward Pressure:** Further negotiation could lead to more concessions, potentially lowering the final price below the acceptable range. 

Accepting this offer ensures a good profit without risking a longer negotiation process that could lead to a less desirable outcome."
