"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.**  
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price.** 

It's always a good idea to try to negotiate, especially when you know the seller is willing to accept a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Offering a lower price than Alice's initial offer:** This is the first step in negotiating.
* **Staying within your budget:** $13,000 is still within your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Showing you're serious about buying the product:**  By making a counteroffer, you're demonstrating your interest in the product while pushing for a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're interested.
