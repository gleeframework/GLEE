"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is far too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 just isn't enough.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still significantly less than my original price. If you're serious about buying this product, I think this is the best offer you'll get. ",8500.0,Alice,5,
