Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors.  I'm asking for $1,150,000, as that reflects its true worth.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below that creates a sense of urgency and potential ""deal"" for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing for a potential agreement above his $800,000 valuation.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my desired price."
