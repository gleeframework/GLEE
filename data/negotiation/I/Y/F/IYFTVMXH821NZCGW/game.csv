"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $700000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $700000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to offer you $650000 for it.  This is a fair price considering your value of the product and my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $650000 to you. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your budget concerns.",675000.0,Alice,3,
