"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $400000 is simply too low. While I understand your perspective on market value, this product possesses unique qualities that justify a higher price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $700000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",700000.0,Alice,3,
