"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it brings. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for compromise.  This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize initial profit:**  The offer is close to your minimum acceptable value. 
* **Encourage negotiation:** By not starting at your absolute minimum, you allow for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  The offer isn't so high that it makes it impossible to reach an agreement with Bob, but it's also not so low that you'd be better off accepting John's offer right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1000000. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. It's also less than my initial offer, which means I can potentially push for a better price in the next round.  While John's offer is tempting, I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired value with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to $1,150,000 to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate for a quick deal. 
* **Move towards a compromise:**  This counteroffer brings my price closer to Bob's while still being above his initial offer. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  There's still a gap between our offers, which allows for further bargaining in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to stay above $1000000, but I'm still only comfortable going up to $1075000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to meet our needs.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. John's offer is still on the table, providing a safety net. I'm not willing to sell at this price yet, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,087,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm:** I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000 at this point, so I'm offering a compromise that keeps me above that threshold.
* **Appealing to fairness:**  Presenting the offer as a ""split the difference"" approach makes it more appealing to Bob.
* **Moving closer:** This offer is still significantly higher than Bob's last offer but closer to his range, encouraging him to reconsider.

This counteroffer further explores the potential for compromise without drastically lowering my price. It also keeps the option to sell to John open, ensuring I'm not losing out on a much better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1075000. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a reluctance to budge from his offer of $1,075,000. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of him walking away or further lowering his offer is high. John's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly more favorable, and I'm confident I can secure a higher profit with him. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and accept John's offer."
