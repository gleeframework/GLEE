"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it brings. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to $1150000 to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to stay above $1,000,000, but I'm still only comfortable going up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to meet our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1100000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1087500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget but it's still above his maximum of $1,000,000.  Bob has already indicated a willingness to pay $1,075,000, so it makes sense to continue negotiating for a lower price. There's still room to bargain before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,075,000. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
