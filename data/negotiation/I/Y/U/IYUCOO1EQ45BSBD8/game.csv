"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $110? I'm flexible, but I need to make sure I get a good deal too.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $105? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least that much for the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $105, which would be $102.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $102.50, which would be $103.75. I'm not going to go any lower than that, so this is my final offer.",103.75,Alice,7,
