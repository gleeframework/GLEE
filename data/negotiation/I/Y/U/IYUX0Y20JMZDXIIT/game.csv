"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I agree this product has value, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? I believe that's a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a good value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
