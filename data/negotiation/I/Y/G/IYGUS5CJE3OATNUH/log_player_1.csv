Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob.  $100 is too low."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll do $120?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
