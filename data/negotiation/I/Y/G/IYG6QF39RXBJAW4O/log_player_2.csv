"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's always better to negotiate and see if you can get a better price, especially since you have John as a backup option at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Polite but firm:** The message is courteous but clearly states your price limit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning your budget and the product's perceived value, you provide a rationale for your counteroffer.

This approach aims to bring Alice closer to your desired price range while leaving options open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant discount from my original offer and a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, which is a good sign, but $9,500 is still closer to her asking price than yours. You're only $500 away from John's price, so it's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further. There's little risk in one more counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise by suggesting a price exactly halfway between your previous offer ($8,000) and Alice's current offer ($9,500). 
* **Framing as a win-win:**  The language emphasizes fairness and compromise, encouraging Alice to view this offer favorably.
* **Strategic positioning:** This offer keeps you below your maximum budget and John's price while still potentially securing a deal with Alice."
