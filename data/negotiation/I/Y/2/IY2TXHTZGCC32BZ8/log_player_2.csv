At this point, it's a good decision to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  You're down to the last round. If you reject this offer, you risk not reaching a deal with Alice and having to buy from John for $8,000.
* **Minimal Gains:**  Alice is unlikely to move much lower in the final round. You might be able to shave off another $50, but it's not guaranteed.
* **Significant Savings:** You've already negotiated a price $950 lower than John's offer. This is a significant saving. 

It's always tempting to try to get the absolute lowest price, but sometimes accepting a good deal is the smarter move."
