Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I need to aim higher with Bob to maximize profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we could settle on a price higher than $8,000.
* **Justify the Price:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and uses language like ""unique opportunity"" to create a sense of exclusivity and potentially justify the higher price in Bob's mind. 

**Important Considerations:**

*  This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's financial situation or how much he might be willing to pay. 
* If Bob immediately rejects the $12,000 offer, I might need to quickly adjust my strategy and offer a lower price to avoid losing the sale altogether."
