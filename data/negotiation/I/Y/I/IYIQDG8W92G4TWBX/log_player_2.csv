"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good deal for you.  It's below your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and is a good compromise."
