Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable, so I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $120 allows room for negotiation or a potentially higher profit.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes a ""great deal"" and ""valuable"" to make the offer more appealing. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and how much risk you're willing to take, you could offer a different price."
