"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and focuses on the benefits for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1750000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, he's clearly interested in the product. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price in subsequent rounds.  

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer with a price that is still above Bob's offer, but hopefully closer to what I'm willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still reflects the value this product offers.  Let's meet halfway and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a significant compromise from my initial price, showing flexibility.
* **Still above minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Positive framing:**  The message focuses on finding a solution and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Meeting halfway:**  By suggesting ""meeting halfway,"" I'm implying a willingness to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget limitations.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for higher offers:**  While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, there's still room for him to increase his offer.
* **Time to leverage John:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to start considering my other option, which is selling to John for $1,500,000.
* **Risk of running out of time:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk running out of time and having to settle for a lower price. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but I will also start considering my options with John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $950,000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise one more time. Let's meet at $1,100,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal.  If we can agree on this, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

* **Fair offer:**  I'm presenting $1,100,000 as a fair price that benefits both parties. 

**Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John. With only 5 rounds left, I need to ensure I maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1000000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  I truly believe this is a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still below my threshold.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, the urgency is increasing. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's still room for Bob to raise his offer.  
* **John is a strong alternative:**  If I don't see a significant improvement in Bob's offer, I'm ready to sell to John for $1,500,000. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to push him closer to my desired price. However, I'll be prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and see your desire to reach a deal.  However, $1,000,000 simply isn't enough to cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000 as a final compromise. This price recognizes both the value of the product and your budget constraints.  Let's close this deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes closing the deal and making this happen, adding urgency.

**Next Steps:** 
If Bob rejects this offer, I will most likely go with John. This is my last chance to get closer to my desired price before the time runs out."
