{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation if he's interested. It also doesn't immediately trigger a rejection from Bob since it's not too far off from his value. 

I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum of $150, but I'm also open to negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to assess if I want to continue negotiating with him or sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is far too low. It's well below my minimum value of $150.  I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer of $80 but closer to my minimum of $150. I believe this price is fair, but I'm open to continuing negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting closer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, it seems like Bob isn't willing to go higher.  I'd rather sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum price and a better deal for me."
