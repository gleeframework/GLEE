Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, aiming to secure a good profit.  It leaves room for bargaining, considering Bob values the product at $15,000. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's $10,000 offer if the negotiation fails."
