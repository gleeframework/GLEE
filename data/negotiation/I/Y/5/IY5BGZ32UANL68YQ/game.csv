"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, and I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your business. Let's find a way to make this work!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $875,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to offer you the product for $912,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. What do you say?",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, meeting in the middle seems fair. How about we settle at $890,000? That feels like a good compromise to me.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $900,000?  I'm really hoping to close this deal with you, and I think this price is fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,7,
