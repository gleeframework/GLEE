Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal. The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This acknowledges your interest while reflecting the product's true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product to me while also being fair to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still early in the negotiation, and Bob is incrementally increasing his offer. This suggests he's willing to pay more. I'll continue negotiating to aim for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $887,500? This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value and your interest."",
""product_price"": 887500 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between our last two offers. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also holds firm on a price closer to my desired outcome."
