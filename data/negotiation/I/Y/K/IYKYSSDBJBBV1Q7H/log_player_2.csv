"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product.  Given its value, I'm starting the bidding at $1,500,000.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high. Bob has a better option to buy from John for $1,000,000. However, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I believe the product's true value is higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.

While $1,350,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate further.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down even further, or Bob can always buy from John at the lower price."
