Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price. I'm also emphasizing the potential for a good deal for both of us to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can't afford $9,500 for the product. I am willing to pay up to $8,500. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I still can't afford $9,000. I would like to propose $8,750. This is the highest I can go without compromising my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price and I don't want to risk losing this deal. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a reasonable price."
