"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your target price of $800,000. It's in your best interest to negotiate and try to get a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so you have plenty of time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you compared to selling it to John for $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to your target price, it's still too high. Alice is trying to exploit your desire to avoid buying from John.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. You still have 7 rounds left, so there's room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,100,000 is still too much for me.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which is a significant amount above John's offer and represents a substantial savings for you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm not quite ready to accept $950000, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to your target price, you still have time to push for a better deal. You've shown Alice you're serious about getting a good price, and she's willing to compromise. Continuing to negotiate could get you to your goal of $800,000 or very close. Remember, you have 5 rounds left, so you're not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get to a price closer to my budget. I'm prepared to pay $975,000.  This represents a significant savings for you over John's offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm thinking of $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now going back and forth, and her latest offer is still too high.  You've reached a point where you have only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will drop her price to your target range.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John at $800,000. You've gotten close to your goal, but you need to be realistic about the time constraints and Alice's apparent unwillingness to budge further."
