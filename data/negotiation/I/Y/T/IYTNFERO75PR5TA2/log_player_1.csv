``` 

This offer starts with a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation while still allowing for a significant profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer. $950,000 is significantly below her minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While she could sell to John for that amount, there's still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $975,000. Can we meet in the middle from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is getting closer to Alice's minimum, it's still significantly lower than her ideal price.  Rejecting allows for another counteroffer, potentially pushing Bob closer to her desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference on our last offers and go with $1,012,500?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1012500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than Alice's minimum.  While she could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will become unwilling to go higher.  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,200,000, which meets her minimum and provides a more certain outcome."
