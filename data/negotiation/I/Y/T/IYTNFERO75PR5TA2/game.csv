"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $975,000. Can we meet in the middle from there?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference on our last offers and go with $1,012,500?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
