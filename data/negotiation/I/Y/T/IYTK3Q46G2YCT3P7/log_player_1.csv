"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately. However, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation and highlights the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,200,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's a chance I can push him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've lowered my price slightly, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point.  I'm hoping to squeeze out a little more during the remaining rounds of negotiation. I'm still confident that I can get a better price, especially considering John is willing to pay $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering my minimum acceptable price.  This is a final attempt to get Bob to agree. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but no more. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is only willing to go up to $980,000. This is still below my minimum acceptable price. With only four rounds left, it's unlikely I can negotiate a better deal with Bob.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
