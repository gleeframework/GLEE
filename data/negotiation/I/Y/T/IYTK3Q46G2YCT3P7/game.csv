"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,200,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product to both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
