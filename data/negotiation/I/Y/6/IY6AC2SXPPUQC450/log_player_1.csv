Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's below Bob's perceived value of $150 but still leaves me with a profit of $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is still above my minimum, I think I can get closer to my desired price of $140. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counter-offering with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer, and I believe it's a fair price that still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is still above my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can still push for a higher price, and I'm not willing to settle for a much lower profit at this point. I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my previous offer."

I'm counter-offering with $130. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway this time, as I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. This leaves both of us with a decent profit and avoids having to go through further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. Bob's latest offer of $122 is still below my ideal price point, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is going nowhere.  I'd rather guarantee myself a profit of $22 than risk further rounds of negotiation that might end with a lower price."
