"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $110?  That would work much better for me.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise again. I'll sell the product to you for $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,5,
