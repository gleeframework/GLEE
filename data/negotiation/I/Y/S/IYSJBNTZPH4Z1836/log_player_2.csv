Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, but I'm still not convinced that $700,000 is enough. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is not budging enough and it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer."
