"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  Would you consider $13,000?  That would be a great price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on your offer. However, $13,000 is still a little lower than I can go at this point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500.  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to make a deal.  What do you say?",13250.0,Bob,4,
