Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close as possible to Bob's $120 valuation without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I'm aiming high, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price a tad steep. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price closer to his valuation than my minimum ($100) increases the chances of him accepting.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a successful sale."
