,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9250, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
