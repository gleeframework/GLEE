"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $18,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary:** There's room for negotiation, as Alice values the product at $15,000, which leaves a potential range for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Buying from John is always an option:**  Having the option to buy from John at $10,000 provides a safety net, allowing you to take a calculated risk in negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  Starting at your maximum budget sends a clear signal of your price limit and forces Alice to consider a significant drop. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** While $10,000 is your absolute limit, there's potential for Alice to meet you halfway or close to it.
* **Avoiding unnecessary rounds:**  A low opening counteroffer encourages quick negotiation and potentially avoids unnecessary back and forth."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

* **John remains an option:** Having John as a backup gives you confidence to push for a better price from Alice."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only one round left, the chances of Alice accepting a significantly lower offer are slim.
* **Significant price difference:**  $15,500 is still a considerable distance from your $10,000 budget, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap significantly.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Since John's offer is guaranteed, it's the safer and more predictable option.  Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
