# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's a good deal, but Bob can likely get a better price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay under $900000, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product at a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is a significant discount from John's price.  While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price with further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
