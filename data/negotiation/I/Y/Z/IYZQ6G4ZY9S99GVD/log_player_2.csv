"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I understand it might seem expensive, but trust me, it's worth every penny. Considering its worth to you, I propose we set the price at $125. This allows us both to be satisfied with the transaction. If this proposal meets your expectations, please let me know so we can proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $100 for the product. While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above your budget.  You can get the same product from John for $100, making it the more financially advantageous option."
