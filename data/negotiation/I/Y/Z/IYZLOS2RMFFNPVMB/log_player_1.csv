Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). It allows for potential negotiation while still maximizing my profit.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and professional, highlighting the value of the product and leaving room for open discussion. 

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  It sets a high starting point, hoping to get closer to my desired price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  A lower offer than my minimum could signal a lack of flexibility, discouraging Bob from engaging further.
* **Sets a clear expectation:** By stating a specific price, it avoids ambiguity and encourages a clear response from Bob.
* **Maintains a backup option:** The option to sell to John at $1,000,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000.  Given the value to me, that's the highest I can go.  Let me know if you're open to discussing it further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it still falls short. I believe I can potentially get a higher price by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation. 

**Next steps:** I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly above his offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is a fair price, I'm hoping to secure a slightly higher value for this unique product.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my original offer and provides you with a fantastic opportunity.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$850,000:** This counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($800,000). This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's perspective while emphasizing the product's value and the compromise being offered. It also keeps the door open for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Find a middle ground:** By offering a price halfway between our previous offers, I show a willingness to compromise while not completely giving in.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I use a friendly and respectful tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Highlight the value proposition:** I remind Bob of the unique opportunity and the discount offered.
* **Keep the option to sell to John open:** If Bob rejects this offer again, I can either counter-offer again or choose to sell to John, securing a guaranteed $1,000,000."
