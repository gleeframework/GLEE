"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is a fair price, I'm hoping to secure a slightly higher value for this unique product.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my original offer and provides you with a fantastic opportunity.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
