The product is worth $150 to Alice, and she's offering it at $180, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better price."

Alice's offer of $160 is still higher than what the product is worth to me ($120). It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price before buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $155 is still too high for me.  While I could keep negotiating, it's unlikely she'll drop to my target price of $120. It's best to buy from John at this point and avoid further back-and-forth."
