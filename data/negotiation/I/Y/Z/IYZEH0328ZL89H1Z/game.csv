"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - a significant price reduction for you and a solid profit for me. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about we aim for $950,000? I hope this proposal works for you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate further,  $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - how about $975,000? This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. However, I am still working within a specific budget. Would it be possible to consider $960,000 for the product? This would be a reasonable compromise for both parties involved.",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm open to finding common ground, $960,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $965,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to move forward.",965000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach a compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe $962,500 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",962500.0,Bob,6,
