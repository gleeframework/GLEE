"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that fits within my budget.  I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer and hopefully gets us closer to a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still not willing to sell the product at $875,000, but I'm willing to make another concession.

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $925,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $885,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  This feels like a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us.  I hope you'll consider this offer, as I'm confident we can find a win-win solution here.",885000.0,Bob,6,
