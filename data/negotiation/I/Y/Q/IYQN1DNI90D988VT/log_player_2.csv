"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. This means you'll save $20.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  While you'd still get the product, it would cost you more."
