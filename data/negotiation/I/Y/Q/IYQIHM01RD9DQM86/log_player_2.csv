"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price. You have room to lower the price significantly while still saving money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price.  I've looked closely at the product's value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. While it's a slight improvement, I'm still better off negotiating further. There's still room to lower the price closer to my desired range without needing to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe reflects the true value of the product for me. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still not ideal. I'm going to keep negotiating. I believe I can still get a better price. There are a few rounds left, and there's no need to rush into buying from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to reach a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. Let's try $985,000.

I'm confident we can finalize a deal with this price."", ""product_price"": 985000}
