"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price.  I've looked closely at the product's value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe reflects the true value of the product for me. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to reach a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. Let's try $985,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. I'm confident we can finalize a deal with this price.",985000.0,Bob,6,
