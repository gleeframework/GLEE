{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest.  I'll adjust my strategy depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than my minimum, I'm not yet willing to accept it. Bob has shown some interest and willingness to negotiate.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. However, I believe I can secure the product elsewhere for an even lower price. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is pushing the price lower than I'm comfortable with, and I'm not sure I can get a better price with further negotiation. John is a guaranteed sale at $100, which is a good compromise considering my minimum price and Bob's unwillingness to budge."
