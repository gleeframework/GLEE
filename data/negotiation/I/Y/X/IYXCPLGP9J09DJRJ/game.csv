"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000, which still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
