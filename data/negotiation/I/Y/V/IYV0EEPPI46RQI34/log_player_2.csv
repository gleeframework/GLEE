"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to your business.  I'm asking $1,000,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given its potential benefit to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the unique value this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but this is a significant concession on my part. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to push the price down further. Since Alice's new offer was $900,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than that.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000, which would be $850,000. Can we discuss this further?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
