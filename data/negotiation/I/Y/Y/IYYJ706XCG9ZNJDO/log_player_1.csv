"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and enthusiastic message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I highlight the value of the product to me, hoping to subtly imply its worth to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $10,000 is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000, allowing for potential concessions later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I am only able to offer $9500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,500 is a good offer, but not good enough.**  I'm still aiming for a higher price and want to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob.
* **I have 8 rounds left.** There's time for negotiation, so I'm not willing to settle yet.
* **Selling to John is an option, but not the best.**  While $8,000 is guaranteed, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for something a little closer to my asking price. How about $9,750?  I'm confident this product will be a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a smaller drop:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a bit more.  
* **Focus on value:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to see it as a good deal.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:**  Keeping things positive can help Bob feel more open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and would like to offer $9600 for the product. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $9,600 is only $400 away from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Time is running out:** We're already on round 4, and with each round, the risk of Bob walking away increases.
* **Selling to John is a guarantee, but not the best deal:** While selling to John is a safe option, I'm confident that Bob is close to my desired price, and I'm not willing to lose that potential profit.

**Overall, the risk of pushing for more and losing the deal is higher than accepting Bob's offer and getting a good deal.**"
