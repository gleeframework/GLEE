Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to go beyond $8,000 for the product. Would it be possible for us to reach an agreement at this price?

Explanation: Bob is steadfast at his $8,000 offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a better result. Since John offers the same amount, it's time to move on and sell to John."
