Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I believe it will be very valuable to you, even more so than this offer price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""special price"" and potential value to Bob, increasing the chance he might accept even if it's slightly above his perceived worth. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119.  However, this strategy gives you the best chance of exceeding your minimum acceptable price while still having John as a reliable backup buyer."
