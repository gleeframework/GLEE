"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Even though Alice's offer is already good, there's still room for improvement.  By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, Bob can potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and sets the stage for a back-and-forth. This aggressive counteroffer might seem bold, but it's a strategy to potentially secure a more favorable deal later in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, and there's no guarantee that Alice won't come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  A counteroffer of $1,100,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant savings. This move could potentially lead to a successful deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is a significant saving from her initial price and is very close to Bob's last offer.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in small incremental reductions, which might not be worth the time and effort.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's a good time to accept this offer and secure a good price for the product."
