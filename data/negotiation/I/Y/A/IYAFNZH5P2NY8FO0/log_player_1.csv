"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from my minimum price, but still leaves me with a profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to come close to my minimum price, but I also want to keep my options open with John if Bob isn't interested in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still want to get closer to my minimum price. I hope this counteroffer will make Bob more willing to come closer to my preferred price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I want to try to squeeze out a bit more, and see if Bob is willing to go higher. I will reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to offer $10,000. This is a small drop from my last offer but I believe it's the right amount to signal that I'm serious about selling to Bob, while still getting a good price.  This offer is very close to my minimum and I'm hoping that Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, we're getting close to the point where I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is very close to his perceived value of the product ($8,000). There is little room for him to go higher, and at this point, it is unlikely that we will reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, it is in my best interest to sell the product to John for $12,000, which meets my minimum price and ensures a higher profit."
