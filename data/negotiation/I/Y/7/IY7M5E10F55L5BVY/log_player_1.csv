Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives him an incentive to accept the offer.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in the product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I think it's a fair price considering the market value and the price you're willing to sell it for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good price and significantly higher than what John is offering, there's still potential to get closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's unique value and our ongoing negotiation.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

My reasoning for this counteroffer:

* **Moving closer to Bob's perceived value:**  $1,050,000 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  It's still significantly higher than what I'd get from John, giving me leverage.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** This encourages further discussion with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my desired price point and represents a significant gain over what John is offering.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of losing a deal altogether is increasing.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids further uncertainty."
