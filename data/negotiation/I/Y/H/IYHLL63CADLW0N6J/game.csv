"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $750,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I think this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I still think $925,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $890,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of what's being offered.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",860000.0,Bob,6,
