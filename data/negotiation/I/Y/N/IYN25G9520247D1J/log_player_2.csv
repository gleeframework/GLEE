"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, as you know the value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value to both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a lower price. By offering $13,000, Bob is demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential compromise. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's seriousness in finding a deal that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $13,000 is a bit low for me, considering what this product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $13,750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,750 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13,500?  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us and allows us to close the deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still a little hesitant at $13,500. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $13,600. This is really my final offer. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,600
