Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I believe I can get even more by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise, but it still keeps the price closer to my target than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm concerned that further negotiation won't get me a price close to what I want. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $800,000."
