""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $8,750. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a competitive price for its value."", 
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations slightly above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:** While I want to maximize profit, setting the price significantly higher (e.g., $10,000) could deter Bob entirely.  A price of $8,750 is a reasonable markup that might be acceptable to Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer willing to pay $8,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product at my minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Bob's response will determine the next step in the negotiation."
