**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,550,000 and even hinting at walking away. While I could push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a real risk of him walking away entirely. Accepting his offer guarantees a significant profit of $550,000, which is a healthy return. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with John's offer of $1,000,000 or even losing Bob as a buyer."
