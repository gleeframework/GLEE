"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what might work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally wise to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price in a negotiation. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Target in Mind:** My goal is to pay no more than $1,200,000. By starting at $800,000, there's a chance Alice might be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, closer to my target.
* **Alternative Option:**  I always have the option to go with John for $1,200,000, so I don't want to concede too much too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. This product offers unique advantages and a substantial return on investment.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000.  This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's inherent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down significantly, $1,900,000 is still well above my $1,200,000 maximum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her message suggests a willingness to negotiate further. There's a chance she might be willing to go lower.
* **John as Backup:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value while working within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Strategically:**  I increased my offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but kept it significantly below her price.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** This counteroffer aims for a middle ground between her $1,900,000 and my previous $800,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I haven't reached my maximum budget yet, which gives me some room to maneuver if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've considered your offer carefully, and to be completely transparent, $1,500,000 is the lowest I can go. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for you. I believe this final offer represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has stated $1,500,000 is her lowest price. This is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **No More Room to Negotiate:**  Her language (""final offer,"" ""lowest I can go"") suggests she's unlikely to budge further.
* **John is the Better Option:**  I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within my budget. There's no point in trying to negotiate further with Alice when I can get a better deal elsewhere."
