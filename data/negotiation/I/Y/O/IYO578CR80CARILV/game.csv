"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what might work for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. This product offers unique advantages and a substantial return on investment.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000.  This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's inherent value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value while working within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've considered your offer carefully, and to be completely transparent, $1,500,000 is the lowest I can go. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for you. I believe this final offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
