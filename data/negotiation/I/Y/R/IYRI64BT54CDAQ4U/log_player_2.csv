"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price, knowing it's worth considerably more to you. Let's discuss a price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum value ($15,000).** 
* **It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John.** While it's more expensive, it's still within your budget."
