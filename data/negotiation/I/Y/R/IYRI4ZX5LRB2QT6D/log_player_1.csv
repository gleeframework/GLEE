"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, just below my minimum acceptable price. This is a bold move, but it allows for potential negotiation space and sets the tone for my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price and leaves me with less profit.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit. I believe $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's initial offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $11,500 is still too low.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping we can reach a mutually acceptable price. However, I'm also aware that I'm running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still within a range that's acceptable to me. I'm trying to gauge if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'm starting to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds.  While I would have liked to have secured a higher price through negotiation, selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit and removes the risk of continued negotiation."
