"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is truly worth. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I must stick to my budget. I am proposing an offer of $1,500,000.
