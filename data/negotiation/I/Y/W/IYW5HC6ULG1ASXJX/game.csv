"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that $18000 might be a stretch for you. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
