"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Could you meet me halfway at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $12,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
