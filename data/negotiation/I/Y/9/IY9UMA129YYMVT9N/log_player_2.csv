"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer of $900,000.

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still potential to save more.  Bob should continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target price of $850,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me and the initial offer I made.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her original offer of $900,000.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price and within Bob's budget.  While further negotiation is possible, it's likely that Alice will be unwilling to budge further.  Accepting the offer at this point is the most logical choice."
