"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm aiming to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's well above your value and within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer of $900,000.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me and the initial offer I made.",900000.0,Alice,5,
