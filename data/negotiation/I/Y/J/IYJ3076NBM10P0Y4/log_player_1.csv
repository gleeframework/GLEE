Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000. This would give you a good profit and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  $900,000 is still below my target, and I believe I can get closer to my ideal price with some further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still leaves room for you to make a good profit. Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 950000}
