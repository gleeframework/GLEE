"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000? I'm really interested in the product but need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $2,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is a significant step, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. 
* **Focus on budget:**  Highlighting the budget constraint reinforces the need for a lower price.
* **Positive tone:**  Keeping a positive tone maintains a good relationship with Alice, making her more likely to consider the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for it. How about we say $11500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $11,500 is still a bit higher than Bob's target.  Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a lower price, especially as he has 7 rounds left before resorting to John. There's still room for a counteroffer to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11,000?  This would allow me to purchase the product and would still give you a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show appreciation:** Acknowledge Alice's compromise to maintain a positive relationship.
* **Compromise while still pushing:**  Offer a price that's closer to Alice's previous offer, but still lower, demonstrating Bob's willingness to meet halfway while still advocating for his budget. 
* **Highlight the benefit to Alice:**  Emphasize that this price would allow Alice to make a fair profit, potentially increasing her motivation to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not quite ready to go any lower. How about we say $11250? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $11,250 is very close to Bob's target price of $11,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate increases. There's a chance Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying more or having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Good Deal:**  While not ideal, $11,250 is still a good deal for Bob, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and John's price. Accepting ensures a purchase and prevents further risk."
