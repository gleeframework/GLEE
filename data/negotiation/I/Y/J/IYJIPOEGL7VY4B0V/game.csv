"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for it. How about we say $11500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11500 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11000?  This would allow me to purchase the product and would still give you a fair profit.",11000.0,Bob,4,
