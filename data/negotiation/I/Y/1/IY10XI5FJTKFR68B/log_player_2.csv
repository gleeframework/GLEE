"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to acquire this item. My initial offer is $500000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget.  It's a good starting point to negotiate from, and there's a lot of room for me to potentially save money.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $500,000 is a bit low for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. After some internal discussions, I propose to sell the product for $800000. This is a fair compromise between our initial positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully get a lower price. There is still room for me to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
