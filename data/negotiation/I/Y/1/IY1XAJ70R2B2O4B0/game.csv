"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider this price?",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I really appreciate your continued interest. While $10,250 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still need a bit more to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $10,400. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal.",10400.0,Alice,5,
