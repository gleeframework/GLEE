"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully nurtured and believe has the potential to significantly benefit your business.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000. I know this is a valuable asset, and I'm confident that this price reflects its true worth. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's but still above Bob's maximum value.**  Bob is willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is asking for $950,000.  
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** Bob can reject Alice's offer and potentially negotiate a lower price with her or explore other options."
