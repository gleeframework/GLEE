"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a $100 limit. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraint. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 simply wouldn't cover my costs. Would you be willing to go up to $110? This would still be a great deal for you, and I believe you'll find the product well worth it.",110.0,Alice,3,
