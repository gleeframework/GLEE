"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this. However, $1,200,000 is quite a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering its true market value."", ""product_price"": 500000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:**  Starting significantly lower than my actual budget ($800,000) gives me room to negotiate upward while still aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer.
* **Market Value Mention:**  By mentioning ""true market value,"" I'm subtly suggesting that Alice's valuation might be inflated, hoping to create some doubt in her mind.
* **Positive Tone:** Despite the low offer, I maintain a polite and constructive tone to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,000,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair and reasonable, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice moved significantly:** Her willingness to drop to $1,000,000 shows she's open to negotiation.
* **Still room to negotiate:** $1,000,000 is still considerably higher than my target price and John's offer.
* **Strategic counteroffer needed:** I need to make a counteroffer that encourages further negotiation without being too low and risking offense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,000,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $650,000?  I'm serious about purchasing the product, and I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:**  Increasing my offer by $150,000 shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate seriously and move towards her price point.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating my budget limitations without being overly aggressive.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts me within a reasonable range of both Alice's offer and my maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Serious Buyer:** I want to reinforce that I'm genuinely interested and aiming for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $650,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $900,000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's limit:** Alice has explicitly stated that $900,000 is her final offer.
* **Minimal potential savings:**  Even if I can negotiate Alice down slightly, it's unlikely to be a significant amount below $900,000.
* **Guaranteed savings with John:** Buying from John guarantees a price of $800,000, saving me at least $100,000 compared to Alice's best offer.

At this point, the risk of further negotiation with Alice outweighs the potential for relatively small savings. John offers a secure and immediately favorable alternative."
