Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,750,000. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum desired value.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd love to push for a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is still above my minimum desired value of $1,500,000. It's a good deal for me, and it's worth accepting rather than risking further negotiation or settling for John's offer."
