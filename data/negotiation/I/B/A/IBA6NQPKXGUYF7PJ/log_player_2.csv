Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if we can get a better deal.  We'll start by rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $825,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in her price, and we're close to finding a mutually agreeable solution.  While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting $825,000 is still a good deal compared to the $1,200,000 I'd pay to John."
