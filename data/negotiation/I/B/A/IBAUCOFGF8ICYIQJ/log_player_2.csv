# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm asking for $1000000. I believe it has the potential to be equally valuable for you, and I'm open to discussing your perspective. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."
