Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows me to potentially gain a significant profit beyond my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob counters my offer, there's space to negotiate downwards and still secure a better price than John's guaranteed offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product at my minimum price provides a safety net. This allows me to confidently aim higher with Bob."
