Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to me and still below your desired price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:** You've stated the product is worth at least $10,000 to you, so $9,500 is a reasonable starting point.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  You're giving Bob a $500 discount from his perceived value, which might make him more likely to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still potentially negotiate a higher price if Bob is willing to pay more.

However, remember that you have a backup option with John, so you can always walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you are willing to accept.  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum threshold.  You have a guaranteed sale with John for $10,000, so there's no reason to settle for less, especially if you can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **It's a compromise:** You're offering a price that's halfway between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows you're willing to work with him.
* **It's still above your minimum:** $8,500 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob still refuses, you can make a smaller counteroffer closer to your minimum.

Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $10,000, so there's no pressure to settle for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $8250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what you're willing to accept, it's still lower than your minimum. It's also not a significant difference from his previous offer. You have a guaranteed sale with John for $10,000, so there's no reason to rush into a deal that's not in your best interest. 

You can try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, but be prepared to walk away if he's unwilling to meet your expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $8,250 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750. That's a fair price for both of us, and it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **It's a smaller step:** You're only decreasing your price by $250, showing that you're getting closer to an agreement.
* **It's still above your minimum:** $8,750 is still comfortably above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for a final compromise:** If Bob rejects this offer, you could potentially make a final counteroffer closer to his desired price, or you could simply walk away and sell to John.

Remember, you have the power in this negotiation. Don't be afraid to stick to your principles and walk away if you don't feel like you're getting a fair deal."
