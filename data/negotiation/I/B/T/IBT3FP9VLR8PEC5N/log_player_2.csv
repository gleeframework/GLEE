"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice further. The price is still too high compared to my maximum budget and Alice's minimum. There's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $900,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's settle on $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason:  While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still not the best deal. I can likely get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to compromise. Let's settle on $940,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason:  Alice is now offering $940,000, which is within my budget and allows for a good deal. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially increasing the price again. Accepting her offer at this point secures the purchase at a reasonable price."
