Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've thought about it and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $100. What do you think?

You have three options:

While $100 is Alice's value, I can still try to get it for a bit less before going with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the way you think, Bob! $95 is a bit better than I was thinking, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $98, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98

This is a good deal!  It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and $98 is a significant savings compared to John's $120 price."
