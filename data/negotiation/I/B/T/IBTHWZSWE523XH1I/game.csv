"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a generous offer, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
