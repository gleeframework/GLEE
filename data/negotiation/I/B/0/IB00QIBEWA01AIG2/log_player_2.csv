Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $200 is already a very competitive price for this product. I could meet you halfway at $150, which is the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer willing to pay $150 for the product.  I'm invested in seeing you get a good deal though.  How about we split the difference and land at $132.5? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $150 mark and even using a bit of salesmanship by mentioning another buyer.  While she might come down slightly, it's unlikely she'll go below $130, especially with a supposed other buyer. At this point, cutting losses and buying from John for $100 ensures the best possible price and avoids further negotiation."
