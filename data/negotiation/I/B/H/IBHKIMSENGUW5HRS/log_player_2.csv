"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120. Alice is offering $110, which is a decent price, but you can potentially do better. By rejecting, you open the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $100 is the product's value to Alice, you can try to meet her halfway.  Offering $105 gives you a good chance of reaching a compromise while still saving $5."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer to $115.  While this is still more than your initial counteroffer of $105, it's a better price than John's offer of $120. Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product while still saving some money."
