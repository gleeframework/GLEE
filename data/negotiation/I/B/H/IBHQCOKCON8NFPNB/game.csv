"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $8,000 is just below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $9,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to go.",8500.0,Bob,4,
