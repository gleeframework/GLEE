"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $150 to you. For this round, I'm proposing a price of $130 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $150.** You want to save as much money as possible.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.**  There's time to try to get a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.** This ensures you won't be left without the product. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can start the negotiation process and hopefully lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about saving money. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $115 is still above Alice's minimum of $100, indicating you're open to compromise. 
* **Sets the stage for future rounds:** If Alice rejects, you can continue to adjust your offer based on her responses, keeping in mind your $150 ceiling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a more suitable price for both of us. For this round, I am offering the product for $120. I believe this price reflects the value you place on the product while allowing for a fair transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your target price range.**  $120 is below your maximum of $150, meaning you'll save money compared to buying from John.
* **You've already made a counteroffer.** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **There's still time to negotiate further.**  While you might be able to get a slightly lower price, accepting Alice's offer now secures the product for a good price, and you can avoid the risk of the negotiation falling apart completely.  

In this case, accepting Alice's offer represents a good balance between saving money and ensuring a successful transaction."
