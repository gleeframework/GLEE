"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to your operations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, given the product's unique value and potential. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's always worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to secure this product at a slightly lower price point. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This reflects a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $1000000 doesn't quite meet my expectations for this unique product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still reflects the value I believe this product offers, but it also demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant decrease from her initial offer and closer to your desired price point.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further or you could end up spending more time negotiating without a guarantee of a better price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation or having to buy from John at a higher price."
