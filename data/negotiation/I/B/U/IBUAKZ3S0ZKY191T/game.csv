"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but based on my needs and budget, I am unable to agree to $18000. Could we possibly negotiate closer to the value I place on the product, which is $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $16000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000.",16000.0,Alice,3,,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to meet at $16000. I would like to propose a price of $12000, as I believe this brings us closer to a fair compromise between our respective values.",12000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I can see you're willing to make a serious effort to reach a deal. I appreciate your proposal of $12000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $16000, which is $14000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can seal the deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,,
