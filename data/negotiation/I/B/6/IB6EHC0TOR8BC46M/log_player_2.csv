"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $150.
* Alice's offer is $120, which is a good deal, but you can likely get a better price.
* It's worth negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much as possible.
* Your initial counteroffer of $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* This offer shows Alice you're serious about buying the product, but are willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $115, which is closer to your target price of $80.
* Continuing to negotiate might save you a few more dollars, but the risk is that Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying $150 to John.
* At $115, the potential savings from further negotiation aren't worth the risk of losing the deal."
