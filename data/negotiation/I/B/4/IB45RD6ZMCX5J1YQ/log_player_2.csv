"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure an item valued at $15,000 for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. I'm glad we're able to discuss pricing. Based on our current negotiation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,500 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between the value you see in it and the price I need to cover my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and still allows Bob to save $500. It's a reasonable compromise that benefits both parties. There's no need to continue negotiating as it's unlikely Bob can get a significantly better price from Alice."
