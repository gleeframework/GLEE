Round 3

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the idea of meeting in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to offer it to you for $155. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $155.  It's better to buy from John at $150 and save the extra $5.  There's no guarantee Alice will go lower in future rounds."
