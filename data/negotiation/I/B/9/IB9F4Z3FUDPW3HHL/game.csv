"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,100,000 again? I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my initial offer. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
