{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $11,000 is still too high, and we have 10 rounds to try and get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm starting with a significant offer, but still below my maximum price. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price doesn't come down."

Alice has come down a bit, but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident I can get a better price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise. This also allows for some wiggle room in case she counters again."

Alice is still offering too high. I'm willing to keep trying to get a better price, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but just slightly.  I'm trying to get closer to Alice's desired price point while still staying within my budget. It's a calculated risk, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now closer to my budget, and we only have a few rounds left. It's a good deal, considering the alternative is buying from John for $8,000.  I'm confident I can't get much lower than this."
