Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while also giving me a good starting point for potential counteroffers."

We're getting close to the end, so I'll be watching closely how Bob responds.  If he doesn't get closer to my desired price, I'll be ready to sell to John."
