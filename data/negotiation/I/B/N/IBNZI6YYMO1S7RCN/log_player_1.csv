Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we discuss a price of $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, even if it takes a few more rounds."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but based on my budget and the current market situation, I am unable to go beyond $1,500,000. This is the maximum amount I am willing to spend on this product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these figures? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. It's better to close the deal now than risk him lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
