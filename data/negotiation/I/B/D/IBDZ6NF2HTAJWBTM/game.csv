"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1200000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to pay $900000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $900000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1200000, which would be $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950000,  which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, which is $50000 above your latest offer. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
