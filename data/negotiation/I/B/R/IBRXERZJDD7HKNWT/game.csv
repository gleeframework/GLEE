"I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable paying $11,500. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see that we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $12,750. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,750 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find common ground.  I'm willing to pay $12,250.  Let's make this happen.",12250.0,Bob,6,
