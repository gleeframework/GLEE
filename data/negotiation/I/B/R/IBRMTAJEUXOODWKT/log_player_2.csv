"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very competitive price.  Let's say $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm still making a profit and you're getting a great product at a lower price than you'd find elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
