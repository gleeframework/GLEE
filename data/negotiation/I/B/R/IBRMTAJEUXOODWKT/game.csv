"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very competitive price.  Let's say $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm still making a profit and you're getting a great product at a lower price than you'd find elsewhere. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
