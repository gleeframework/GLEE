,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, I'm looking to get a bit closer to $85 for the product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $82.50?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $82.50, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $78? I really want to make this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to drop the price a bit more, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $80? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
