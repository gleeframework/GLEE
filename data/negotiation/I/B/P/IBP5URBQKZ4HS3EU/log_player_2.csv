"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $12,000 is significantly above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000), and you have a clear upper limit of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  There's room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **No immediate risk:** Rejecting doesn't commit you to buying from Alice; you can always switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  My counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to establish a reasonable negotiation range.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $9,500 is still above the product's worth to Alice, giving her incentive to negotiate.
* **Strategic pricing:** This price allows for potential negotiation while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While lower than her initial offer, $11,500 is still above my ideal price range and leaves limited room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining negotiating power:**  Rejecting the offer demonstrates that I'm committed to getting a better deal and prevents Alice from assuming I'm desperate.
* **Time on my side:**  I have 7 rounds left, so there's time to explore further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Middle ground:**  $10,500 is a potential middle ground between our previous offers, making it a more attractive option for Alice. 
* **Keeping the pressure on:**  By making another counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm still interested but won't settle for an unreasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $11,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000) and leaves little room for further negotiation.
* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the rounds, and I need to find a more favorable price soon.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still a chance Alice might lower her price further, especially with my previous counteroffers.

**Next steps:**  I'll need to strategically choose my next counteroffer to push Alice towards a more acceptable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly again, but not by as much as before. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a strong position.
* **Testing the waters:** $10,750 is close to Alice's last offer, making it a potential point of agreement.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by increasing my offer. If Alice accepts, I'll secure a good deal. If she rejects, I'll have one more round to try again.
* **Time pressure:**  We're approaching the end of the negotiation, so I need to make progress quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting close:** $10,800 is only slightly higher than my last counteroffer.
* **Time is running out:** With only three rounds left, I need to secure a deal soon to avoid buying from John at a much higher price.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** There's little room for further negotiation, and I risk losing the opportunity to get a deal with Alice altogether.

**Conclusion:** While I prefer a lower price, it's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonably good price than risk losing the opportunity and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
