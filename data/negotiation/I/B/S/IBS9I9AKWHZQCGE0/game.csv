"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This leaves us both with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",920000.0,Bob,4,
