Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's  above my minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also open to a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly better price from him. It's better to accept his offer and get a guaranteed $9,500 than to risk a prolonged negotiation that might result in selling to John for $8,000."
