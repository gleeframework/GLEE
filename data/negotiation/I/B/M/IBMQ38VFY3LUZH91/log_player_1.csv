Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information you've provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential, and I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's value leaves room for him to potentially negotiate up, increasing your profit.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message positions the price as fair, highlighting the value to Bob, while still being firm.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While we have John as a backup, getting closer to Bob's valuation is ideal for maximizing profit. 

**Important Notes:**

* This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or any urgency on his part. 
* Real-world negotiations involve more factors like relationships, market conditions, and alternative options for both parties."
