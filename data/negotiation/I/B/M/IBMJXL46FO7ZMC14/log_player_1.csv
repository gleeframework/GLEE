Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than my minimum, I think I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're looking for a good deal.  How about $95?  I'm confident you'll love this product and I'm willing to come down a bit more to make this work."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```
I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise, showing I'm flexible but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $85? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Ok, Bob's offer of $85 is just above my minimum of $80.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm going to accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely.  It's a decent price, and I don't want to risk John buying it for $80."
