Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a good price for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $115. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While $115 is closer to my budget, I know I can get the product for $100 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when I have a guaranteed better deal elsewhere."
