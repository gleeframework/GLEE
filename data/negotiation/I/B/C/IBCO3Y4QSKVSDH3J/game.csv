"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? This would give us both a good deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
