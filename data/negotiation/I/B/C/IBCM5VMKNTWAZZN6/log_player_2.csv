"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my original asking price to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to my maximum budget of $1,000,000, but it's still within a reasonable range.  Since I can get the product for a bit more than my budget, it's likely worth it to avoid further negotiation and secure the product.  Rejecting this offer could lead to another counteroffer from Alice that might be even higher."
