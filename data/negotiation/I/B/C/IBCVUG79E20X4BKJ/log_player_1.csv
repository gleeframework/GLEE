I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, giving us both the opportunity to reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm countering with $13,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 less than my previous counteroffer. I'm willing to accept this, as it's still significantly better than selling to John for $10,000."
