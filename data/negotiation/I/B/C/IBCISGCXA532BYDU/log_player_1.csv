I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,000,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price.  I will counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up with a more acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm not averse to negotiating, I'm not confident I'll be able to get a better price from him. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that is acceptable."
