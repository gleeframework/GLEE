Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** Giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum:** Leaving you with profit and flexibility. 

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, you create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept.  It's also a good strategy to keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  I believe I can get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,060,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is getting close to my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's not worth risking the sale. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoid potential delays with further negotiation."
