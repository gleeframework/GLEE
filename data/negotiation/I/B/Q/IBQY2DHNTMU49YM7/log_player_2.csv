Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80, Bob. That's below my minimum price. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it.

Explanation:

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $97.50.  It's unlikely she'll change her mind and your goal is to get the product for $80 or less. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
