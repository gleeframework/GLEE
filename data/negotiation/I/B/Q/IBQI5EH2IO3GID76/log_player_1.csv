Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob might counter. This allows room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting a higher price.  If Bob counters with something lower than $800,000, I'll use John as leverage to encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my desired $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while still remaining within a reasonable price range for me. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred a higher price, $1,050,000 is significantly better than selling to John for $800,000.  It's a good compromise and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
