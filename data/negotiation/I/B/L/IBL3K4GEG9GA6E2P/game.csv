,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $157.50?",157.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $157.50 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $165. This is a fair price, considering its value.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $155, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",155.0,Bob,4,
