Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $157.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $157.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $157.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I can get a better price from John. However, I'm not going to sell to John yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $157.50 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $165. This is a fair price, considering its value."", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $155, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $155. It's a good price, and it's getting close to my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and then having to sell to John for $150."
