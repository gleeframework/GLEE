I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum of $1,500,000 as possible without risking losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still trying to get as close to my minimum as possible. This should incentivize Bob to accept, as he's already expressed interest at $1,400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer, even though it's getting closer to my minimum. I want to see if I can get him to go a little higher. I'm confident I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."

I'm making a small concession, meeting Bob halfway on his last offer. This is a strong counteroffer that shows I'm serious about selling to him, while still being within a range that's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's counteroffer is only $25,000 away from my minimum. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal. John is offering a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is my minimum."
