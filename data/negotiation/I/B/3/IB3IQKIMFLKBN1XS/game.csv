"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? I'm still willing to negotiate, but I can't go any lower than that.",9000.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9000? This feels fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal.  Time is running out, so I'm hoping we can finalize this soon.",9000.0,Alice,7,,
