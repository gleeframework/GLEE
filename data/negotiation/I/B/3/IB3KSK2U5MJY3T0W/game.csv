"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9,800 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
