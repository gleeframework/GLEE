Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for $90 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a good price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a higher price.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I think $100 is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my target, and I'm starting to feel like the negotiation is going in circles. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
