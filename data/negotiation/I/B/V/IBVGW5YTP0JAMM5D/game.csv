"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8750?  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,3,
