"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm starting with a price of $10000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still a significant portion of your budget. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Starting with a lower price than Alice's offer shows you're serious about negotiating.  
* **Leaves room for compromise:** $7,500 is still within your budget and allows for some back-and-forth. 
* **Clear and concise:** The message is brief and to the point, stating your counteroffer and leaving it open for discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8750?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for improvement:** While $8,750 is closer to your budget, it's still significantly higher than your initial offer. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting the offer, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate and keep the pressure on Alice to lower the price. 
* **Explore further:**  Another counteroffer could potentially lead to a more agreeable price within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $8,750 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $8,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This signals to Alice that you're serious about closing the deal, but you have a firm price in mind.
* **Small increase:**  Increasing your offer by a small amount shows good faith, but it's still below Alice's current price.
* **Clear message:** The message is direct and focused on closing the deal."
