I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While I'd like to accommodate your budget, I'm unable to accept the proposed offer of $900,000. I am willing to negotiate further, so I propose a revised price of $1,050,000. This still offers a substantial discount compared to the product's true value, while allowing us to come closer to a mutually agreeable solution. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price that seems like a steal. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've considered your proposal and am willing to meet you halfway towards a fair compromise. I propose a revised price of $1,025,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to its true value, while addressing your concerns about the budget. I hope this proposal allows us to move forward towards a successful transaction.

It's getting close to a point where further haggling might not yield much more. Accepting at $1,025,000 secures a good deal for Bob, saving him a substantial amount compared to John's offer."
