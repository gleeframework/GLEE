Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $15,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
