"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $15,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $12,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
