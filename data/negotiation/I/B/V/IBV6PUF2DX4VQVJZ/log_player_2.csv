# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

I still think $1,200,000 is too high, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll make another counteroffer.
