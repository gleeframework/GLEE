**Reasoning:** 

While it's tempting to push for more, Bob has been firm at $1,075,000 and is now threatening to walk. Accepting this offer still gives a significant profit over John's offer of $800,000. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely and potentially getting stuck with the lower offer."
