Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing, and I appreciate your willingness to make a commitment. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price reflects the product's unique benefits and the value it will bring to your business.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.
