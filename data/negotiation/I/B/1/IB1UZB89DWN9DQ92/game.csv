"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing, and I appreciate your willingness to make a commitment. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price reflects the product's unique benefits and the value it will bring to your business.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,550,000. This price is closer to what I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
