I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a fair price that is above my minimum threshold and leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price will be attractive to Bob, who values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I will reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,250. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows me to earn a significant profit. I'm confident that Bob will find this price acceptable and agree to purchase the product."
