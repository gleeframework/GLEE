"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,200,000 is well above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,000,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is my best offer, but I'm open to a compromise.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering $950,000. This is my best compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
