Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $110 is higher than Bob's valuation of $80, giving you some room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $110 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's a good middle ground that allows for potential negotiation.

By offering this price, you're setting the stage for a potential negotiation while also ensuring you don't lose out on a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is higher than his initial valuation of $80, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  

By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Maintain your position:** You signal that you're not willing to sell below your minimum.
* **Potentially get a better price:**  By making a counteroffer, you might push Bob closer to your desired price. 
* **Maintain the negotiation:** It keeps the dialogue open and allows for potential compromise.

**Next Step:** You should make a counteroffer to Bob. It should be slightly lower than your initial offer but still above your minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above your minimum.
* **Fairness:**  The offer is close to the middle ground between your initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90, making it seem like a fair compromise.
* **Maintain leverage:**  You're still above your minimum, so you haven't lost much leverage in the negotiation.

This counteroffer is a strategic move to maintain the negotiation while still ensuring a profitable sale for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved up slightly from $90 to $92, it's still significantly below your minimum of $120.  Selling to John for $120 would be a much more profitable option at this point. 

However, there's still potential for Bob to increase his offer.  By rejecting this offer, you can:

* **Maintain your position:** You continue to show that you won't settle for a price significantly below your minimum.
* **Encourage further negotiation:** By rejecting his offer, you're pushing Bob to consider a higher price if he truly wants the product. 
* **Keep the option open:** It keeps the negotiation going, giving you a chance to potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Step:** Make a counteroffer to Bob. You can make it slightly higher than his offer to encourage him to close the gap, but keep it above your minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $98. This should be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer is a significant move towards Bob's offer, signaling that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $98 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you don't lose money on the deal.
* **Encouraging closure:** This offer puts pressure on Bob to either accept or make a final counteroffer.

By making this counteroffer, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable position. The pressure is now on Bob to make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your initial asking price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to your initial price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  At this point, you have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum. 

Selling to John would ensure you get your desired price and avoid further negotiation with Bob, which might lead to more time wasted and potentially lower profit."
