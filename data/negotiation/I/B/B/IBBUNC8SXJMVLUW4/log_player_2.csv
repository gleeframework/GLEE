"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $11,500. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a valuable item, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than her product valuation, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can save $1,500 by going with John's offer of $10,000."
