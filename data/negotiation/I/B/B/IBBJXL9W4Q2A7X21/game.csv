"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $20,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is significantly below its value. Could we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a little steep for me.  How about $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $12,000 is really pushing the lower limit for me.  Would you be willing to do $14,000? That's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
