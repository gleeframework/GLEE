"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, which is above the product's value to me ($150) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not asking for the full $120 difference between our values, as that could be too aggressive and cause Bob to reject immediately.  

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find the highest price I can get while still making a profit. I'm starting high and will adjust based on Bob's response. I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to keep my expenses within $120. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is willing to negotiate, and I can potentially get a higher price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed profit, but there's a chance I can get more by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's not profitable for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price while still being within a range that Bob might consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget.  While I can't go as low as $120, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This still allows me to make a fair profit, and it's a price I think we can both be happy with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $175 to $140, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring a profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This counteroffer is more likely to be accepted by Bob, while still allowing me to earn a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired $150 profit.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and there's still room for a higher counteroffer from me.
* **Opportunity cost:** While selling to John guarantees $150, there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm going to make a final counteroffer in the next round that's close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a great deal for both of us, and it ensures I can make a fair profit. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:**  This is my last counteroffer, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($140) and Bob's current offer ($130).
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and framing this as a win-win scenario for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a compromise that hopefully leads to a successful deal. I'm trying to get as close as possible to my desired profit while still being within a range that Bob might find acceptable. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $150 to guarantee a profit."
