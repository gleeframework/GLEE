"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $10,000. I believe it offers exceptional value, but I'm open to discussing the price further. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $7,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $9,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $7,500 is pushing my limit.  I could accept $8,500, my final offer.  This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to pay $8,250 for the product. That's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that?",8250.0,Bob,6,
