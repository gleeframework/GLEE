"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant and goes well beyond $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,000,000? I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
