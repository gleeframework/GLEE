**Reasoning:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is significantly higher than the maximum I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to my maximum of $120, but I'm willing to be flexible and see how Alice responds."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show some willingness to compromise.  $115 is still lower than Alice's latest offer, but it's closer to my maximum budget.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that Alice will accept."
