"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product at a price significantly lower than what it's worth to you, while I still get a good return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

**Explanation:**

You can get the product from John for $1,000,000.  Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a better deal for Alice, but not for you. It's better to reject her offer and go with John."
