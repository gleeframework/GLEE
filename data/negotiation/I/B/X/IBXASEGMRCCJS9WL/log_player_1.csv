Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range that might be acceptable. If he rejects it, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still holding out for a significant profit.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
