"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He is trying to save as much money as possible and $12,000 is more than he wants to spend.  A counteroffer is the next logical step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still above his maximum price point. He can get a better deal from John and avoid further negotiation."
