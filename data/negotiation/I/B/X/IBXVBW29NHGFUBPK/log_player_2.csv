"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still above your ideal price. There's room for negotiation, and you should aim to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to propose a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get the price down to $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that you are serious about getting a good deal and are willing to negotiate.  It's likely Alice will counter back, but it sets the stage for a more favorable price for you in the long run."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still above my target price. I want to try and get closer to my $1,000,000 target.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a slightly higher price than my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm to my goal of getting a price below $1,050,000.  This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating but also open to meeting halfway. It might encourage her to accept a price closer to my target in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is now very close to my target price of $1,000,000. While I would ideally want a lower price, I've made a significant amount of progress in the negotiation. Continuing to reject offers might risk Alice becoming less flexible or even ending the negotiation. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product for a price that is significantly less than what I would have paid initially or what I would pay to John."
