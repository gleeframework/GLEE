"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this exceptional opportunity to you. The product I have to offer is truly unique and valuable, with an intrinsic worth of $10,000 to me. Given its significance and the benefits it can bring to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its value and your needs. Considering its worth to you is $8,000, I suggest we aim for a compromise that respects the product's true value while being agreeable to you. Let's explore a price around $9,500. I believe this can be a win-win situation for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal.
