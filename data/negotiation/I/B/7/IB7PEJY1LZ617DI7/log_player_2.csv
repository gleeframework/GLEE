"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $15,000 is your maximum, it's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting the initial offer and attempting to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significant discount of $5,000 shows Alice you're serious about negotiating.  This price is likely lower than Alice's desired selling price, but it gives room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down a bit, but it's still a good opportunity to try and get a lower price.  Since we have several rounds remaining, it's worth attempting to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're making a smaller increment this time, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price.  $12,000 is a good middle ground and likely closer to Alice's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  We've reached a point where the price is close to our maximum.  At $13,000, we're saving $2,000 compared to John's offer.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get a significantly lower price. It's better to lock in the deal now and avoid the risk of losing the product altogether."
