Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not quite there. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product you want. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's latest counteroffer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her previous offers and closer to my desired price point. While I would still prefer a lower price, it's a good deal considering the alternative is paying $1,000,000 to John."
