{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, making it more likely he'll engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  It's a fair price given your value for the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired price point. I'll reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
