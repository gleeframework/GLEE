Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.
