Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly downward. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives you a strong position.  You're not desperate to sell below your minimum.

This strategy aims to secure a high price while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
