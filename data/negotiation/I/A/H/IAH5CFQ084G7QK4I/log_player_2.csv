"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's well below its market value. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you have John as a backup option to buy the product for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with her, knowing you have a safety net with John."
