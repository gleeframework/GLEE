"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000, a price that I think reflects its true value. If you're interested, let me know, and we can discuss the details. If not, I have another interested buyer waiting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000**, which is still more than the product is worth to you ($1,500,000). 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John for $1,500,000.** This is more than Alice's price, but still within your budget.
* **The goal is to save as much money as possible.** While rejecting Alice's offer doesn't get you the absolute lowest price, it saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
