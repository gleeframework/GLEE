Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product description] and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than your minimum value of $100.
* **It's not too high:** You don't want to scare Bob off immediately with an outrageous price. 
* **It includes a message:** This helps build a rapport with Bob and makes the negotiation feel more personal. 

Now, let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Would it be possible to lower the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is above your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing you to potentially get a better price.  By sending a counteroffer, you can demonstrate your commitment to the deal while also trying to get closer to your desired price."

```"

You have three options:
