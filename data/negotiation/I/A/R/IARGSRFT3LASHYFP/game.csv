"Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with this opportunity to purchase our product. Given its potential value, I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and benefits.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal considering the product's true value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so I'm offering $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we are getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $975,000 is still too low. How about we split the difference between your offer and my previous price? I propose $1,012,500. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while ensuring a fair deal for both parties.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,006,250 for the product. I believe this price is fair and reasonable considering the product's value and my budget.",1006250.0,Bob,6,
