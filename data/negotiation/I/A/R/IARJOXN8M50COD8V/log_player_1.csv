"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

My strategy here is to start high but still leave room for negotiation that would benefit both sides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Could we work with a price closer to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the substantial benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

Here's my rationale:

* **Rejection of Low Offer:** Bob's initial offer was significantly below my minimum. By firmly rejecting it, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Strategic Counter:** I've reduced my price, but not drastically. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value proposition to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering my absolute minimum price. While there's still potential to earn more, it's getting riskier. Accepting ensures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
