"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but my budget allows me to only pay up to $850000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets within your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to accept $850000, as I believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, I'm still unable to meet the price of $900000. I would like to propose a price of $875000. I hope this offers a compromise that suits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to accept $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $885000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product.",885000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while I appreciate your flexibility, I must respectfully decline at this time. I am still unable to meet the price of $885000. I would like to propose a final offer of $870000. I hope this offer is acceptable, and I look forward to your response.",870000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you've made a serious attempt to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to accept $870000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one last offer: I'll sell the product to you for $890000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",890000.0,Alice,7,
