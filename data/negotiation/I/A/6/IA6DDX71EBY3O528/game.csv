"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still a bit too far from my desired price point. Let's aim for a more equitable solution. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000, meeting you halfway from our last offers. This ensures both of us get a fair deal and allows us to move forward.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'd like to try to get it even lower. How about $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $9,900? This price acknowledges your desire for a lower price while still respecting the value of this product. What do you say?",9900.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to sell at that price, I'm ready to make a deal.",9750.0,Bob,8,
