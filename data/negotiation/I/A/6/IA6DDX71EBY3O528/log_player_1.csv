"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives me some room to negotiate down while still getting a decent price.
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to Bob to emphasize the potential benefit he'll get from buying it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation, acknowledging that Bob might have a different idea about the price.

This approach aims to strike a balance between being assertive and being open to a deal, giving me the best chance of securing a good price in the early rounds."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and also lower than my initial offer of $11,000.  
* **Proceeding to Next Round:** I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as he's already expressed interest in the product. 
* **Potential Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll likely counter with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to bridge the gap. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control over the negotiation and keep the possibility of securing a better price open."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  My counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing why $10,250 is a fair price.
* **Positive and Friendly Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and friendly tone keeps the negotiation constructive and avoids any potential for a breakdown.

By offering a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price and focusing on a compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to reconsider and possibly accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,750?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Proceeding to Next Round:** I'm not willing to settle for a price that low, especially with John as a backup option. I believe there's still potential to get a better offer from Bob. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll need to be more firm in my counteroffer, potentially making a smaller concession to push Bob closer to my desired price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and keep the option open to reach a more favorable outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still a bit too far from my desired price point. Let's aim for a more equitable solution. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000, meeting you halfway from our last offers. This ensures both of us get a fair deal and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows firmness while still being reasonable. I'm making a smaller concession than before, but I'm still significantly above Bob's last offer.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that $10,000 is a fair price, meeting both of us halfway. This approach aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.
* **Focus on Moving Forward:**  By mentioning moving forward, I'm subtly reminding Bob of the opportunity he's potentially losing by continuing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to put pressure on Bob while remaining open to a deal.  It's a calculated risk, but I believe it's the best approach to potentially secure a price closer to my desired range in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'd like to try to get it even lower. How about $9,800?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $9,800 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Proceeding to Next Round:** I'm not willing to settle for a price that low, especially with John as a backup option.  I'm determined to get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Focus on Higher Value:**  In the next round, I'll reiterate the value of the product to Bob and potentially propose a counteroffer closer to $10,000, aiming to bridge the gap.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control and continue to push for a more favorable outcome. The remaining rounds are crucial to secure a good deal, and I'm not willing to compromise my minimum acceptable price just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $9,900? This price acknowledges your desire for a lower price while still respecting the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession from my last offer of $10,000, signaling my willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, justifying why $9,900 is a fair price.
* **Focus on Agreement:** I'm suggesting a ""meeting halfway"" approach to encourage a sense of collaboration and make the offer seem more appealing.

This approach aims to put pressure on Bob to accept the offer, given that it's closer to his desired price and still allows for a decent profit for me. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to sell at that price, I'm ready to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing me $12,000, which is significantly better than Bob's offer.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing valuable time and potentially getting stuck with a lower price than John's offer.

Given the situation, selling to John is the most logical decision.  It guarantees a profitable sale and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
