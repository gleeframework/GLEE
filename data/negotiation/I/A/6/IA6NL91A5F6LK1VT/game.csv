"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and hopefully, it's a starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,875,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,875,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit stretched. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000. This feels like a fair price point given the value I see in the product.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
