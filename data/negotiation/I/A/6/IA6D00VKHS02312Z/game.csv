,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit,  how about $7,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's do $7,250. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",7250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  How about we settle at $7,100? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,100 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $7,150? This is a very fair price and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",7150.0,Alice,7,
