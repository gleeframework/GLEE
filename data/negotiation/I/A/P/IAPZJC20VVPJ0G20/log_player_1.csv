``` 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,475,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  Even at $1,475,000, I am exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 by a considerable margin.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing negotiations runs the risk of Bob becoming frustrated and walking away. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I can deploy the funds sooner, potentially generating further returns.

Accepting $1,475,000 balances risk and reward effectively at this stage."
