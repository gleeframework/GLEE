,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $87.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $87.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88.50.  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",88.5,Alice,5,
