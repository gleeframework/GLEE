"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still ensuring a decent profit. I'm also highlighting the value of the product for Bob to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than $100.  I'll counter with a lower price, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm lowering my price by $5, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $87.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, $87.50 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to keep negotiating but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $100.  I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm getting closer to walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $87.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88.50.  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
``` 

I'm raising my offer slightly to $88.50, showing that I'm still interested in making a deal.  I'm also making it clear that this is my final offer, putting the pressure on Bob to decide.  I'm hoping that Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he doesn't."
