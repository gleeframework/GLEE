"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its market value."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
