Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer the product at my minimum ($150), there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price. This allows me to potentially earn more than selling directly to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a price point that's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but still allows room for him to feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** By having John as a guaranteed buyer, I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
