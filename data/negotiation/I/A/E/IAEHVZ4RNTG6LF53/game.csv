"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's an even greater value for you. I'm starting with a price of $1450000.  This reflects the product's worth and allows room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you place on it, but I would like to propose a lower price of $1300000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth to me, while still leaving room for negotiation. I look forward to your response.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to need to come back with a counteroffer.  $1300000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This still gives you a significant advantage, and it's a price that works for me.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1350000 for the product. This price reflects what I consider to be a fair valuation while still allowing for some room for further discussion. I hope this proposal meets your needs and allows us to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Your latest offer is getting closer, but I'm going to need a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1375000.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a good price while allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this deal happen.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
