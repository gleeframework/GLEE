"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing this further. ",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,175,000?  This accounts for some of your budget concerns while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,175,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
