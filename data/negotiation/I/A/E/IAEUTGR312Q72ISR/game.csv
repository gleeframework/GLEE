"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $65 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $77? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",77.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about $70? That's a fair price.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the direction we're heading, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short on profit. How about we try $75? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for the quality of the product.",75.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit more, but $75 is still pushing it for me.  Would you do $72, as my final offer?",72.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $72. I'll meet you halfway between $75 and $72, which is $73. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",73.0,Alice,7,
