"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little too high for me right now. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to facilitate a deal. This still leaves a comfortable margin for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,100,000. This would be a fair compromise, and would allow us to both walk away satisfied with the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
