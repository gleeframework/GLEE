"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I could do $9,000.  I think that's a fair price considering John is offering a similar product for $10,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is too low for me. I know this product is valuable and I'm confident it's worth more to you than John's product. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
