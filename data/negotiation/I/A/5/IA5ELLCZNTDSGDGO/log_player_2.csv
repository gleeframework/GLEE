"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than what you're willing to pay ($1,000,000) and significantly higher than her own valuation ($800,000). 
* You have a better alternative: buying from John for $1,000,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her later or simply proceed with buying from John."
