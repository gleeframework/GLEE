,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $100 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. While $105 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's meet in the middle at $108.  This would allow me to cover my costs and still give you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",108.0,Alice,5,
