"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer by highlighting the product's potential benefit to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $100 offer gives Bob some room to counter without feeling like he's being completely unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Potential:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal outcome. 
* **Negotiation Space:** Rejecting allows me to counter and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While $80 from John is guaranteed, I believe there's still a good chance of getting more from Bob. I'm willing to take the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to keep Bob motivated.
* **Strategic Discount:**  $95 still gives me a decent profit, but also leaves room for Bob to counter if he's truly determined to get a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on Goal:** $92 is close to my ideal price point, and it's a significant improvement over John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try for another round, there's no guarantee of a higher offer. It's better to lock in a profit that's only slightly lower than my initial goal.
* **Time is Money:**  With limited rounds, it's crucial to make a decision that maximizes my profit within the time constraints."
