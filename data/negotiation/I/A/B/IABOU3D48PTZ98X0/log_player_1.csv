"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $13,500. It's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth more than $10,000, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $13,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Although I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $11,750 makes the most sense at this point. It's a reasonable compromise, exceeding my minimum selling price and avoiding the risk of losing the sale altogether."
