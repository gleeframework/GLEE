Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $15000 for your product. Let me know if this is something you can work with.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell for $16,500.  This allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $16000 for your product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $16,000 is a good price and a fair compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $15,000, and I'm confident I can get a good deal on something else."
