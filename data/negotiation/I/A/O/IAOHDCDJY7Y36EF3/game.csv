"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was expecting a bit more enthusiasm considering its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also shows I'm willing to work with you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not convinced that $1450000 is the best price for this product.
