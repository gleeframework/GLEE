"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it, but I have to say, I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value to me. I'm thinking of starting at $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering its value to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your serious offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $1,025,000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great deal for you too.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a little too high for me.  Considering its value to me, I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair offer, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal. What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $975,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,050,000? It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your target, but $1,050,000 is still pushing my limit.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,000,000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I will need to explore other options.  Let me know if you're willing to close the deal at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,075,000. This is my last concession, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
