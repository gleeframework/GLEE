Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 creates a win-win scenario.  Bob gets a $2,000 discount from his perceived value, and we make a $1,000 profit over John's offer.
* **Open Communication:** The message aims for a collaborative tone, making Bob feel more comfortable accepting."
