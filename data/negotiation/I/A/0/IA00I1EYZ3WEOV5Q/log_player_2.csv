"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's best to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Do you think that would work?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This starts the negotiation significantly below Alice's valuation, but still leaves room to go up if necessary. It's important to appear serious about the purchase but also firm on the budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is too low, I could come down to $130. I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but it's still too high. We should continue negotiating and try to meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little ways off at that price. Would you consider $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

This counter-offer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range of our budget and leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $112.50? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and even splitting the difference puts us above our budget. John offers a guaranteed price at our maximum, so it's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice."
