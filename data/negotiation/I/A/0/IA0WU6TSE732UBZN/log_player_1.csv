Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$110:** This price is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a price that's reasonable and gives you some wiggle room to potentially make a profit.
* **Message:** I've kept the message simple and straightforward, focusing on the value proposition of the product. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start with a high price and see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects my offer, I can then adjust my price downwards based on his counteroffer. If we reach a point where we can't agree on a price, I can always fall back on selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:** While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Selling to John for $100 is still a better option at this point.
* **Next Round:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range. This keeps the negotiation open and gives me a chance to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're working with a budget of $80.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than that."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $95:** This is a compromise between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $80. It's a reasonable price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's budget constraint and expressed my willingness to compromise, while still maintaining a firm stance on my price. This builds rapport and shows flexibility while conveying that I'm not willing to go too low.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to aim for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being within a range that Bob might be willing to accept. By offering a compromise, I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not giving away too much."
