"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I've found another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for that amount. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product.  Let's try to meet in the middle and make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not able to meet you at $9,000. Given the current market conditions and the value I place on this product, I believe $8,500 would be a fair compromise. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $8,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,750?  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Alice,5,
