"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,500? I'm serious about buying this product, but that's the most I can afford right now.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  To make this work for both of us, how about $13,000?  It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
