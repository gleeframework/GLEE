"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You are trying to save as much money as possible, and $14,000 is still more than your limit of $12,000. You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,500? I'm serious about buying this product, but that's the most I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  To make this work for both of us, how about $13,000?  It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your limit.  It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum price of $12,000.  You don't want to risk further negotiation with Alice potentially ending in a higher price."
