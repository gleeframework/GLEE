Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
