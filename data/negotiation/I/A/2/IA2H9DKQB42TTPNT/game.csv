"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Let's try $1,200,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price point.  However, I value our discussion and would like to find an agreement with you.  My final offer is $1,450,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1,450,000 is still pushing my limits.  To make this work, I can offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
