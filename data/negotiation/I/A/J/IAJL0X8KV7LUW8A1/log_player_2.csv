"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

$20,000 is way over Bob's budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle; how about $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over what he's comfortable spending. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob has been trying to negotiate with Alice, but it seems she's not willing to go lower than $13,000.  This is still more than Bob is comfortable spending.  He's better off buying from John for $8,000."
