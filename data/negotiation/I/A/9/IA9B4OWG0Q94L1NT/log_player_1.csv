Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the maximum value Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate, but still ensuring I get a decent profit. I've also added a friendly message to establish a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, I am willing to accept a price of $12,000, so I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and do $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not quite there. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,500 is still below what I need.  How about we settle on $12,500? This is a fair compromise and would allow both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we both want to be satisfied. How about $12,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I've reached my goal of getting at least $12,000 for the product, so I'm going to accept his offer."
