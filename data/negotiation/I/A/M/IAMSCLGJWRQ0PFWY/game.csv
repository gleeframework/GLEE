"Hello Bob, I have a great opportunity for you to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8500 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit too high. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8500.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8500 and $11000, which is $9750. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $9750 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a better price.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8500. This is my absolute best offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your best offer being $8500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $9500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",9500.0,Alice,7,
