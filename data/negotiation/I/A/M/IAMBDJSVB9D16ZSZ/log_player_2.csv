"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's always advantageous to negotiate further, especially since Bob has a fallback option with John."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While that's a significant difference from my initial asking price, I'm willing to move down to $1,100,000. I believe this product's value will far exceed that for your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, she's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. The option of buying from John for $1,000,000 remains a solid safety net."
