Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $12,000. This is a good middle ground between my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and Bob's maximum value of $15,000. This allows for a good profit margin for me while still being attractive to Bob.  

If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $8,000, so there is no risk in making this offer."
