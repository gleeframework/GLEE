"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** Our goal is to get the product for as close to $60 as possible, maximizing our savings. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This counteroffer gives Alice the opportunity to counter back, and we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for your offer.  $60 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our ideal price. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John since we've achieved the best possible outcome."
