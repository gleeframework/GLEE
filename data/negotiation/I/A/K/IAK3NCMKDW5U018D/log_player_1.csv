Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel valued.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question invites Bob to respond and gives him a chance to counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and keeping the negotiation open. It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I won't sell the product for less than $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is clearly interested and has shown a willingness to negotiate. There's potential to reach a mutually acceptable price in the next round.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about $12,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's last offer ($11,500). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and presenting my counteroffer as a ""fair price"".
* **Clear and concise:** I'm keeping my message brief and to the point.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and remaining open to negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will either accept this offer or come back with a counteroffer closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  How about $12,250?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,250 is just $250 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Bob won't budge much more.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I have the opportunity to sell to John for $12,000 if I don't reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This decision is a balance of maximizing profit and minimizing risk. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale close to my minimum, and I can always sell to John if this deal falls through. It's also important to consider that continuing to negotiate may not lead to a significantly higher price."
