"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be of great benefit to your business.  My asking price is $1,200,000. This reflects the significant value I place on this product. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this price is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but less than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's benefits and the ""fairness"" of the price to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states my willingness to negotiate, signaling flexibility without compromising on my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** 
* **I have 9 rounds remaining, and I want to maximize my profit.** There's still potential for negotiation. 
* **Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but it's not the best-case scenario.** 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round to try to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, recognizing the value you see in the product. This price represents a significant compromise on my end and allows for some room for negotiation. I'm confident that this offer reflects a fair balance between our needs. Let's continue this discussion and work towards a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that is lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm flexible but also firm on my bottom line.
* **Highlight Value:** I reiterate the value Bob sees in the product to strengthen my position.
* **Compromise and Negotiation:** I emphasize that my counteroffer represents a compromise on my part and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Mutual Agreement:** The message emphasizes seeking a mutually agreeable deal, fostering a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Given your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** 
* **This is a good deal for me, as I'm not going to get a better offer.** 
* **There's no point in risking another round of negotiation.** While I could try to get more, there's no guarantee I will succeed, and I could potentially end up losing the deal altogether.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum desired price, ensuring a profitable outcome."
