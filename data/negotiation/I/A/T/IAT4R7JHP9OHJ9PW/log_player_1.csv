Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $1,000,000 is higher than the $800,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's significantly less than my minimum:** This leaves space for potential counteroffers and negotiations, allowing me to maximize my profit.
* **It shows a willingness to compromise:**  This approach demonstrates that I'm open to a deal, which is more likely to lead to a positive outcome.

I'm prepared to accept a counteroffer if necessary, but I also have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with $1,000,000. Given my budget, I can only go as high as $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential savings for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial willingness to pay ($800,000), it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay my full asking price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Showing a willingness to walk away demonstrates my confidence and strengthens my position.
* **Explore potential for a better deal:**  I can counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome.
* **Preserve my minimum profit:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss, while selling to John guarantees my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some negotiation room. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above my minimum:** This counteroffer keeps my profit above the $1,200,000 threshold while being more appealing to Bob than my previous offer.
* **Compromise and negotiation:**  By offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, I demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  I still have John as a backup buyer, giving me the freedom to walk away if this counteroffer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $925,000 is still slightly outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This represents a significant saving for you and allows me to stay within my financial limits. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob has increased his offer to $875,000, this is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have John as a guaranteed buyer who's willing to pay my full asking price.  

By selling to John, I ensure:

* **Maximum profit:**  This guarantees the highest possible return for the product. 
* **No further negotiation:**  It eliminates the need for any further back-and-forth with Bob, saving time and effort.
* **Certainty and stability:**  It provides a secure and reliable outcome without the risk of further negotiation. 

While Bob's offer is slightly better than before, it doesn't come close to my minimum acceptable value.  Therefore, selling to John is the most logical and profitable choice in this scenario."
