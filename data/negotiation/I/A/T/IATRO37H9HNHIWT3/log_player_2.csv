Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your creative suggestion, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10500. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
