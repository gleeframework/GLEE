"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.  How about $1,150,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $1,125,000? This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair and mutually beneficial price.  Let's close this deal!",1125000.0,Alice,5,
