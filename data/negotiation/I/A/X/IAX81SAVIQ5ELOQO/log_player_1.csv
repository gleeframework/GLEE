Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have 6 rounds left to try and negotiate a higher price. I'm willing to take the risk of losing the deal with Bob and see if I can get a better offer from him or even sell to John if it comes down to it."
