"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects the value I place on the product and still gives you a good deal. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This price reflects the true value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
