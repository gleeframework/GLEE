"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which reflects its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
