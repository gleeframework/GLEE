Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding my minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Adding a time constraint (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to make a decision quicker, avoiding a lost sale to John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation skills or willingness to pay more than $100."
