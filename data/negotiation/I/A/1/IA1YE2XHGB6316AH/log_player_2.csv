"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $7,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is already a good deal, but there's no harm in seeing if I can get it even lower. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping to spend a little less. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $6,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $6,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is suggesting we ""meet in the middle"" which is a common negotiation tactic. However, the middle ground between our previous offers is $6,400, not $6,800. I'll offer a price slightly below her suggested price to see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about we settle on $6,600? That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 6600
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going up to $6,600. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $6,900. This is the final price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's not as low as I might have hoped, it's still a significant saving compared to John's price. It's time to accept and close the deal."
