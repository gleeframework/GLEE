Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You're still leaving yourself some room to negotiate upwards.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** $1,250,000 is halfway between your minimum and Bob's maximum.

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair deal considering it's less valuable to me than it is to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $800,000, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value this product has for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
