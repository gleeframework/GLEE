"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair deal considering it's less valuable to me than it is to you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value this product has for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I hope you'll consider it.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
