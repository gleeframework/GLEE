"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. This product has a lot of value, and I'm confident it can bring you significant benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
