Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  There's no point in further negotiation with Bob."
