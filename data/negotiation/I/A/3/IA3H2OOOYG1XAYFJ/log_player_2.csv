"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's minimum desired price. There's room for negotiation, so it's beneficial for Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  This counteroffer is aggressive, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to push Alice closer to her desired price.
* **Shows Willingness to Compromise:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product and his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Sets the Stage for Future Rounds:** This counteroffer establishes a clear price range for the negotiation, which will help shape future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I think the product's value is higher than $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, and the price is now only $50,000 above what Bob was initially willing to pay.  
* **Good Value:** While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John is high. This price represents a good value for Bob compared to John's offer.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds, and Bob may end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
