Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals.
