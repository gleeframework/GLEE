"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it can bring to your business.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
