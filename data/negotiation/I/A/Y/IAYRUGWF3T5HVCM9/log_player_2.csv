Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  John is still offering a better deal at $800,000.  Bob should try to counteroffer Alice again."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. Although Alice has come down in price, she's still asking for $850,000, which is higher than John's offer. At this point, it's more efficient for Bob to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
