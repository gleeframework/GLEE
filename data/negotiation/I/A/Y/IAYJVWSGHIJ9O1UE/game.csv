"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise considering the value it brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this, but I can't go above $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value I'll get out of it and it's a step closer to your offer.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
