"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to you.

You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise considering the value it brings to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. He should try to negotiate further with Alice, as there is a chance she might be willing to go lower."

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above his maximum budget, and it's unlikely she'll go lower. It's better to secure the product for a lower price from John, even if it means not getting the product from Alice."
