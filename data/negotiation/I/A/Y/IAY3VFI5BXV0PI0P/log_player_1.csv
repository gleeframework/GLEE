Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a bit higher than my minimum value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It's also a price that hopefully seems fair to Bob, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $13,500 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, as it's closer to his offer than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,000.  While it's not ideal, it's still above my minimum and a decent outcome given the negotiation.  Continuing to bargain might result in a lower price, and I'm not confident I can get significantly closer to my initial goal.  Selling to John at this point would mean a lower profit."
