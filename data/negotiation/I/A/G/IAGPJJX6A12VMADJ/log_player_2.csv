{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! This is an interesting product, but I'm hoping to find a deal that's within my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

* **Leave room to negotiate:** A $10,000 offer still leaves space for further negotiation."

```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11800. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close:**  The offer is only $800 over your last counteroffer.
* **Reaching a stalemate:**  Further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a significantly lower price.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If you reject this offer, Alice might not counter again, and you could end up paying more for the product from John.
* **Small compromise:**  Paying $800 more than your last offer is a small compromise for a potentially unique and desirable product."
