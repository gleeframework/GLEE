"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, and he's willing to pay a maximum of $120. Alice's offer of $160 is too high. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his maximum price point of $120. This is the highest price he's willing to pay, and it's still below Alice's value of $150.  This counteroffer creates a starting point for negotiation and signals Bob's serious intent to purchase the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $140 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his target.  There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to find a price that is acceptable to both parties.  $130 is a compromise, as it's halfway between Bob's previous offer of $120 and Alice's current offer of $140.  This shows Bob is willing to negotiate, but is still trying to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $135 is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but it's still above his target. While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, it's risky. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and the negotiation process could drag on. Buying from John for $120 ensures Bob gets the product at his maximum price, avoids the risk of further negotiation, and saves time and effort."
