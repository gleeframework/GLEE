"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, Bob! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You can get the product from John for a lower price, making rejecting Alice's offer the best option."
