Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  I could meet you halfway at $12,500.  This is my final offer.

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and it's still above John's price.  There's no point in further negotiation. It's more advantageous to buy from John at this point."
