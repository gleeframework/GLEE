Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but I can only go up to $105 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $108 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired range. I will continue to negotiate with Bob in the hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but I need to at least get $112 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value and the time we've spent negotiating.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 112}
