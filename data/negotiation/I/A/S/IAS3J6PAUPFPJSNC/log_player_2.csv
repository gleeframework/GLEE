"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $10,000 is above his maximum budget, so accepting the offer is not a good option. Buying from John immediately for $8,000 is the best outcome, but Bob should see if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice first.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $10,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? I'm really looking for a good deal here."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still above his maximum budget, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows that he is serious about buying the product but is also trying to negotiate a price he is comfortable with.  He is hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He can either try to counteroffer again or buy from John if the negotiation doesn't go in his favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,250 is closer, but still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,800?  This is a price that's fair for both of us and gets the deal done."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, offering a price that is still a bit higher than his maximum budget, but closer to Alice's last offer.  He's hoping to find a middle ground that allows him to save some money while also showing Alice that he's serious about purchasing the product.  This counteroffer also reinforces his desire to reach a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has declared this to be her ""final offer"" and is threatening to move on to other buyers.  While $9,000 is better than her initial offer, it is still outside Bob's budget. Bob has a guaranteed deal with John at $8,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation to potentially lose this deal and possibly end up paying more with another seller."
