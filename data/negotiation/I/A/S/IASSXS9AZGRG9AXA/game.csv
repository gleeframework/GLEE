,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still make a significant profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows me to get a good return on my investment while still giving you a valuable asset. Let's find common ground here! ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good return, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still make a decent profit.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a reasonable price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal and finalize it.",975000.0,Bob,6,
