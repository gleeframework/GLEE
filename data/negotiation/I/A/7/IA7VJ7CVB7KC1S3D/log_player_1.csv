"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't want to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. While I could potentially get a bit more by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, or I'll run out of rounds. Accepting his offer guarantees me $10,250, which is more than I'd get from John."
