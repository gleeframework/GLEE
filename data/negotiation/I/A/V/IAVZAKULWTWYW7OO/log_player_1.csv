Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it would be very beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $119 maximizes your potential profit. Bob gets a $1 discount (which might be enticing), and you secure almost the full value he places on the item. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since you have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, aiming high with Bob is a calculated risk worth taking."
