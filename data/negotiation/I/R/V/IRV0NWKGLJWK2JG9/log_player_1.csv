Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above my minimum:** Bob's offer is above my minimum of $120, which is my safety net. 
* **Limited time:**  I only have two rounds left to negotiate. It's unlikely I can secure a significantly better price with such limited time.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away entirely, and I'd be left with only John's offer of $120.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale above my minimum and allows me to avoid the risk of ending up with only John's offer."
