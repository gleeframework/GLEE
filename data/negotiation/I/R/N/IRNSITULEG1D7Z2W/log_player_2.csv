"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, it's not the best possible deal.  There are still rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a better strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal you're offering, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so a price of $12,000 gives Alice a profit while also giving Bob a decent discount. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point, and $13,000 is a good compromise. Bob is still saving $2,000 compared to buying from John, and there's a chance that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price. It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product."
