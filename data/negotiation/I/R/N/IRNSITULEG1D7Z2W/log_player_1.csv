Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal you're offering, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 13000}
