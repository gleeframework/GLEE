"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price of $12,000, which is still a decent amount for Bob, but also allows me some room to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price of $10,000. It's not ideal, but it's a good deal, and it's better than risking further negotiation and potentially getting nothing.  I'll take it."
