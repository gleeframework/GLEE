Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it has the potential to generate significant value for you, and I'm confident it's worth considerably more than the asking price.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,490,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 1490000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim higher. Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 is our floor.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,490,000 is just below my guaranteed price but leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a ""deal."" The slight discount might entice him to act quickly. 
* **Urgency:**  The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach adds a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to overthink or try to negotiate further.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
