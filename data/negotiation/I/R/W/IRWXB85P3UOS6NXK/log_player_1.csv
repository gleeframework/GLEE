{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000 is a starting point:**  It's a price that is higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the product for my minimum price right away.

This is a good starting point.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob, given he understands the value of the product. 
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting his offer shows that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 

I will now counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $10,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle.  Would you consider $13,000? It's a fair compromise and still allows you to get a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's, but lower than my initial offer:**  I'm showing flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my minimum.
* **Positive language:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and focusing on finding a compromise.
* **Reasoning for the counteroffer:**  I'm explaining my reasoning for not accepting Bob's offer, making it less likely he'll feel like I'm being unreasonable. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my financial limits while acknowledging the value of what you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $12,000 is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product.
* **No reason to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee I'll get a better price from Bob, and I could end up selling to John for the same amount.
* **Secure the deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price. 

While it would be nice to earn more, accepting this offer ensures a successful transaction and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
