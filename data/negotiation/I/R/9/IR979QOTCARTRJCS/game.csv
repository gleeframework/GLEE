"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,000 for your product. Let me know if this is acceptable.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,100 for your product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",9100.0,Bob,4,
