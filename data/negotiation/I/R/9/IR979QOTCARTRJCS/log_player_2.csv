Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.
