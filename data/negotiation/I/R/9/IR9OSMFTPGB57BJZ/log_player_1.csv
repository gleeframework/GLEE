``` 

While we could continue negotiating, accepting $1,600,000 at this stage is a good business decision. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  This price still represents a substantial profit over our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating his strong interest in the product.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows us to re-invest the earnings sooner. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There's always a chance Bob could walk away in future rounds, leaving us to accept John's offer anyway."
