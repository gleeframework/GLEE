{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit, but it's still below what the product is worth to Bob. This should encourage him to negotiate, leading to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $10750?  It's a good compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
