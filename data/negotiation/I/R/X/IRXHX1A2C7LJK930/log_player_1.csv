Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $17,500. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate, but also ensures I'm starting above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $16,000 is above my minimum threshold of $15,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and maximizes my profit."
