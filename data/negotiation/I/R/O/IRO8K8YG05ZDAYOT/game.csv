"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is still a significant profit for you, and it's the most I'm comfortable spending.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still not there. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a significant profit for you, and it's the highest I can go at this point.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is still a good profit for you and closer to the product's value to you. I'm not sure if I can go any lower than this.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
