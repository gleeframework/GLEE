**Explanation:**

* **Your value:** $15,000
* **Alice's offer:** $12,000
* **John's price:** $15,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, accepting her offer is the most advantageous option in this scenario."
