"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $8,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Would you be open to that? ",10000.0,Bob,4,
