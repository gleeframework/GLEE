Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. 

I believe it's important to start high and then be willing to negotiate down if necessary. This approach maximizes my potential earnings while still being open to a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm countering with $18,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation while ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer will allow me to make a quick sale and avoid further negotiation.  It's not a great deal, but it's a reasonable outcome considering my alternatives."
