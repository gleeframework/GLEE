"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product is worth significantly less to me than your initial asking price. I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,650,000. This reflects the product's worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to me.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a fair compromise here.  While $1,200,000 is still less than I'd like, I'll accept $1,400,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to work with you.  Let me know your decision.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
