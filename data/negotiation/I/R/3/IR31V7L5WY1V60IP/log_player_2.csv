"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1100000. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can potentially save $100,000 by negotiating with Alice or simply buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  I can either attempt to get a lower price from Alice or simply buy from John and save myself the hassle of further negotiations."
