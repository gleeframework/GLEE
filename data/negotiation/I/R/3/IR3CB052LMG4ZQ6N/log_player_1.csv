Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I believe this is a very competitive price for the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14999}
``` 

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for slightly less and still make a profit, aiming high initially gives room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Just Below My Guarantee:** Offering it just below my guaranteed sale price with John creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone of the message implies I'm open to discussing the price further, allowing Bob to feel like he might get a better deal."
