Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut the negotiations with Alice. While she's getting closer to your desired price, she's unlikely to go as low as John's offer of $8,000. You've reached a point where continuing the negotiation might not yield a better outcome."
