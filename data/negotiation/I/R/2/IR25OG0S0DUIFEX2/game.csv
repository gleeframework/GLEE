"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to make an offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your interest in it. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider coming down to $7,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
