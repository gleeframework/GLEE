"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10750? ",10750.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to come down a bit. How about $11000? This is still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts!",11000.0,Alice,3,
