"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's close to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to create a friendly and cooperative atmosphere. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential value of the product. 

I'm aiming to get the best price possible while also keeping the negotiations open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While $10,750 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired range in the next round, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer now keeps the negotiation open and prevents me from settling too quickly. I want to see how far Bob is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to come down a bit. How about $11,000? This is still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price slightly from the previous round.
* **Still Profitable:** $11,000 is still above my minimum desired price of $10,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm using positive language to keep the communication open and encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10900, but that's my absolute limit. If you're willing to come down a little, I'm ready to close the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $10,900 is very close to my minimum desired price of $10,000. 
* **Limited Negotiation:** Bob has stated his absolute limit, suggesting further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing a deal this close to my target.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $11,000, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
