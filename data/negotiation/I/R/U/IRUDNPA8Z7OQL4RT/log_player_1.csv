Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer I'd send:

**Strategy**

The key here is understanding your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). You have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives you significant leverage.  

While Bob's valuation is lower than yours, there's still room for a profitable deal. Offering a price slightly above Bob's valuation allows you to capture some additional value.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This offer represents a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that will undoubtedly benefit your business."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob.  
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 is strategically placed:
    * It's well above Bob's valuation, leaving you room to potentially negotiate lower if needed.
    * It's significantly below your guaranteed sale price to John, ensuring you're making a substantial profit even if you have to slightly adjust downwards.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation tactics (e.g., aggressive, collaborative), you can tailor your message and opening offer accordingly.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower opening offer to demonstrate goodwill.
