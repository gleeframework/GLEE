"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to own a piece valued at $15,000 for a limited time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our previous discussion, I am willing to lower the price to $10,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing a fair return for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly less than John's price of $15,000 and only slightly more than Bob's counteroffer of $9,500.  It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a small decrease in price, and there's a risk that Alice will walk away entirely.  Accepting the offer at $10,500 is the most pragmatic choice, balancing price savings with the potential risk of losing the product."
