"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm getting closer to my goal, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  This represents a significant savings for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to save as much as possible, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,340,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
