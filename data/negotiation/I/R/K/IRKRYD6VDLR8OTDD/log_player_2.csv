# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to save as much as possible, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,340,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a counteroffer, and it's possible that the price will go even higher.  At this point, John's offer is the most secure way to get the product at a price within Bob's budget."
