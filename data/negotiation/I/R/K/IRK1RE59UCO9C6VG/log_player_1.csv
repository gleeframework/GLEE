"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and upfront about my willingness to negotiate. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage. 

**Reasoning:**

I want to maximize my profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. Starting with a price above his perceived value gives me leverage, but I'm not being unreasonable. I also want to make sure Bob understands that I'm open to negotiation, so he's more likely to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I need to try and get closer to that number.

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging John:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000. This gives me the flexibility to be more demanding in my negotiations with Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to pay more than his initial $8,000 valuation. This means there's still room for us to find a middle ground. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. This will be a strategic move to push the negotiations in my favor."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $10,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $9,000. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while making it clear that I'm not willing to go lower than $10,000.  I'm also emphasizing the willingness to compromise by suggesting a meeting point.

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to My Target:**  By offering $10,000, I'm moving closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Showing Flexibility:** The ""meeting halfway"" approach demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to see the value in continuing the negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving in completely. This maintains my leverage and increases the chances of getting a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $12,000 to $10,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:** While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal. I'm not willing to settle for that yet.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, so I can afford to be more patient and hold out for a better deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to go higher than his initial $8,000 valuation, meaning there's still room for compromise.
* **Seeking Higher Value:** I want to see if I can push Bob to come closer to my ideal price, which is closer to $11,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than my ideal.  I'll continue to explore the possibility of getting closer to a deal that's more favorable to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,500. That's closer to what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? I'm confident this will be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's willingness to move closer to my price and framing it as a positive opportunity for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Momentum:** By sticking to $10,000, I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward without making too big of a concession.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** The ""splitting the difference"" approach creates an impression of fairness and encourages Bob to see the value in accepting my offer.
* **Closing the Gap:** $10,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's a significant improvement from previous offers and brings me closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,750, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:**  While $9,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more, especially with John as a backup option.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:** My backup offer from John gives me the ability to be more selective and hold out for a better price. 
* **Seeking a Higher Price:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that's significantly below my ideal.
* **Room for Compromise:** Bob's offer shows he's willing to move closer to my desired price, suggesting there's still room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his current offer, but still lower than my ideal price of $11,000. I'll continue to negotiate in hopes of closing the deal at a more favorable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway at $9,750. While I'm closer to your price, I'm still a bit off.  How about we try $9,900?  It's a small step closer to your offer and shows we're both willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,900, which is a small increase from Bob's last offer of $9,750. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's effort to compromise and positioning my offer as a small step in the right direction.

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm  making a small concession to keep the negotiation moving forward and show my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** My backup offer from John allows me to be more assertive and try to push for a higher price.
* **Increasing Pressure:**  This small counteroffer puts pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal entirely.

**Next Steps:**

* I'm hoping Bob will accept my offer at $9,900, as it's closer to his last offer and represents a significant increase from his initial offer.
* If he rejects, I'll have to assess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer or go ahead with my sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:**  While $9,800 is a decent price, I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risk of losing the deal with Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in the eighth round, and with only two rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting. There's a risk that we won't be able to reach an agreement before my deadline.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John offers a guaranteed sale for $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value and offers a much safer outcome.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting my offer and leaving me with no sale at all. It's a gamble that I'm not willing to take at this point.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob,  the guaranteed profit from John is too tempting to pass up. It's a safe and lucrative option, and with limited time remaining, it's the most sensible decision."
