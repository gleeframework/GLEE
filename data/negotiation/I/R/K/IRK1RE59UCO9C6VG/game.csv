"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,500. That's closer to what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? I'm confident this will be a great deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway at $9,750. While I'm closer to your price, I'm still a bit off.  How about we try $9,900?  It's a small step closer to your offer and shows we're both willing to compromise.",9900.0,Alice,7,,
