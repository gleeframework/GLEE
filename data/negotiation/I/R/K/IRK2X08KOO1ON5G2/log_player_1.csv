Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the market value of this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,450,000 represents a fair value, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This acknowledges the product's worth while recognizing your budget considerations."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,150,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving in the right direction, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a result significantly better than John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000."
