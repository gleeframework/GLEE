"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the market value of this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,450,000 represents a fair value, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This acknowledges the product's worth while recognizing your budget considerations.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,150,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
