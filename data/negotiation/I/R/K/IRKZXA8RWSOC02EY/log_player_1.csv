Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $15,000 on it. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a price closer to $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our financial positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
