"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I have another offer for $800,000.  If you're able to match that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
