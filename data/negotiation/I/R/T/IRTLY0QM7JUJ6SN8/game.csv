"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is way too low for me. This product has a lot of value that I think you'd appreciate. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I do see the value in the product,  $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  $9,500 is still quite a way from what I had in mind. Could you meet me at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  I can see you value this product, and I do too. How about splitting the difference again and settling at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
