Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. 
* This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* It's also less than the product's worth to Bob, leaving him with a profit margin of $50,000. 
* This price offers a good balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizing profit:** I'm aiming for a high price, but not so high that it would be a sure rejection.
* **Motivating Bob:** The $50,000 profit margin is a reasonable incentive for Bob to accept the offer.
* **Safeguarding against rejection:** Even if Bob rejects, I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I won't lose out completely."
