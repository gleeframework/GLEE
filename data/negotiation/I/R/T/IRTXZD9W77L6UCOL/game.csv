"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still be happy with the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $10,250? This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product.",10250.0,Bob,4,
