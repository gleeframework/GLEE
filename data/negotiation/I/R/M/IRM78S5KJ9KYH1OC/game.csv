"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1500000? I believe this might be closer to what we can agree upon.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1500000 is significantly below my minimum value for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I still find $1750000 to be beyond my current budget. I would like to propose a price of $1600000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
