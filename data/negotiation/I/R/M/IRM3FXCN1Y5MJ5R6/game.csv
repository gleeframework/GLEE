"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings. How about $1,600,000? It's a significant price reduction from my initial offer, but it still allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business, while still allowing me to meet my financial goals.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
