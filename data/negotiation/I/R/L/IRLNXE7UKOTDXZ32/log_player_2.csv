"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum. He has room to negotiate and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more to you than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum value for the product. He has two options:

* **Negotiate further:** Bob can try to negotiate a lower price from Alice. He might be able to get closer to his $1,200,000 target.
* **Buy from John:** Bob can always choose to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is his maximum value. 

It's risky to accept Alice's offer because there's always a chance he could get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with her."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,210,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:** Alice's final offer of $1,210,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000.  
* **John offers a better deal:**  John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum value. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice because Bob can get a better deal elsewhere. 
* **Risk of deadlock:**  There's a risk that if Bob rejects Alice's final offer, they might reach a deadlock, and Alice might decide to sell to someone else.

By buying from John, Bob saves $10,000 and ensures he gets the product at the price he's comfortable with."
