"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $110. I believe it offers excellent value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120, and Alice's offer is $110. 
* This means there's still room for negotiation to get a better price. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I could come down a bit to $105. It's a really great product at that price, and I'm confident you'd be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $105 is within your acceptable price range of $120.
*  You've already rejected her offer of $110, so continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. 
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a price that's good for you, while still saving money compared to buying from John."
