Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, based on the information provided:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, we want to secure the highest possible price.  Offering it slightly below his valuation leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **John as a Backup:** We have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,000,000. This knowledge allows us to be more confident in aiming higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Messaging:** The message emphasizes exclusivity and fairness. This can encourage Bob to take the offer seriously and see it as a win-win scenario.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If we believe Bob is a strong negotiator, we might start with a slightly higher price to allow for concessions.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If there's urgency to the sale, we might offer a slightly lower price to ensure a quick deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
