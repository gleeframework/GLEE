"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product name] that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since you're willing to pay $100 for the product from John, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer at the same price. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but you don't have any information about her willingness to sell for less.  Rejecting the offer keeps the option open to potentially get a better deal."
