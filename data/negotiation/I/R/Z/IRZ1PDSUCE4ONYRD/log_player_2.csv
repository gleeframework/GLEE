"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is going to go straight for his maximum budget.  It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this offer, but it's the best starting point to see if there's any room for negotiation.  If Alice rejects, Bob can then use John's offer as a benchmark for future counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he still has room to negotiate further.  It's likely Alice will be willing to drop the price a bit more to close the deal, especially since she's already rejected a lower offer.  Bob can counter-offer again, and if Alice rejects, he can then consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is still significantly lower than Alice's current offer, but it's closer to a point where Alice might be willing to accept.  If Alice rejects, Bob can then evaluate the situation further and potentially consider buying from John."
