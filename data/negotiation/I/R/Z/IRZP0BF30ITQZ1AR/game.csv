"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique opportunity, $1800000 is far beyond my budget. To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value. I'm confident that you'll find it's a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest. I believe this price is fair considering the value and our ongoing negotiation. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1100000.

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $950000 for the product.

Let's see if we can finally reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
