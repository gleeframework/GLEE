"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still think $925,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $912,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",912500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  However, $912,500 is still below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $918,750.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",918750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $918,750. I'm willing to meet you at $910,000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
