"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $650,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest, however,  $650,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
