"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy this product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $600,000.  Would you be open to $575,000?",575000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go below $675,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $675,000.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $620,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",650000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to bump up my offer slightly. Would $635,000 work for you?",635000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to bump up your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $635,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $660,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",660000.0,Alice,9,
