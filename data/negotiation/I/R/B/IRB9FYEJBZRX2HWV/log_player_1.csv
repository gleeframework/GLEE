Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $180, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Being open:** I'm communicating that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to me, implying it's a good deal for Bob.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation process while keeping my options open to either accept a reasonable counteroffer from Bob or sell to John if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Potentially get a better price:**  There's a chance I can push for a price closer to my initial asking price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Test Bob's level of interest:** If he's truly interested, he's more likely to come up on his offer in the next round.
* **Maintain my position:** By rejecting his first offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell at the bare minimum.

It's a calculated risk, but in this scenario, the potential for a better deal outweighs the certainty of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my minimum, I believe this product is worth more. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, suggesting a price that's higher than his offer but lower than my initial asking price. 
* **Highlighting value again:** I'm reiterating my belief that the product is worth more, but emphasizing my willingness to compromise.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion if Bob is still hesitant.

By making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to try to save a bit more. How about we meet at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $15 below my minimum, and it's likely we're nearing a point where further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even a lower price.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob losing interest altogether, or I might end up selling to John for the same price.
* **Maximize profit:** Accepting this offer ensures a profit for me and avoids the risk of losing out on a sale. 

While $135 isn't ideal, it's a reasonable compromise that balances maximizing profit with minimizing risk."
