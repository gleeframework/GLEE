"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profits.  However, I'm aware this is a risky strategy. If Bob rejects, I'll need to adjust my approach based on his counteroffer. I'll be watching closely to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and counter-offer to get closer to my desired price point. I'll need to be careful, though, as I don't want to risk losing Bob completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better deal with him. While I could try to counter-offer again, there's no guarantee that he'll accept, and I could potentially lose the deal altogether.  Selling to John for the same price doesn't offer any advantage, and I would rather close the deal with Bob."
