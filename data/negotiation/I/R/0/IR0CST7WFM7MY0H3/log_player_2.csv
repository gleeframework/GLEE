"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $100
* **Your Maximum:** $120
* **John's Price:** $120

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you know John will sell it to you for $120.  There's a chance you could get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down in price."
