Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still ensures you're well above your minimum price.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for the maximum ($120) could make Bob feel like he's being taken advantage of and might lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
