"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it really useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but not too far off to be immediately rejected. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for some negotiation, allowing for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $140 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and also below my initial offer of $140.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, but I'm aiming for a higher price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob's acceptance.
* **Maintaining Value:** $120 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and above my minimum acceptable price."
