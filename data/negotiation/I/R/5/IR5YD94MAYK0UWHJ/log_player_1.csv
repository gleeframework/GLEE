"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll love it!  My initial offer is $150.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and trying to build a positive relationship with Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clearly stating that I'm open to negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is my minimum, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price.

Let's see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob! While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still a bit lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Highlight the value again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Keep the conversation positive:** I'm staying friendly and open to discussion.

Let's see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 threshold I set for myself. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm willing to take another round to see if I can convince Bob to go higher. There's still a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 

Let's see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $115?  That way we're both closer to our desired price and can move forward."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** I'm only asking for a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Focus on a ""win-win"":** I emphasize that this price will bring us both closer to our desired price, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Maintaining positive communication:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and focused on finding a solution. 

Let's see if this counteroffer is enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really like your product, but I'm hoping we can find a price closer to $105. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $105 is still below my minimum of $100, and I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Two rounds left:** I have two rounds left to try and get a better price from Bob. There's still a chance he might be willing to go higher.

I'm going to counter with a higher price and try to convince Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go lower than $110. It's a fair price for the value of the product, and we're close to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm holding my ground at $110, which is still higher than my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Focus on value again:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Positive closing statement:**  I'm reiterating that we're close to a deal and trying to encourage Bob to accept. 

With only three rounds left, it's time to see if we can reach an agreement!"
