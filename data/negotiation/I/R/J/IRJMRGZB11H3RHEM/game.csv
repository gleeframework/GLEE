"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay that much for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $100 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would allow both of us to get a good deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $110, which would be $105. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $105 is getting closer, I'm still a bit off my target.  I'm willing to come down to $108.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach your target, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",107.0,Bob,6,
