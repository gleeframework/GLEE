Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500 is a good starting point.** It's higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and offers Bob a $500 discount from what the product is worth to him.
* **This strategy is based on maximizing your profit while recognizing Bob's willingness to pay.** If Bob rejects the offer, you'll still get $8,000 from John, which is your minimum threshold.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, you might need to adjust the price in subsequent rounds of negotiation."
