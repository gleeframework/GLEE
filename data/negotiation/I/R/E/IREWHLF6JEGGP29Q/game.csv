,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. Can you meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $110. I can do $115, which is a bit closer to my target price. I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $108, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $108 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $102.5, but I'm willing to go up to $102.",102.0,Bob,6,
