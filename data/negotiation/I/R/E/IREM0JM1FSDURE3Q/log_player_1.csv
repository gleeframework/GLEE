Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message hints at its value by mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing. This suggests the product might be in demand or have unique value.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The message ends by asking Bob's thoughts, encouraging a dialogue and signaling potential flexibility on price.

While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright, it's a calculated one. You have John as a guaranteed backup at your minimum price. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit with Bob."
