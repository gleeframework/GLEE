"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe it will be incredibly valuable for your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 8 rounds remaining and can still negotiate with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good opportunity for profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1700000, but I'm still a bit far from that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have 6 rounds left and can potentially get closer to my desired price. Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000, so I'm going to see if I can negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiations are getting increasingly difficult. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the offers are starting to get lower than my minimum acceptable price. 

Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is a safe and secure option. It's time to stop negotiating with Bob and take the sure thing."
