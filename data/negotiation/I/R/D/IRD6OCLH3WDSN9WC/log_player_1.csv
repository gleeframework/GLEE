Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $13,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  It's only slightly above Bob's value of $12,000, giving him room to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 
* **It sets the tone:**  It shows that you're confident in your product's value and are willing to negotiate. 

Remember, you can always lower your price in subsequent rounds if Bob rejects your initial offer. However, starting with a higher price gives you more room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum of $12,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your value:**  By rejecting, you signal that you're not desperate and are willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Gain leverage:**  Bob will likely be more motivated to negotiate if he feels he's in danger of losing the deal.
* **Explore other options:**  You can use this time to see if John is still interested in buying the product, or if any other potential buyers have emerged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within reason:** This offer is a compromise, coming down from your initial $13,000 but still above your minimum. It shows you're willing to meet halfway.
* **Reiterating your value:** The message emphasizes that this price is still a good deal for Bob, highlighting the product's worth.
* **Showing flexibility:** You're signaling that you're open to continued negotiation, encouraging Bob to counter again if he's not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is still less than your initial goal, it's only $1,000 below your minimum. This is a good deal considering:

* **Negotiation progress:** Bob has shown willingness to negotiate and has come up in price from his initial offer. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to further negotiation rounds, potentially lowering the price even more.  
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could be time-consuming and might not guarantee a higher price.

 Accepting this offer allows you to make a sale quickly and with a profit that is within your acceptable range."
