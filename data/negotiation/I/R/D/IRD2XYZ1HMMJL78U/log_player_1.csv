Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the highest I can go.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I think that's a fair price for the product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go up to $13,000. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I think that's the maximum I can stretch to.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with even less."
