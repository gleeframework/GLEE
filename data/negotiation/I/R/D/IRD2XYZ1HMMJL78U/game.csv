"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the highest I can go.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,000. This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I think that's a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $10,500 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept if you can meet me at $13,000. This is a final offer to avoid wasting both our time.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go up to $13,000. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I think that's the maximum I can stretch to.",11500.0,Bob,6,
