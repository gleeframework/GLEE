# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to let you know that I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value. My initial offer is $1,200,000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you have a budget constraint, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I still believe it's worth more than $850,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to move forward with the sale.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm thinking of $1,075,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the product's value to you and my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.
