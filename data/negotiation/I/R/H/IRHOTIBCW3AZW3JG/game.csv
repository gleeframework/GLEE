"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to let you know that I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value. My initial offer is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is still higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you have a budget constraint, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I still believe it's worth more than $850,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to move forward with the sale.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the value you place on the product. Let's try to reach an agreement before we run out of time.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm thinking of $1,075,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the product's value to you and my desired price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm starting to run out of time and I'm still not sure we can reach an agreement.  I can go up to $950,000. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it reflects a fair balance of our interests.  Let's try to close this deal. ",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $950,000, but I still need to reach my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to be closer to my desired price. I'm thinking of $1,075,000 is too high, but $975,000 is a sweet spot for me. I'm willing to accept $975,000 as a final offer. This is my last counteroffer, and I hope we can close the deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,
