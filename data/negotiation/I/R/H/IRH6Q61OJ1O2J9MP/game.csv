"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal!",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $95 is a great offer, but I need to get at least $100 to make this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50.  This is my final offer, what do you say?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $97.50 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go to $96.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",96.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $96 is still a bit below what I need.  To be fair, I'm willing to lower my offer to $96.50.  This is a true compromise, and I really hope we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think!",96.5,Alice,7,
