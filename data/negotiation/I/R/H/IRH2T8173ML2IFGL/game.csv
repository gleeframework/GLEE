"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in your product, though.  How about $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still being attractive to you. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,3,
