"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $10,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the current market value.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I appreciate your perspective on the market value, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $14,000? That's a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my eagerness to work with you.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm ready to make this deal happen.  Would you consider $11,000?  That's my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're really close! I appreciate you coming up on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $15,000.  However, I value our discussions and believe you'll truly benefit from this product. If you can meet me at $13,000, we have a deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,
