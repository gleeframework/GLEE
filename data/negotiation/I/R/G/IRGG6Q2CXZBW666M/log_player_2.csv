Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised by offering it to you for $125, which is below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $115?

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your seriousness, Bob, but I've already compromised a lot. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's as high as I can go. It's a good deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

```

It's clear that Alice is not budging from this price range. It's unlikely we'll get a better deal than John's $150 offer at this point.  We've already spent considerable time negotiating and it's better to secure the product at a reasonable price."
