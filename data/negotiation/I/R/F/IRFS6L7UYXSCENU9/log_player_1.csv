Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or makes a slightly lower counter-offer more appealing.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** The $125 price point is strategically placed. It's more than Bob values the product at ($100) but less than what John is willing to pay ($150). This gives Bob a chance to get a ""deal"" while ensuring Alice still makes a profit if Bob declines.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept the offer."
