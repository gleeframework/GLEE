Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation is helpful, Alice shouldn't immediately drop to it. Starting with a price closer to her own valuation leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning the ""value"" and ""potential benefits"" aims to pique Bob's interest without revealing specific details that might weaken her position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" suggests flexibility and opens the door for Bob to counter-offer. This keeps him engaged in the process.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** The presence of John provides Alice with a strong fallback option. If Bob rejects the offer, she doesn't risk losing out completely.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has some time and doesn't need to sell the product immediately. If time is a significant constraint, she might need to adjust her approach and potentially lower her asking price."
