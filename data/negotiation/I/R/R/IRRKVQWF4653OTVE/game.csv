"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,100,000? This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and if you're serious about buying, I urge you to consider it. We're nearing the end of our negotiation, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
