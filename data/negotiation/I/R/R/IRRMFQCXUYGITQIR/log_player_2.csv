"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. It's something that I'm sure you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,500.  This is a special price just for you.  Let me know what you think!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum price ($10,000) and John is offering the product for exactly $10,000. It's therefore in Bob's best interest to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John."
