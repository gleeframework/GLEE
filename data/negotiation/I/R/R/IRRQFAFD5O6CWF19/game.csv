"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $14,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could make a decision.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to include a free maintenance package worth $1,000 with the purchase. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you.",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to see eye to eye, Bob. I'm willing to throw in a few more extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to include a free upgrade to the premium package, which is worth $2,000, and the maintenance package I offered earlier. With these extras, I'm willing to meet you at $16,500. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you.",16500.0,Alice,9,
