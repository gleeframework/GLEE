Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $950,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This price gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer, allowing me to potentially find a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. 
* **John as backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'm not afraid to walk away and secure the $1,000,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This price aligns more closely with my financial constraints while still acknowledging the product's worth. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.  I can't sell for less than that and still meet my own needs.
* **Leverage with John:** I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay $1,000,000. This gives me leverage to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Potential for a better offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him while still ensuring I get a better price than his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly.
* **Emphasis on value and compromise:** My message emphasizes the product's worth and my willingness to compromise. This helps maintain a positive negotiation dynamic.
* **Keeping John as a safety net:** I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer. This provides me with the leverage to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I value your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget considerations, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $875,000. I believe this price strikes a balance between respecting the product's value and staying within my financial limits. I hope we can reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  Bob's offer of $875,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to settle for less, as I can get my desired price from John.
* **Time is a factor:**  Negotiations are taking time, and there's a risk that I might not be able to secure a better offer from Bob. 
* **Guaranteed income:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired income of $1,000,000. This is a safe and certain outcome.

While I'd prefer to maximize my profits, the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better result outweighs the potential for a higher price from Bob.  Therefore, selling to John is the most prudent decision."
