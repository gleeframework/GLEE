"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true worth. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value you truly see in this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty, but $1,000,000 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value you see in this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
