Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John, my goal is to maximize profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a good starting point.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product slightly below my minimum ($1,500,000) provides room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high anchors the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob rejects the initial price, it sets the stage for a potentially more profitable counter-offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value while still leaving me with a substantial profit margin."
