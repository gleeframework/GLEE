"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
