"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down in her offer, but it's still above our ideal price and what John is offering. We have room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?"",
""product_price"": 8250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We split the difference between her last offer ($8,500) and our previous counteroffer ($8,000).  This shows Alice we are willing to compromise but also sets a firm target close to our ideal price."
