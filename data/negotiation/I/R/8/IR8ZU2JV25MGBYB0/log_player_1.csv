Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This price reflects the significant value and quality of the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a relatively high price ($20,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value and quality, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, but still sets a strong starting point. 

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point. The optimal strategy will depend on factors I don't know, like the perceived value of the product to Bob and the urgency of selling it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $15000 for the product, considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $15,000 is at my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Room for Improvement:**  There's little chance of getting a higher price from Bob, as he clearly indicated his budget. 
* **Selling to John:**  While I could sell to John for the same amount, there's no benefit to doing so over accepting Bob's offer. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice, securing the minimum desired price without risking further negotiation."
