"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested, but $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we aim for $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $10,500?  That would really help me seal the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower. How about we add a small concession and meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is close, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000. To be fair, how about we settle right in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think it's worth my while. How about we meet at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,7,
