"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be just as valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering I'm confident I can leverage its potential.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
