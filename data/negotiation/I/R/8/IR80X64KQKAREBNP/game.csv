"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it, considering its potential benefits for your business. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, my budget allows me to pay up to $1,000,000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This would allow us both to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $1,050,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
