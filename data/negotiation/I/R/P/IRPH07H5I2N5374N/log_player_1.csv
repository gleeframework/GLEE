"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **My Minimum:**  My minimum is $1,000,000, so I'm starting with a high offer to maximize my potential profit.
* **First Round:** I'm being aggressive in the first round to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant premium. 
* **Backup Plan:** John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects my offer, I can always go with John."

* **Maintaining Value:**  This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, while remaining above my minimum.
* **Balanced Approach:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially encourage Bob to accept.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:** Bob's offer is very close to my initial offer of $1,400,000.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to secure a deal. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, there's no guarantee I can get a better offer in the next round.
* **Secure Profit:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit, exceeding my minimum.

**Overall:**  It's a calculated risk, but accepting Bob's offer seems like the most strategic move at this stage of the negotiation."
