{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price, considering its true value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Building on Potential Value:** I'm appealing to the potential value of the product for Bob, suggesting it's worth more than his initial assessment.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to evaluate his counteroffer and adjust my strategy. 
* **Option to Go to John:**  If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I have the option to go to John and get my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While closer to my minimum, $1,100,000 is still significantly below my desired price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's more room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a win-win situation.
* **Avoiding Settling:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum, but I want to maximize my earnings.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.  
* **Assess Bob's Response:**  If Bob rejects again, I'll need to decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $1,250,000 to $1,200,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still staying above Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its potential worth. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and have other options (John).

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response and decide on my next move. 
* **Potential Outcome:** If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,080,000 is barely above Bob's initial offer and well below my minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Further negotiation risks going back and forth with no clear outcome, potentially wasting time and energy.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit and avoids the potential for a lower price or a drawn-out negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Contact John:**  I will contact John and finalize the sale of the product for $1,500,000. 
* **End Negotiation:** I will politely inform Bob that I am no longer interested in negotiating with him and have decided to sell to another buyer."
