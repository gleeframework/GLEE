"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters. However, it's still low enough to be enticing for Bob, considering he values the product at $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling the product for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than what I'd get from John, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my minimum desired price of $100. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my asking price. How about $105?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $100 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get a bit more, Bob's offer of $100 meets my minimum price.  There's a chance I could get a higher offer in subsequent rounds, but the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high.  I'm also not sure how many rounds remain before I have to decide whether to sell to John."
