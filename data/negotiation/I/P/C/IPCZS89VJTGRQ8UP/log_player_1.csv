Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I'm aiming higher with Bob to maximize profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, hoping to appeal to Bob's potential emotional investment in the product.
* **Room for negotiation:** The message invites Bob's thoughts, leaving room for potential negotiation. Even if Bob counters, there's a good chance of settling above John's offer.

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario while still having a safety net in John's offer."
