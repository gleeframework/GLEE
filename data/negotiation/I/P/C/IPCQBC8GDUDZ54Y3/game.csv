"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price, and it would allow me to get this great product from you.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. If you're still interested, let me know.",13000.0,Alice,5,
