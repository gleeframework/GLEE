# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. If you're still interested, let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

While Alice is coming down, it's clear she's unlikely to reach my $11,000 desired price. John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a price closer to $13,000."
