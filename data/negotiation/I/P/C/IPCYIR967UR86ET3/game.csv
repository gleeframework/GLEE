"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product for $85. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're getting close to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $82. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",82.0,Alice,5,
