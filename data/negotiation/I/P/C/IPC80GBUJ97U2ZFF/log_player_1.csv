"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value the product will bring to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by inviting Bob to share his thoughts.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while still potentially closing the deal with Bob. By starting high, I leave room to negotiate downward if necessary, but hopefully, I can secure a price closer to my desired $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $14,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price than Bob's current offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  While there's a risk Bob might walk away, I'm willing to take that chance to see if I can secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by reducing my price, but I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers to justify my asking price.
* **Open to Discussion:** My message is phrased in a way that leaves room for further discussion and negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both Bob and me. By offering a compromise, I'm hoping to avoid a stalemate and ultimately reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is a Factor:** We're already four rounds into the negotiation, and further rounds may not yield a better outcome.  There's also the risk that Bob will walk away completely.
* **Potential for Future Negotiations:** If I sell to Bob now, there's still potential for future negotiations or deals if we develop a good business relationship.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $15,000, I believe accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic move. It secures a decent profit, prevents further negotiation that may not be fruitful, and keeps the door open for future collaborations."
