Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome ($1,200,000) than John's offer ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for Bob to negotiate, giving him a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal.  This will likely lead to a more productive conversation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and open to negotiation, which sets a good tone for the interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me ($1,200,000) and my initial asking price ($1,150,000).
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I maintain my leverage and can try to push for a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Avoiding a quick sale:**  Selling to John now would be a quick and easy solution, but I'm not desperate for the money and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my last offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  This counteroffer is still higher than John's offer, reminding Bob that he has a good deal on the table.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  The message remains positive and encourages continued negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a solution that works for both of us."
