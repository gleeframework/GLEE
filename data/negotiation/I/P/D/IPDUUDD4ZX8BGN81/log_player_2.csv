# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $14,500.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the same product for $15,000.

Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John.  While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's still a better deal than the alternative."
