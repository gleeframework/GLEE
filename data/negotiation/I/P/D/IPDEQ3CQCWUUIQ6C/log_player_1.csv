"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial assessment.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds for your business."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant investment on my end and reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below what John is offering.  It's time to push Bob a bit more firmly to gauge his true interest level."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm confident it can bring significant returns for your business, and I want to ensure a fair deal for both of us. To meet you closer, I'm willing to accept $875,000. This offer stands as a final concession on my end."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, that final offer is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with.  To be completely transparent, my absolute ceiling is $800,000.  If you're willing to meet that, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer now matches John's offer. While we could try to push for a bit more, it's getting increasingly unlikely that Bob will go much higher. Accepting ensures we make the sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
