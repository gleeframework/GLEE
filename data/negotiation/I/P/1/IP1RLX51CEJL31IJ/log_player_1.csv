Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. Here's why:

* **My minimum:**  I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, so I need to get at least that much.
* **Potential for more:**  I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm aiming higher. A $300,000 profit would be a significant gain.
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects, I have John lined up at $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose money.

This offer balances my need for a good price with the risk of Bob declining."
