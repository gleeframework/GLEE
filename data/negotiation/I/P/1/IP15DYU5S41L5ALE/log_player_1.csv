Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. 
* This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so this offer gives him a good deal while still allowing me to maximize my profit. 
* By starting high, I can leverage Bob's strong interest in the product and potentially secure a favorable price. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'm ready to counter-offer or accept his counter-offer depending on the situation. 
* However, if negotiations stall or become too lengthy, I always have the option to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,200,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't reflect the product's true value to him.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I believe there is still room to negotiate a better price.  
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I am not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to walk away if necessary. This can potentially push Bob to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000. I will continue to assess the situation and be ready to either accept a counteroffer from Bob or sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm taking a more moderate approach in this counteroffer, as I want to avoid alienating Bob completely. 
* **Bridging the gap:** By lowering my price to $1,300,000, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin. This should hopefully encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **Remaining flexible:** I am still ready to negotiate further if necessary. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will consider his next offer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will carefully evaluate his next proposal. If it's too low, I will consider making another counteroffer or ultimately selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price and significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob.
* **Negotiations stalled:** Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet my price expectations. 
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks prolonging the process and potentially leading to a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed sale:** Selling to John guarantees me a substantial profit of $1,000,000, which is a secure and acceptable outcome.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer a higher price, it's more strategic to sell the product to John at this point.  This ensures I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who has shown a reluctance to pay a fair price."
