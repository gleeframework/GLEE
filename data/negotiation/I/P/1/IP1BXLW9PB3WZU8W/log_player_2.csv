"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a valuable item, and I believe it's worth the price. However, if you're not interested, I'm confident I can sell it to another buyer for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice is trying to trick you into overpaying! She's saying she can get $10,000 from someone else, but that doesn't matter to you. You have a better option.
