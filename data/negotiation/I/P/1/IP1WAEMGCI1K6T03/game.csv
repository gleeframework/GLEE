"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's try to find some middle ground - how about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price. While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.",10000.0,Bob,4,
