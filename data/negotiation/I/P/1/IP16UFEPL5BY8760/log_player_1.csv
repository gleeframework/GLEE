Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your discerning taste.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll recognize its worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive"" and ""unique"" nature, aiming to increase its perceived value in Bob's mind.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,500,000 sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price significantly higher than your fallback option. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject a price perceived as too high. However, the potential gain from his acceptance outweighs the risk of losing him as a buyer. You can always negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer."
