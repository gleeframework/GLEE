You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering $14,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $13,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750

Alice is now offering $13,750, which is still a good deal for you, and you're saving $1,250 compared to John's offer. It's worth accepting at this point."
