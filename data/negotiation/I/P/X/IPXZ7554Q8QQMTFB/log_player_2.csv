"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal. Bob can counteroffer at a lower price and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'd prefer my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and it's only $50,000 higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate might get a slightly better price, but it risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's within his budget and saves him a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
