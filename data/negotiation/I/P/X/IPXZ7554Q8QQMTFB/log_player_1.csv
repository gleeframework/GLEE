Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  This leaves room for negotiation and makes the deal attractive to him.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is straightforward, and the price is stated explicitly. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price or message based on Bob's response. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is a good price, it's still below what you'd ideally like to get.  You're within the negotiation zone, and there's still potential to earn more. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer of $1,400,000.  

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider a price slightly lower than your original offer but higher than Bob's offer.  For example, you could offer $1,350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'd prefer my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** It's a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Maintain leverage:** It's still higher than Bob's offer, suggesting you're not desperate to sell.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages negotiation. 

By offering $1,350,000, you're increasing the chances of reaching an agreement with Bob while still maximizing your potential earnings."
