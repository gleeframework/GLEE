"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us - a significant saving for you, and a fair profit for me. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price that still gives you a decent profit.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about $11,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,000? It's a bit more than your last offer, but it's still a good price for you, and it keeps me from having to sell to John at a lower price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
