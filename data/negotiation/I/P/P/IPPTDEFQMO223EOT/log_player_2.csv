Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,000? It's a bit more than your last offer, but it's still a good price for you, and it keeps me from having to sell to John at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's also signaled that she has a lower limit.  $12,000 is a good compromise, saving you $3,000 from John's price and a reasonable compromise from your initial offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks souring the deal."
