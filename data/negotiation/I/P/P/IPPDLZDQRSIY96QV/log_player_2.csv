It's always best to try and negotiate a better price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to start with a counteroffer of $800,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, and it shows that I'm serious about negotiating.  We'll see if she's willing to come down that far."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price for the product. It's within my budget and a decent amount saved compared to buying from John. I'm going to accept her offer and close the deal."
