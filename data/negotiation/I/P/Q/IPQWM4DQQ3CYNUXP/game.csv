"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to offer $800000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession.
