Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
