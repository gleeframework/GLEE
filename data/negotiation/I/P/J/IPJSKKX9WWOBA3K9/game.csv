"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's aim for $1,100,000. This price still allows you to make a good profit while being closer to my desired value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm still finding it a little high.  Would you consider $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 isn't quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
