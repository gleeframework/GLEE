Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would still be a worthwhile purchase for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
