"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I have another buyer waiting in the wings. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,550,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,475,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1475000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,475,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,525,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my other buyer's offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,525,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,520,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to consider buying from John if we can't come to an agreement.",1520000.0,Bob,6,
