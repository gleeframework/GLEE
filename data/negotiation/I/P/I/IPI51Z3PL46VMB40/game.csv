"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than my desired price, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm confident this product is worth more than $800,000. Let's split the difference - how about $950,000? This still gives you a good deal while allowing me to receive a reasonable price. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $875,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $900,000. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident that it will be worth the investment for you.  Let's meet in the middle once more at $900,000, and we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
