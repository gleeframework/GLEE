{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by proposing a price higher than the minimum value for both parties. It also provides a justification for the price, making the offer more appealing.  By leaving room for negotiation, it encourages Bob to respond and potentially make a counter-offer.  This approach allows for a dynamic negotiation while ensuring that I secure a profit above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  While I am interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to compromise below my minimum price point. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than my desired price, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm confident this product is worth more than $800,000. Let's split the difference - how about $950,000? This still gives you a good deal while allowing me to receive a reasonable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $875,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below it. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and try to push the price higher."
