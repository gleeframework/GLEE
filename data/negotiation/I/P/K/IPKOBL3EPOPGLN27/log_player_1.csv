"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find this price attractive given its value to him, and I can potentially increase the price further if he accepts my offer quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price than $8,000, it's still lower than my initial offer.  I believe I can get a higher price if I continue negotiating.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $9,750. This is a slight increase from his offer, but still significantly lower than my initial offer.  It demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount. I believe this offer is fair and will be attractive to Bob, especially with several rounds left to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still rejecting it. $9,250 is closer to my minimum price of $8,000, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000. With 6 rounds remaining, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $12,000, and I have room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $9,500. This is a slight increase from his last offer, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my desired range.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product, and I'm confident that he will accept this offer, as we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not where I want to be. I have four rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $9,250. This is a slight increase from his last offer, but still significantly higher than my minimum price. I believe that this is a fair price, given that we're nearing the end of the negotiation and Bob clearly values the product at $12,000.  I'm confident that he'll accept this offer in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to sell it for a higher price, we're down to the last two rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $8,800 is still a good price, significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000, and  I'm confident I can still secure a better deal than selling to John."
