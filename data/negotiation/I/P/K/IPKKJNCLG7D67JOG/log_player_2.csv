"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's looking to get the product for under $12,000 and Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $11,000?  I think that's a fair price considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
