"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to consider $1,400,000. This seems like a fair price considering the value of the product. ",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I still believe it's a bit lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,300,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price that will work for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is closer to my range, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us and allows for a reasonable profit margin. ",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. My revised offer is $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal at this price.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm trying to be fair here. $1,320,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get it down a bit.  How about $1,330,000? It's a small difference, and I think it makes sense for both of us. ",1330000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to budge much further from my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final concession, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
