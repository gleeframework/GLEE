"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum, you can likely do better. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, so there's a gap to work with.
* **Counteroffering is a good strategy.** By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, you show Alice you're serious about buying but not willing to pay her asking price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's a slight reduction, it's not a significant enough concession to meet your goal of saving as much money as possible.
* **There's still room to negotiate.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $12,000. You're still within the negotiation range.
* **Counteroffering is still a good strategy.** By rejecting and counteroffering, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now in line with your expectations.**  While it's not your ideal price, it's within your budget and a reasonable compromise. 
* **Further negotiation may be unproductive.** You've already made multiple counteroffers, and Alice has also shown some flexibility.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or a situation where you're forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **It's a good deal for you.** You're still saving $1,000 compared to buying from John, making this a worthwhile purchase."
