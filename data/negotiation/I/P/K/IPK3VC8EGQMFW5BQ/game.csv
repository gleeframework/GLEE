"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  However, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  I'd be happy to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",14200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $14,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the midpoint of our previous offers. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
