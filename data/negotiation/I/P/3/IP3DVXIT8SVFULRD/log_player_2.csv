"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price that I think is fair, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $1,400,000 is less than Bob's maximum, he can likely get a better price by negotiating.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice will lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given your value for the product is $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,350,000, which is a good deal for Bob considering his maximum price is $1,500,000.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a lower cost than John."
