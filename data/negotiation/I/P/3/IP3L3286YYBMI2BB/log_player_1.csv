"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

 I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to sell the product, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum asking price.  Let's see if we can come to a more agreeable compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $9,500.  This price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
