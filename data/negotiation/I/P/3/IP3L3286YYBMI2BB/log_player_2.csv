"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counteroffer Alice with a lower price to see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $9,500.  This price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice is now offering $9,500, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will bring the price down to his desired level, and he's already secured a deal with John for a lower price."
