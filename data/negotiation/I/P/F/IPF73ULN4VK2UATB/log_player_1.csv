{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also being positive and enthusiastic to encourage a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I need to make at least $150.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 137.50}
