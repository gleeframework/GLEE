You have three options:

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5.

Alice's offer is still too high. At this point, it's better to buy from John for a guaranteed $100.  The negotiation is taking too long, and further rounds may result in a price closer to $150 which is still above my maximum."
