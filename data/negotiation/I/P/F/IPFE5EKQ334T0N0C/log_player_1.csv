"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and gauge his potential budget.  If he rejects, it's important to get a sense of how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  This will help me gauge if Bob is serious about getting the product or just trying to get it at a bargain price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $950,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. He seems willing to pay more than $800,000, and I want to see if I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $900,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm also aware that I'm running out of rounds. I need to make a decision soon on whether to accept Bob's offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $875,000.  We've been going back and forth, and I don't think I'll be able to get much higher.  I'm running out of rounds, and while I would have preferred a higher price, this is a decent outcome considering I have a guaranteed alternative with John."
