I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can secure a good price quickly."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal with more negotiation, especially given Bob's willingness to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to compromise, but still maintaining a price that's higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for improvement and I'm not desperate to sell.  I want to see if Bob is truly willing to meet me halfway."

{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm sticking with a counteroffer strategy. My offer is now closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that this demonstrates my flexibility while still keeping a decent profit margin."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum acceptable price, I'm starting to run out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's also possible that Bob won't budge further, making this the best I can get."
