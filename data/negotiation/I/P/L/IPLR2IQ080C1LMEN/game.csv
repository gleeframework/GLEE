"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $900,000 for it. Let me know if this is within your range.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  To be fair to both of us, I could meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel that the product should be valued at less than $900,000. Could we possibly settle on $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
