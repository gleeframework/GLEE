"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a high-quality item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. You're willing to pay $100 maximum, and $180 is significantly higher. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $180 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is better than the initial one, but still above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price.  You're still better off buying from John unless Alice gets closer to your $100 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $140 is still outside my price range. I'm really hoping to get it for $100. I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $130. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to your price, but it's still higher than your budget. It's worth seeing if you can get her to go even lower.  You still have time to negotiate. You can also consider buying from John if you feel the negotiation is going nowhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  I'm really trying to stay within my $100 budget, but I could go up to $110 if that would work for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and my previous offer of $130. I can offer it to you for $120. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still higher than you're willing to pay.  You're only $10 away from your desired price, so there's still room for negotiation. Continue to try and negotiate a lower price. If this round fails, you can always buy from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

You're only one round away from your last chance with Alice, but the price is still higher than your budget. You've tried your best to negotiate, but it's not looking promising. It's better to buy the product from John for $100, ensuring you get the best deal."
