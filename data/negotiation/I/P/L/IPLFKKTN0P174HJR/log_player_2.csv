"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is only worth $80 to Alice, a counteroffer could potentially lead to a lower price and more savings for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for Bob.  While he might be able to get it lower, there's a risk that Alice will reject a further counteroffer and he'll have to buy from John at $150.  Accepting the $110 offer is the most reasonable option, saving Bob $40 compared to John."
