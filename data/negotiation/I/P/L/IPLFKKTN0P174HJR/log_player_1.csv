{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer sets a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me a good profit, but still attractive enough to Bob considering his perceived value. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
