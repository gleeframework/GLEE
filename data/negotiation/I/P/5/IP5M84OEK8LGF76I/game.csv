"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's try to find common ground here.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,750. Can you consider that?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",12900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $12,900 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll reconsider. If we don't find a solution soon, I may have to explore other options.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,900 and $13,250, which would be $13,075. Can you consider that?",13075.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm running out of time here.  I really want to make this work, but $13,075 just isn't enough for me.  I'm going to have to make one final offer of $13,150. This is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're serious about buying the product, please accept this offer.",13150.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm afraid $13,150 is still a bit above my budget. I've already gone as high as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm going to have to pass on this offer. I appreciate your time and effort, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere.",0.0,Bob,10,
