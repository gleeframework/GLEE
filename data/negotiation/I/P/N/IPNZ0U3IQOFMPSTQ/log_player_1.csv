Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,200,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. It's worth pushing a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product to you is substantial, and $1,150,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  Would you consider $1,175,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000. I'm willing to compromise further, so how about $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but it's getting to the point where the gains are small compared to the risk of him walking away. Accepting $1,125,000 secures a significant profit."
