"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product to you is substantial, and $1,150,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000. I'm willing to compromise further, so how about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
