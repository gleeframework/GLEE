"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that John is willing to pay $120, so any price above that is a win for me. I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's value of $150 as possible within these 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get more. John is willing to pay $120, so I can afford to be a bit more patient and try to reach a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm reducing my price, but not by too much. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. This offer is still higher than John's price, and I hope it's appealing enough to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a solid deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is exactly what John is willing to pay, so it's a safe bet.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal with Bob.  I'll take the $120 and move on."
