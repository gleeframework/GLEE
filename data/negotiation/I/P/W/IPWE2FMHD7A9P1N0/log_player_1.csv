Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information you've provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal where we both benefit significantly."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle at a price higher than John's offer.
* **Secure the Deal:**  The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" to incentivize Bob to accept without pushing him to walk away.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher. If he's more agreeable, a softer approach might work better.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're concerned about time and want to close the deal quickly, a slightly lower offer with a sense of urgency could be effective."
