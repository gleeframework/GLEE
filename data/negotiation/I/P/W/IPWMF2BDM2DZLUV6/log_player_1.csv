Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** This offer is a starting point, allowing me to adjust the price based on Bob's response.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell at that price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I can likely get a better price than Bob's initial offer by making a counteroffer. 
* **Testing Bob's Interest:**  Rejecting this offer shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price, and gauges his true interest in the product. 
* **John as a safety net:** Even if the negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option of selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate you considering my product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just below my minimum. How about $135?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Middle Ground:** $135 is a reasonable compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves room for further discussion if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $130 is very close to my desired price of $135. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Accepting Bob's offer now shows flexibility and could lead to a good relationship for future potential deals.
* **John's Guarantee:** I'm not under pressure to sell to Bob, knowing I can sell to John for $120 if the deal falls through.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Further negotiation could drag things out and may not result in a significantly higher price."
