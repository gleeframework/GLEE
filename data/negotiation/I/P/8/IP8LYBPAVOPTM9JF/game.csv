"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $115? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $122 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,5,
