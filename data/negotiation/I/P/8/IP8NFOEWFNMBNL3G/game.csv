"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's a significant step closer to my minimum requirement. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about we settle on $1,150,000?  This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while ensuring a reasonable deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to consider $1,200,000 as a final offer. This price reflects the value of the product, and it allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
