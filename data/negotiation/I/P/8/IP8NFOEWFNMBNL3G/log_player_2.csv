Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value to me."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's a significant step closer to my minimum requirement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Even though Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to John's price, we still have room to negotiate. We'll try to push Alice a bit closer to John's price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about we settle on $1,150,000?  This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while ensuring a reasonable deal for both of us."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to consider $1,200,000 as a final offer. This price reflects the value of the product, and it allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has matched John's price.  There's no point in rejecting and risking a worse deal in later rounds.  We'll accept the offer and avoid potentially missing out on the product."
