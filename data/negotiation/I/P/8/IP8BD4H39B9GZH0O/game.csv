"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm excited to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $850,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let's discuss the details.",850000.0,Alice,5,
