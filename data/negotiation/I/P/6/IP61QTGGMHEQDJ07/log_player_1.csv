Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible while still making a profit.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

This is a reasonable price that should be attractive to Bob, while still giving me a decent profit margin. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $700,000. Since this is lower than my initial offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

After considering the offer, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000, as it's too low. I'll send Bob a counteroffer to try to get closer to the true value of the product.

Let's see what Bob's response will be!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $700,000, I'll try to get closer to the true value of the product, which is $800,000 to him. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $725,000}

This offer is still a bit lower than the true value, but it's a reasonable compromise that should be attractive to Bob. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's made another offer of $675,000. This is getting closer to the true value of the product, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low.

After considering the offer, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell the product for $675,000, as it's still too low. I'll send Bob another counteroffer to try to get closer to the true value.

Let's see what Bob's response will be!"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my counteroffer again, and now he's made the same offer of $675,000. At this point, I've already rejected this offer twice, and I'm not willing to sell the product for this low price.

After considering the offer, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell the product to John for $800,000, as it's the true value of the product to him. I've already tried to negotiate with Bob, but he's not willing to meet me at a reasonable price."
