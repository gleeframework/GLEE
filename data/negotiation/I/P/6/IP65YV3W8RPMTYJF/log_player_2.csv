"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob should buy from John.  Alice is offering $9,000, which is still more than what Bob is willing to pay, and more than what he can get from John. It's time to move on to a better deal."
