Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), giving me some room for negotiation. 
* **A friendly and encouraging message** shows I'm open to a deal and want to build a positive relationship with Bob. 
* This offer leaves space for potential counteroffers from Bob, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* I also have the backup option of selling to John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $10,000. 
* I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
* It's too early to sell to John. I want to maximize my profit and explore all options with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer closer to Bob's offer:**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:** $9,000 is still above my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm keeping the tone positive, emphasizing a ""fair price"" to encourage further negotiation. 
* **Showing commitment to the deal:** By suggesting a specific price, I'm demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement."
