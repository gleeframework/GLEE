{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a sense that there's room for compromise, which could lead to a faster and more successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum acceptable price, you can still get a better price. You have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  It seems like we are getting closer. How about $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $97 is very close to your ideal price and only slightly lower than your last counteroffer.  Accepting his offer will get you a good deal while avoiding further negotiations."
