"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth $10,000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $11,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has a better option available."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's counteroffer is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has a guaranteed way to get the product for a price he's comfortable with."
