Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (anything less and you're better off with John).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 (he won't pay more than this).
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Since his value is $1,200,000, starting too close to $1,500,000 might make him walk away immediately. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're highlighting exclusivity and the product's value.
* **Strategic Price:**  $1,350,000 gives you a significant profit margin while still being considerably lower than your alternative offer. It leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, making him feel like he's won something. 
* **Confident Tone:**  You're not desperate, you have other options. This confidence can encourage Bob to take the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might outright reject the price, but there's a chance he'll counter with a lower offer.  Your knowledge that John will pay $1,500,000 gives you a strong position in the negotiation."
