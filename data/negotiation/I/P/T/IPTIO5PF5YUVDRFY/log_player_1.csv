"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to what I believe the product is worth.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing negotiations with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000.  It's still a good deal for me,  but it shows I'm willing to negotiate a bit.  This should keep Bob engaged and hopefully lead to a more mutually agreeable price in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. There's still time to reach a mutually agreeable price, and I don't want to settle for less than what I feel the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my desired value. I believe this offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still safeguarding my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm going to reject and see if Bob will go higher in the next round.  I've got a few rounds left and I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, showing I'm flexible. We're getting close to a deal, and I'm confident that with a few more rounds, we can find a price we both agree on."
