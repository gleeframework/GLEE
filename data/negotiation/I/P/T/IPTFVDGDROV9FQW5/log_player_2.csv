It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  While it's below her valuation, it's still $300,000 above your maximum. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."

Alice has lowered her offer to $1,000,000, which is still $200,000 more than my maximum. While it's a move in the right direction, I'm not willing to accept that price yet. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to my target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $950,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise given the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer of $1,050,000 is still $250,000 over my maximum. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Alice, as it's unlikely she'll drop her price any further.  It's time to go with the safe option and buy from John for $800,000."
