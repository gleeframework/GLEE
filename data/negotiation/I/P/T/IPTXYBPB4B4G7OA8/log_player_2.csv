"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It makes more sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance you can get a better deal with Alice, or if not, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within my budget. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. This will hopefully encourage Alice to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I will reject this offer and attempt to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and even if she doesn't, I can always choose to buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round to show that I'm willing to compromise.  $950,000 is still below Alice's offer, but closer to her previous counteroffer. This might encourage her to meet me halfway and finalize a deal."
