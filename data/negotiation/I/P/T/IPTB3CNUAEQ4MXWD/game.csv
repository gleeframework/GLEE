"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to be flexible and come down to $11500. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value of this product. Let's finalize this deal!",11500.0,Alice,5,
