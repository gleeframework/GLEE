Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation as Alice, along with an offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **The Sweet Spot:** There's a potential profit margin of $500,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,000,000) to be made.  You want to capture as much of this as possible.

**Strategy**

You want to start high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal. Going too high risks immediate rejection.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential for a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Not Greedy:**  $1,350,000 is significantly above your minimum, aiming to secure a large portion of the potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""potential return"" subtly justifies the price without explicitly revealing its full worth to Bob.
* **Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of desirability and urgency.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have the security of John's offer, giving you leverage.
* **Relationship:** Consider if a long-term business relationship with Bob is valuable. A slightly lower price might foster this."
