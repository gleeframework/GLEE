Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $7,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its worth $8,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $7,500, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $8,000. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is still a great price for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise considering its worth $8,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, $7,800 is a reasonable compromise and a significant improvement over his previous offer. It's worth closing the deal before risking a further negotiation with Bob that could potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
