"I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective.  While $1,800,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
