"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my valuation of the product at $1500000, I believe we can reach a more equitable deal. Would you consider lowering the price to $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your valuation of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $1075000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
