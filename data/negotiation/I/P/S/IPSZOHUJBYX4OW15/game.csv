"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial price is based on the true worth and potential this product holds.  To move things along, I can adjust my price to $2,000,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'd like to make a serious offer at this price, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
