Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit hesitant to go that high. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my maximum budget for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum. While selling to John is tempting, there's room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial price is based on the true worth and potential this product holds.  To move things along, I can adjust my price to $2,000,000.  This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'd like to make a serious offer at this price, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob has now matched John's offer. There's no point in further negotiation or risking losing both buyers."
