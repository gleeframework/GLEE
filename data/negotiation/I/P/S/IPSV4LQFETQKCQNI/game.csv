"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and value, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $22,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  I could come down to $19,000. This is my final offer.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $19,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, I'm really trying to get closer to $15,000 for it. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This is a significant discount from my original asking price.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,6,
