Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your cost and my need to remain within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
