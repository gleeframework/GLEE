"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking to get $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a range Bob might consider. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone in the message can help keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which is likely to happen."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price and losing the chance for potential future interactions with Bob."
