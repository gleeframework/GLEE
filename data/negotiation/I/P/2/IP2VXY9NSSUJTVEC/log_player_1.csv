Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product and I think it's worth $100 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This is a starting offer that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it is worth to Alice. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still ensuring Alice gets a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is still below my ideal price of $120, it's getting closer.  Considering that John is willing to pay $120, and further negotiation with Bob might lead to more back and forth, accepting Bob's offer is the best option for maximizing my profit in this situation."
