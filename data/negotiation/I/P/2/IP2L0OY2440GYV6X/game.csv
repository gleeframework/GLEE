"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the initial price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the value this product brings justifies a higher figure.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
