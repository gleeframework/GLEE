"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer. While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,750?  That's a very fair compromise.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $11,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'd like to propose a trade: I'll take the product for $10,500 and throw in an additional $250 for some extra services. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,6,
