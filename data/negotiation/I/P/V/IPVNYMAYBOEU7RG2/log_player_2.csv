"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to minimize cost."
