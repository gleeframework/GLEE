"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired sale price. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $12,500.  It's important for me to get a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This is a good compromise, and it allows for a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,
