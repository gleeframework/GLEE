Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  Bob only gets one chance to accept. This gives you some leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation increases your chances of success.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  You're not desperate, and you believe in the product's value.
* **""Exceed your expectations""**: Subtly implies you know it's worth a lot to him.
* **High but Justifiable Price:** Leaves room for Bob to feel like he's winning while maximizing your profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" and mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only other option) encourages a quicker decision."
