Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $150, there's a chance Bob might reject it. By offering it slightly lower, you increase the likelihood of a sale and still make a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a price point that's likely to be attractive to Bob (as it's more than his perceived value of $120) while still being significantly above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a time constraint (""limited time"") can encourage Bob to make a decision quicker, preventing him from potentially finding alternative options."
