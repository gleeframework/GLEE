"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. I also know that John is willing to pay $15,000, so I'm not risking losing too much money if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer than my initial offer. I'm hoping that this will encourage Bob to continue negotiating and come up with a price that's closer to what I'm looking for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I've already made a counteroffer and Bob has rejected it. It's clear he's not willing to come close to my value for the product.  Therefore, I'll sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I get a fair price."
