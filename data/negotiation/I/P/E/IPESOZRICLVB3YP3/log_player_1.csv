"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is still lower than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Building Rapport:** I'm opening with a friendly message to make Bob feel comfortable and more likely to engage in a conversation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting that the product is valuable without revealing too much about my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't exceed $12,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value.** I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, so accepting his offer would be a loss.
* **I have 9 rounds left.**  This gives me plenty of time to negotiate with Bob and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** This provides a safety net and ensures I can always get my minimum value.

**Next steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Compromise Language:** I'm using phrases like ""significant compromise"" to signal flexibility while still maintaining my position. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a positive message that leaves the door open for continued discussions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $13,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is ticking:**  We're already in round 4, and each round brings me closer to potentially selling to John for my desired price.
* **Potential for future negotiations:** Even if I accept this offer, there's still a chance I could negotiate a higher price in future interactions with Bob for other products or services. 

By accepting this offer, I'm securing a good price while leaving open the possibility for further profitable exchanges with Bob in the future."
