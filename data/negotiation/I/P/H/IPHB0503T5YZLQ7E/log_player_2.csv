"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you given your needs. I'm asking for $14,000 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum price of $15,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's a potential for a deal where you both get a better price than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.** If negotiation with Alice fails, you can always buy from John, so you're not taking a huge risk by rejecting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? I think that's a fair price that would be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your position, but  $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.**  $13,500 is less than your maximum of $15,000.
* **It's a reasonable compromise.**  Alice moved closer to your initial offer, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price.
* **Buying from John is still an option, but it's more expensive.** While you could still buy from John, you'd be paying an extra $1,500.

This decision balances saving money with the risk of potentially getting a better price if you continue negotiating."
