"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm not quite ready to commit at that price. Considering the product's potential, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $850000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is still a significant savings compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling apart is higher at this point. Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids potential complications."
