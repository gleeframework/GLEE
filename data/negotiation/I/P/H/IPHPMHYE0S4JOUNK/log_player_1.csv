Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a special price of $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **High but Appealing:** $14,999 is a high price, close to your minimum, but the ""999"" effect can make it seem more appealing and potentially sway Bob. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While not part of the initial prompt's parameters, this offer might lead Bob to counter-offer, giving you further room to negotiate towards your desired outcome. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's maximum willingness to pay. If you had additional information about Bob's financial situation or how badly he needs the product, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
