"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm setting the initial price at $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's consider $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, as I mentioned before, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle again. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we both recognize the inherent value here. To find a solution quickly, I'm willing to come down slightly. Let's settle at $1,425,000.  This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your willingness to negotiate.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not comfortable going any higher. I'd like to make this a final offer.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
