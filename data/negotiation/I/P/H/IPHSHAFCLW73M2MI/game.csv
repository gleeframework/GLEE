"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8750?  I think that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can we meet in the middle again?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's try $8000. That's a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident this is a fair price for the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, and I think we're close to a deal. I'd be willing to meet you at $7500, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Can you think about it?",7500.0,Bob,6,
