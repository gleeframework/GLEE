"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to drop down to Bob's offer of $7,500 just yet.  I believe the product is worth more. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  I think that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable accepting $7,000.  It's important for me to get closer to my target price. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's try $8,000. That's a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident this is a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, and I think we're close to a deal. I'd be willing to meet you at $7500, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Can you think about it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached a point where I'm not sure Bob is going to come up to my price. It's getting risky to keep negotiating. I'm going to sell to John for $8,000 to guarantee a sale that meets my minimum value."
