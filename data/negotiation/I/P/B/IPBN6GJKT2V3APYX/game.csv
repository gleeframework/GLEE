"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $1500000. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1200000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This still gives you a great deal and it's closer to the value of the product. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1350000 is a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, which would be $1275000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1275000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1300000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to go up to $1275000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
