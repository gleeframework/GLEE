"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still within your budget. There's potential to save even more by counteroffering. The goal is to maximize savings, so rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $200,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This initial counteroffer allows for potential negotiation space without being too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,200,000. While I could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk of her becoming unwilling to negotiate further.  Accepting this offer saves $50,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous choice at this point."
