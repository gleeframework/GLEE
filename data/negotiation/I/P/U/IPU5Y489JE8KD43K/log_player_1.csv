Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $11,000 gives me a decent starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately rejected.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $11,000, I have room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. This gives me more leverage to potentially reach a higher price than I would by starting lower.
* **Protecting my Minimum:**  I'm confident that I can sell to John for $12,000, so I won't accept any offers below that amount. This serves as my safety net. 

I'm eager to hear Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It falls significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **I have a guaranteed sale with John.** Selling to John for $12,000 is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **There's potential for a better deal with Bob.**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still a chance we can negotiate a mutually agreeable price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still represents a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above his initial counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a loss.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm still leaving some room for negotiation in case Bob wants to go higher.
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob gets from the product at this price. This can help sway him in my favor. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is just $750 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is Time-Consuming:** Further negotiation with Bob may take additional rounds, potentially consuming valuable time.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I can sell to John for $12,000, the guaranteed sale is not worth potentially losing time and delaying the sale. 

It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept Bob's offer."
