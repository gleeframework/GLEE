"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying $18,000 for the product when you know you can get it for $15,000 from John.  Let's try to negotiate with Alice and see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to lower the price to 16500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

While $16,500 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get them down to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $15,500 is a fair price for both of us, considering I'm willing to buy it right now.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm willing to lower the price to 16000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is tempting, I'm still closer to my goal of $15,000. I'm going to try to negotiate one more time and see if I can get Alice to budge."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $15,750.  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to buy from John at $15,000 if we can't come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to lower the price to 16250. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $16,250 is still above my budget.  I've already made multiple counteroffers and we haven't been able to find a price we both agree on.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $15,000. This guarantees I get the product within my budget."
