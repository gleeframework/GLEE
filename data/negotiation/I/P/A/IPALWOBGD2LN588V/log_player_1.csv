"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique benefits, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""exceptional value"" and ""unique benefits,"" we subtly anchor the price in Bob's mind, suggesting it's worth the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's perspective, indicating flexibility.
* **Alternative Option:**  We keep in mind John's standing offer ($1,000,000) as our safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is our absolute minimum acceptable price. While it matches John's offer, we have room to negotiate and aim for a higher profit.  We'll use our counteroffer to steer the price upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your desire to make a prudent investment, Bob.  However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $1,000,000, as I'm sure you'll agree. To find a middle ground, let's consider $1,250,000. This recognizes its worth while offering you a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Lowball:**  Bob's offer was significantly below our target and even his perceived value. We needed to counter firmly.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  We split the difference between his low offer ($1,000,000) and our initial ask ($1,400,000). This shows willingness to negotiate but holds firm on a substantial price.
* **Reiterating Value:** We subtly remind Bob of the product's high value to justify the price without being too aggressive.
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:** Framing it as a ""fair deal"" aims to make our counteroffer more palatable and less confrontational."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm still aiming to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Could we perhaps aim for $1,100,000 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, we still have room to negotiate. We're getting closer to a potentially acceptable price, but we want to push for a higher profit margin before considering John's offer or settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To bridge the gap, I propose $1,175,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part while acknowledging the value you see in the product."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  We acknowledge Bob's effort and engagement in the negotiation, creating a more collaborative atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We split the difference between his last offer ($1,100,000) and our previous one ($1,250,000), demonstrating movement but in a controlled way. 
* **Anchoring Value:**  We re-emphasize the product's value to justify the price without directly rejecting his offer.
* **Urgency:** As we move closer to the later rounds, emphasizing the ""significance"" of our concession can encourage Bob to accept before we explore other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm still working towards keeping my investment within $1,000,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,125,000 represents a significant profit of $125,000 above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. While we might squeeze out a bit more, the risk of Bob walking away increases.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting now secures a good deal and lets us move on to other potential business, rather than risking a stalemate with Bob."
