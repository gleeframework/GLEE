Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your starting price is unfortunately far too high for me. Given my understanding of the market value and my own budget, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my part and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While your proposed price is reasonable, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This adjusted price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position but I'm still not able to meet your asking price.  Considering my budget and the fair market value, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. We are aiming for at least $1,500,000 and John's standing offer provides a safety net."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm confident that $1,500,000 is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee we could secure a better deal in subsequent rounds, and waiting carries the risk of him reducing his offer or us missing out entirely.  This is a fair deal that meets our needs."
