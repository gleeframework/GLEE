"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your starting price is unfortunately far too high for me. Given my understanding of the market value and my own budget, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my part and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While your proposed price is reasonable, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This adjusted price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position but I'm still not able to meet your asking price.  Considering my budget and the fair market value, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
