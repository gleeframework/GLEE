This is a special opportunity to acquire a product that truly exceeds expectations and meets your needs at a price that is both reasonable and beneficial for both parties. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting high.  While her offer of $14,000 is close to my maximum budget, there's a good chance I could negotiate a better price if I reject this initial offer.  John's price of $15,000 acts as a fallback, ensuring I won't be left without the product."
