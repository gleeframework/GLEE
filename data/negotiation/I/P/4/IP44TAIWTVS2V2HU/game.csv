"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,080,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm still very interested. How about we settle at $1,065,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",1065000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to get a good deal. How about we try $1,090,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident it's worth it. I'm also starting to think about the value of time and the opportunity cost of continuing negotiations.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,070,000. This is a fair offer considering the market and the value this product provides. Let me know if this works for you.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,095,000. This is my final offer. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to the value the product has for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1095000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to make one last move to try and close this deal. If you're willing to come down to $1,080,000, we have an agreement.  Otherwise, I think I'll have to explore other options.",1080000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,090,000. I've already made a significant concession, and I need to get closer to the value the product has for you. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a premium support package, which will add significant value to the product. If you're still not willing to meet me at $1,090,000, I'll have to consider other options.",1090000.0,Alice,9,
