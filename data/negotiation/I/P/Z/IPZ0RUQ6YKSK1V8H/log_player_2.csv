"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $20,000. I believe it offers exceptional value, even at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget. You should definitely reject and counter-propose a much lower price to start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $5,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation while staying within a reasonable range of your $8,000 maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down a bit, but $17,000 is still far too high and outside your budget.  You should continue negotiating and see if she's willing to move closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

This counter-offer shows Alice you're willing to increase your offer, but also sets a firm limit that keeps you within a reasonable distance of your maximum budget. This tactic aims to find a middle ground without exceeding your spending limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. Let's settle at $14,000, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, $14,000 is still significantly more than your alternative option of buying from John for $8,000. You should continue negotiating to see if you can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

This counter-offer makes a smaller jump than previous rounds to indicate you're getting closer to your maximum budget. It also puts you slightly below your $8,000 alternative option, giving Alice a chance to offer a price that's beneficial for both of you."
