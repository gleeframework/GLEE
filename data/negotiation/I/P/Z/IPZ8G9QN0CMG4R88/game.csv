"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $999500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $975000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $960000, but I need to be careful with my finances. Can you consider my revised offer of $960000?",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $960000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $970000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great price for both of us.",970000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise further, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to pay $965000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",965000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $965000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $970000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",970000.0,Alice,7,
