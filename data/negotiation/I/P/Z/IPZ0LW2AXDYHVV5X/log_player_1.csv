Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $13,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the safety net of John who will buy it for $10,000, so we can be a bit bolder in our initial offer to Bob."
