"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,200,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still finding it a bit steep. Would you consider $1,350,000? I feel that's a fair compromise that reflects the value I place on the product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value our ongoing conversation,  $1,350,000 is still below the product's true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000.  This price represents a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
