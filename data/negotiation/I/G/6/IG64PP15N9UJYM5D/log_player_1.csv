Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high gives Bob the option to negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a deal.  
* **Secure a Good Outcome:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, we have a solid backup plan with John at $100, ensuring we don't lose out."
