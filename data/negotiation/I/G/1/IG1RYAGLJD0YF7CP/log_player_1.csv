Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. It also encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  $12,000 is a significant profit for you, especially considering your minimum acceptable price is $15,000.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  By setting a reasonable starting price, you invite Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can still choose to sell to John, ensuring you don't lose out on the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I want to make a sale, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price closer to my desired value. This allows me to continue negotiating without losing the opportunity to sell to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between Bob's initial offer and my desired price. 
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Bob's perspective while also stating my position and encouraging further negotiation.
* **Strategy:** By demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward while still staying close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob by making another counteroffer. My goal is to get as close to my desired price as possible while still considering Bob's budget limitations.  If further negotiations with Bob prove unsuccessful, I will ultimately sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I don't lose out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer of $9,500 and my previous offer of $11,000.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while also demonstrating flexibility.
* **Strategy:** By being willing to compromise and offering a price that is closer to Bob's budget, I aim to increase the likelihood of closing the deal while still securing a profit.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will have to carefully consider my options. I can:

* **Make another counteroffer:**  This could be a final offer before selling to John, perhaps at $10,500 or $10,750.
* **Sell to John:**  If I believe that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a satisfactory price, I will sell the product to John for $15,000 to guarantee a profit."
