"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
