"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit further to demonstrate my commitment to this deal.  I'm offering $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While I'm happy to see your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a little below what I need to make this deal work. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $975,000.  This shows my commitment to closing this deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
