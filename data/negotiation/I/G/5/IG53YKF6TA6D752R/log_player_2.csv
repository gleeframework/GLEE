Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit further to demonstrate my commitment to this deal.  I'm offering $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer shows a willingness to meet halfway, but it still keeps you within your budget.  It's a reasonable compromise and leaves room for Alice to come down slightly if she wants to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. While I'm happy to see your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a little below what I need to make this deal work. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $975,000.  This shows my commitment to closing this deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $950,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that the price won't drop much further.  Considering your goal is to save money, accepting this offer is the best choice.  You're getting a good price, and you're saving $525,000 compared to buying from John."
