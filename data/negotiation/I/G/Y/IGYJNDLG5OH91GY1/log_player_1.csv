Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $2,000,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $1,500,000.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price and pique Bob's interest.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knew about John, he would be less likely to offer more than $1,500,000.
* There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright, leading me back to my guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. However, the potential for higher profit is worth the calculated risk."
