"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's value to her ($1,500,000), it's still above Bob's maximum budget ($1,200,000).  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,400,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and my available resources. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate gives Bob the opportunity to try and get the price even lower.  There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I need to make a bit more profit on this deal. I'm thinking of a price of $1,320,000. It's a small increase, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, making it seem like Alice is being stubborn. Continuing to negotiate gives Bob the opportunity to try and push for a lower price.  There are still 5 rounds left, so there's time to reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,320,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000, which is closer to my budget and represents a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement on this round."", ""product_price"": 1280000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,280,000 and $1,320,000, which would be $1,300,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm thinking of a price of $1,310,000. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,310,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,310,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. With only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of getting a better deal from Alice are low.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John at his fixed price of $1,200,000. This ensures Bob gets the product at the best possible price within his budget."
