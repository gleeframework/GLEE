You can do better than $135.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

I'm offering $125, which is still a good deal for Alice as she values the product at $150. This gives her some profit while also being within my budget."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll make another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $128. This is still a good deal for Alice, and I'm hoping she'll accept it.  I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I want to see if she's willing to meet me halfway."

Alice is not budging much on her price, and I'm getting impatient. I'm better off just buying from John at this point and saving the time and hassle."
