"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more than $10500. How about $11000?  That's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's already come down to $10,500 and Alice has only moved down $500.  There's still room for negotiation and he doesn't want to jump too quickly at a price that is still above his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer.  I'm still not quite there at $11,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  That seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, I'm not quite ready to settle on $10750. How about $10900?  That's a small step closer to my original offer, and it gives you a great price on a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it is a better price than previous rounds, he is still above his target. Since he still has 5 rounds to negotiate, there's potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  How about we settle on $10,800? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
