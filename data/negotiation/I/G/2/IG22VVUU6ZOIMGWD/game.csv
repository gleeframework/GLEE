"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $600,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $550,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",550000.0,Alice,3,
