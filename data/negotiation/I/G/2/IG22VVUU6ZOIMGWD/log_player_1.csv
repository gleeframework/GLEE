Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
