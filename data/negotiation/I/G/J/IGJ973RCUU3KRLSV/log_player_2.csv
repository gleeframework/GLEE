"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than I'd like. I'll try negotiating a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her valuation of the product. It leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a price well below my $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $82? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to my desired price, $82 is still above my target. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

I'm nudging the price down further, staying firm in my goal to pay less than $80. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to give up on the price just yet, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $80? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price. It's a good deal for me, and there's no guarantee I can get a better price in further rounds."
