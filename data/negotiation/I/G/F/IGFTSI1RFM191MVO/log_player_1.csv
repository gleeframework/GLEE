Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high. How about we settle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. We have room to negotiate and time is on our side, so rejecting and countering again keeps the pressure on him while leaving our fallback option open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. How about $1,012,500?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1012500
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Pressure:** By stating this is our final offer, we apply pressure on Bob to accept.  
* **Middle Ground:** This offer splits the difference between his last offer and our previous one, signaling willingness to compromise but holding firm above $1,000,000.
* **Time:** We are over halfway through the rounds. Applying pressure now increases the likelihood of closing the deal with Bob at a favorable price."
