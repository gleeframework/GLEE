Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's a great deal at $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with an offer higher than his valuation leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies a reason for the price (""before I list it publicly"") without revealing your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Potential for Profit:**  This strategy aims to secure a price higher than even your guaranteed sale price to John.  If Bob negotiates down, you can still likely settle for a price above $10,000."
