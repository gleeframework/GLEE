"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm looking for a price around $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $10,000. It's worthwhile to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, so you have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $16,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you consider meeting in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your ideal price. You have 7 rounds left, which allows for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer will let you try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still above what I can comfortably pay.  How about $11,500? This represents a fair compromise and would allow us both to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $11,500.  How about we settle at $12,250? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,250 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price and you have 5 rounds left. You can likely squeeze out a better deal by rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to close the deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,250.  I'm willing to go up to $11,750, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11750}
