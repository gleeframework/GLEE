(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You have a maximum budget of $1,200,000 and Alice's offer is $950,000. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to the alternative option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above your desired price point.
* Offering $850,000 is a reasonable counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* This gives Alice an opportunity to come down in price while also allowing you to save a substantial amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is higher than your initial counteroffer of $850,000, indicating that she is willing to negotiate further.
* You are still aiming to pay less than $950,000. 
*  By rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer, you can potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is still too high, but it shows she is willing to negotiate.
* Offering $900,000 is a compromise, closer to her price but still within your acceptable range.
* This shows a willingness to reach a deal while staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $990,000 is getting closer to your maximum budget of $1,200,000, but it's still too high. 
* The negotiations are getting close to a stalemate. 
* At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John, even at a higher price, as you have already spent a significant amount of time negotiating with Alice. 
* Buying from John guarantees you will get the product and avoid further negotiation fatigue."
