Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You value the product at $100, so $115 is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation process that could potentially lead to a higher price for you. 

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate towards a price that's closer to your ideal outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** While $105 is better than selling to John for $100, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  You can still try to get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can continue the negotiation and potentially reach a price that is more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $105. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $110 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Signal flexibility:**  By lowering your price, you show Bob that you're willing to negotiate. 

This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to meet you halfway while still allowing you to get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly above minimum:** While $102 is only slightly above your minimum of $100, it's still a better deal than selling to John.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Bob has shown he's not willing to go much higher, and further negotiation may risk losing the sale.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and you could lose the sale to another buyer. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice, as it provides a reasonable profit while minimizing risk."
