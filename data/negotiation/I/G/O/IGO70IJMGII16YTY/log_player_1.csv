Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing the negotiation. I'm also keeping John as a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Bob's offer is close to my ideal price and significantly higher than selling to John.  It's worth accepting to ensure the sale."
