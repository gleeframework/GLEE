"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a relatively high price, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob without revealing specifics, piquing his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think."" 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a fruitful negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be high for you, but I believe I can offer you $14000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. This gives me room to counter-offer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I want to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can secure a higher price.  
* **Time to Counter:** I have 9 rounds left and want to use them to try to maximize my earnings.

I'll counter-offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more for this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. It's a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by lowering my price slightly from my initial offer.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the product's worth. 
* **Reiterating Uniqueness:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's special qualities, hoping to encourage him to come closer to my price.

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground and potentially secure a deal that's favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $14200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still below my ideal range.  
* **Time is on My Side:** I have 7 rounds remaining. I can afford to continue negotiating to try to secure a more favorable deal. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Even though I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I have John as a backup, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through.

I'll make a counter-offer, aiming to meet Bob halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $14,300 for the product? It's a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 14300} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  I'm offering a price that's right in the middle of Bob's last offer and my previous offer, showing a commitment to reaching an agreement. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing ""fair price"" and ""happy"" to create a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Time Pressure:**  While I have some time left, I don't want to let the negotiation drag on too long. This offer is a clear signal of my willingness to close the deal.

This counter-offer aims to bring Bob closer to my target price and hopefully lead to a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I am willing to consider $14250 as a fair price for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has clearly stated that his offer of $14,250 is his final offer. This means there's no room for further negotiation.
* **Close to Target:** While not my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Risk of Loss:**  Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to a stalemate. If I keep rejecting, Bob may walk away, and I might be forced to sell to John at a lower price.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a decent price.  It's better to secure a good profit now than risk losing the deal altogether."
