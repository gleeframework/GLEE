Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's a fair price:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** The product is worth $100 to Bob, so he has a potential gain of $5 if he accepts.
* **It allows for counteroffers:** This price provides a buffer for potential counteroffers, giving you room to negotiate.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is still a good deal for Bob as it's below his perceived value of $100. It also shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a little below what I originally hoped for, it's still a decent profit and better than selling to John for $80.  The risk of further negotiation could result in a lower price, or Bob walking away entirely. I'm happy to take the $88 and move on."
