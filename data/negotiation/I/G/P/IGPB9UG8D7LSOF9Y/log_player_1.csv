Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the asking price without explicitly stating it.
* **Alternative Incentive:**  Mentioning listing the product ""publicly"" subtly hints at the possibility of other buyers and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation. 

While I have a fallback option with John, aiming higher with Bob increases the potential profit."
