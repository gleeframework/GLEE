"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I know its value to you is high, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which I believe reflects the product's exceptional quality and potential.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product is truly unique, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value.  Let's compromise - I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're close to an agreement.  While $775,000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $825,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product, while also ensuring we both benefit from this transaction.",825000.0,Alice,5,
