{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to her. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above the product's worth to her. It's a bold move, but I'm hoping to leverage the fact that she's motivated to sell.  If she rejects this, we'll see if she's willing to compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still too high. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if we can get closer to my target price. While buying from John is always an option, I'm determined to get the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to offer Alice the product's worth to her. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping she'll see that it's in her best interest to accept. If she doesn't, I'll still have the option of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,200,000, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity entirely.  Accepting this offer saves me $250,000 compared to John, which is a significant amount."
