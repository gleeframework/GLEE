Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be very valuable for you, but I'm happy to consider a counter offer if you have one."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While the product is only worth $100 to Bob, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appearing Flexible:** Offering to consider a counter-offer makes Bob feel like he has some bargaining power and might increase the chance of a sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $125 price point aims to split the difference between what Bob values the product at and your minimum acceptable price. This increases the likelihood of a sale while still securing a profit above your minimum.

This strategy attempts to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's perspective and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
