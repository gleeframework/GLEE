"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with $2,000,000, we set a high anchor. Even if Bob rejects it outright, his counteroffer is more likely to be in a higher range than if we started lower.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value is key to securing a good price. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* We need to be prepared to negotiate down from our initial offer, but not drop below $1,500,000 (our guaranteed sale price to John).
* Observing Bob's reactions to our offers will give us insights into his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our desired price and the product's value to him ($1,000,000). Accepting would mean a substantial loss. We have room to negotiate and John provides a strong safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This reflects the product's unique value while still offering you a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We've made a significant concession from our initial $2,000,000 offer, signaling flexibility but not desperation.
* **Above the Safety Net:** Our counteroffer remains comfortably above the $1,500,000 we're guaranteed from John. 
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, we aim to nudge Bob closer to his $1,000,000 valuation. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We have seven rounds left, allowing for further adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I understand the product's value is significant, but I need to work within my budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a fair offer considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signals, But Not There Yet:** Bob's message suggests he's willing to move closer to a price that works for us. His acknowledgment of the product's worth and his ""meet in the middle"" proposal indicate potential for a deal above our guaranteed price.
* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Accepting $1,200,000 would still leave a significant gap between what we could get from John and what Bob values the product at. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  With six rounds remaining, we have room for further negotiation.  We'll aim to push Bob closer to his $1,000,000 valuation without jeopardizing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can close this deal. Would you consider $1,400,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Competition:** Introducing a sense of urgency and competition can encourage Bob to make a decision. By mentioning another buyer, we emphasize that our offer is time-sensitive.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting this as our ""final offer,"" we aim to signal that we're firm on the price while still giving Bob a chance to secure the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,400,000 is a strong position. It's significantly above our guaranteed price from John but also a substantial concession from our previous offer, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate. 

This approach aims to either close the deal quickly at a favorable price or prompt Bob to reveal more about his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,400,000 is still pushing my limit.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute best offer.  If we can't agree here, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  Bob has increased his offer to $1,250,000, which is a reasonable gain compared to our guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. 
* **""Best and Final"" Language:**  His statement that this is his ""absolute best offer"" suggests he's unlikely to move significantly higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a solid profit and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiations."
