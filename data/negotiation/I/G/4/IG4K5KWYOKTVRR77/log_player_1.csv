Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000.  I know its value to you far exceeds this price, and I believe this is a fair offer considering its unique nature and potential. Let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim for a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) but still attractive to Bob, who values it at $1,500,000.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers while ensuring a substantial profit margin.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and urging a prompt decision adds a subtle pressure tactic without seeming overly aggressive.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it at my minimum acceptable price."
