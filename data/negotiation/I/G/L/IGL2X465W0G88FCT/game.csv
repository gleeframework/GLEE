"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share the product with me. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,150,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,150,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's worth, I understand the need for us to find a mutually agreeable point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer of $1,125,000. My budget constraints are quite tight, and I am unable to meet that price. I am prepared to offer $1,075,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
