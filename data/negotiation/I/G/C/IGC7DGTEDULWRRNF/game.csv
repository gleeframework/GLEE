"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. My initial price is $175. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit to $140. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product to be well worth it.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $100, which is a good middle ground for us both. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to go down to $125, which is a significant compromise on my part. This offer is still within my acceptable range and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $110. This is a significant step for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $110 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $117.50. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.",117.5,Alice,7,
