"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is significantly higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good deal compared to Alice's value, it's still over your budget.  You have the opportunity to negotiate a better price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $11,000 is still outside of my budget.  I can continue to negotiate and hopefully secure a better price.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows me to keep pushing for a lower price without having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This is a fair price that considers both our perspectives. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,875?  This way we can both come to a fair agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my price, $10,875 is still above my budget. I want to try and push for a price closer to $10,500.  There's still time to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,875 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,625. This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 10625}
