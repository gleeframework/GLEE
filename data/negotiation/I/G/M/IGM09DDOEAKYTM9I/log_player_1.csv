"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but still leaves me with a healthy profit.  I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further to get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}

I'm going to counter with $1,375,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value."

While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to keep negotiating with him, hoping he'll come up a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still within my acceptable range. I believe this might be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer but it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm not sure if I can get a higher price from him.  To avoid further negotiation and to ensure a guaranteed sale, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
