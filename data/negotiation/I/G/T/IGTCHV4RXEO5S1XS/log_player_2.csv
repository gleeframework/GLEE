"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You can potentially save more money by making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $10,000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get the product at a lower price, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You can likely get it for lower than $11,500.  The goal is to save as much as possible, and even a small difference in price is worth pursuing."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like. How about $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm really looking forward to getting this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to try and squeeze out another few hundred dollars, it's important to consider the following:

* **Alice's price is already quite good:**  You're getting the product for $3,750 less than what it's worth to you.
* **Alice has already made a significant concession:** She's lowered the price from $12,000 to $11,250. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you keep rejecting, Alice might walk away, and you'll end up having to buy from John for $15,000.

At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible option. You're getting a good deal and avoiding the risk of losing the product."
