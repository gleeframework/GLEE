"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you a fair offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500, as it's below my initial valuation. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer of $10,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price, possibly closer to his target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my initial valuation, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is closer to Bob's target price than Alice's previous offers, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000, as this is the most financially advantageous option. Further negotiation with Alice might result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it risks prolonging the process. Buying from John ensures a quick and budget-friendly transaction."
