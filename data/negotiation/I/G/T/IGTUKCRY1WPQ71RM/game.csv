"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you a fair offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your initial valuation and within my price range.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500, as it's below my initial valuation. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise considering your initial valuation. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my initial valuation, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9200.0,Alice,5,
