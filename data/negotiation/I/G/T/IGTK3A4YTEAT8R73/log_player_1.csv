"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for me. I believe it's a reasonable starting point, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I can't accept a price below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm reducing my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to both of us."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer again and hope to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Bob's offer is still too low, and with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
