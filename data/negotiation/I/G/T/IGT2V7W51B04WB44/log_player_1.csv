I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000. I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest in the product and gauge his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $15,000 and making a counteroffer of $16,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale to John.  $15,500 is a good price, exceeding my minimum value and providing a decent profit."
