Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it might be worth more than Bob's estimated value. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Hinting at other interested buyers (""listing it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to accept your offer.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your absolute minimum is $12,000."
