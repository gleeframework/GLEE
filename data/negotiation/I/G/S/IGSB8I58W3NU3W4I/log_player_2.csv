"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business.  My initial price is $1200000.  This reflects the value I place on the product, and I'm open to discussing your thoughts and potentially finding a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to you ($1,500,000). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a potential for a significant saving, as Alice's offer is still above her own valuation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $900000 is certainly a good starting point, it doesn't quite capture the full value of this product for you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price remains fair given the significant benefits this product offers your business, and it leaves room for both of us to come out ahead.  Let's continue discussing and find a solution that works for both of us.
