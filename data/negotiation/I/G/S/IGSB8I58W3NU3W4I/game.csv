"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business.  My initial price is $1200000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $900000 is certainly a good starting point, it doesn't quite capture the full value of this product for you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price remains fair given the significant benefits this product offers your business, and it leaves room for both of us to come out ahead.  Let's continue discussing and find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is still too high for me.  To find a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000.  This reflects the value I place on the product, and it allows for a significant saving for both of us.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
