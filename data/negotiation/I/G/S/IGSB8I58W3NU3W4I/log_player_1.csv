Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is certainly a good starting point, it doesn't quite capture the full value of this product for you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price remains fair given the significant benefits this product offers your business, and it leaves room for both of us to come out ahead.  Let's continue discussing and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

This reflects the value I place on the product, and it allows for a significant saving for both of us.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at this price.
