"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $15,500 for it.  This would still leave you with a profit, and it's a price I'm confident we can both agree on.",15500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $16,500.
