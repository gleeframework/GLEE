Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product.  I know it's valuable to you, so I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) creates a strong incentive for him to buy. This approach aims to maximize your profit while still ensuring Bob sees the purchase as beneficial.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you do not know Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. If you had more information about Bob's financial limits, you could adjust your offer upwards."
