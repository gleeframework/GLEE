``` 

It's always good to try to negotiate a lower price.  $75 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $50. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it's still a reasonable offer considering my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65

$65 is still a bit high, I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 

I'm going to offer $60. It's a small step down from Alice's offer, but I'm hoping she'll see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but not as quickly as I'd like. However, we're getting close to my ideal price range. I'm going to accept this offer, as it's the best deal we've seen so far. There's always a chance I could get a lower price, but the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high."
