"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's try a compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $8,500. This price still gives you a good deal, and we can both walk away happy. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about $7,500? That's a fair offer considering my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,500 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - $8,000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to close this deal.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement this time.",8000.0,Alice,5,
