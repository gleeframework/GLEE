Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Please let me know your decision as soon as possible."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we want to start negotiations with Bob significantly above his perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,300,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing our profit if he's eager and willing to bargain. 
* **Justification for the price:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price point. 

By setting a high initial price, we maximize our potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation to secure a deal with Bob. If Bob rejects the offer, we can confidently sell to John at our desired price."
