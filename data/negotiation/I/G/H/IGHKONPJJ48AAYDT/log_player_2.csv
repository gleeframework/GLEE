"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room for negotiation there is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product.  $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good.  While $130 is closer to my budget, I still think there's room to negotiate. Let's see if I can get it closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her price, while still aiming for a price that's beneficial for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $120 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to go a bit lower than my initial price, but how about $125?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is only willing to come down slightly. While I could try to haggle further, $125 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It's unlikely I'll get a much better deal from Alice."
