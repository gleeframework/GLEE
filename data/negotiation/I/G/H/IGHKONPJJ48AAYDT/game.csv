"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product.  $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $120 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to go a bit lower than my initial price, but how about $125?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
