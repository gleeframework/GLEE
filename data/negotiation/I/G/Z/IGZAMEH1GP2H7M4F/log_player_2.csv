"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product from John for $10,000, so Alice's offer is too high.  He should counteroffer Alice with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for it, and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is offering $10,500, which is still more than Bob wants to pay.  He can get the same product from John for $10,000, so that's the best option for him."
