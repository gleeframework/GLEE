"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Selling to John at $8,000 is the same outcome, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option to close the deal."
