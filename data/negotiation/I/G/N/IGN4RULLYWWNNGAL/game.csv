"I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair price considering the value I know this product will bring to you. Let's see if we can make this work.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not convinced that $1750000 is the best deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $1625000 is a more reasonable price for this product. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
