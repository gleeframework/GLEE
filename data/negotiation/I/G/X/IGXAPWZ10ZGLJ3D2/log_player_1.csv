{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **High Profit:**  You're aiming for a profit of $400,000, which is a significant amount.
* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is still lower than the product's value to Bob, giving him an incentive to buy.
* **Minimizes Risk:**  Even if Bob rejects, you still have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000, so you won't lose out. 

By offering this price, you increase your chances of getting a higher price from Bob while also having a safety net in case he doesn't accept."
