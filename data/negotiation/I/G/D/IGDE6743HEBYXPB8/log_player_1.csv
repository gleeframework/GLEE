Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product that's worth much more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping he'll see the value and be willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for me to potentially make some concessions if Bob counters, but still allows me to make a profit above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition, making Bob more likely to engage. 

**Important Note:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in my pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm not desperate to sell and have a safety net in John who is willing to pay my asking price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can likely push Bob closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to Bob at $10,500 would result in a loss for me, as it's below my minimum.  

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $11,500."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better price on a product like this.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $11,500 to $11,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but am still firm on my bottom line.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $11,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired price point. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** The message emphasizes the value proposition and the opportunity for Bob to get a good deal.

**Important Note:** I'm still keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $12,000, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired profit margin.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room to negotiate a price that is closer to my goal.  I'm willing to compromise a little further, but not to the point where I'm losing money.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to Bob at $10,750 would still result in a loss for me, as it's below my minimum.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly higher than $10,750, but still below my initial offer of $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,875?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still getting you a great price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.
* **Small Concession:** The price is only slightly higher than Bob's last offer, making it seem like a small compromise on my part.
* **Final Push:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to seal the deal and avoid having to sell to John, while still ensuring I don't sell below my minimum.

**Important Note:**  I'm aware that I could still sell to John for $12,000, but I'm trying to maximize my profit by finding a compromise with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,750, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Room for More Compromise:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $12,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.
* **Time is Money:**  The back-and-forth negotiations have already taken some time. Selling to John will guarantee me my desired profit quickly.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, John offers the best price and guarantees that I meet my minimum profit requirement. 

**Decision:** Selling to John ensures a quick and secure sale at my minimum profit threshold. While I enjoyed the negotiation process, I've reached a point where maximizing my profit is the priority."
