"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a tactic to see if he's willing to pay more than his initial assessment.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if I can get a higher price right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I think this is a fair compromise given Bob's counteroffer and my need to close the deal.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John, but I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffers are getting lower.  I've already lowered my price to my minimum. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further rounds of potentially decreasing profits."
