Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150) to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $120, so I'm not asking for a ridiculous amount.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate and see if I can find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $150, and it's possible he won't budge further.  It's better to take the $140 and secure the sale than to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing."
