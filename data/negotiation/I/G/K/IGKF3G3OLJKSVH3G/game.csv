"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  The product's potential is significant, and I'm confident it will bring you great returns.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a great deal.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $950,000 is still unfortunately too low for me. Considering the significant value this product holds for your business, I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  Let's aim for a final agreement. This price reflects a meaningful concession on my part, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise given the product's value.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still just a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Considering the potential value this product brings to your business, I believe $990,000 is a fair compromise. This represents a significant reduction from my original asking price, and I'm confident that it's a price you can accept while still securing a valuable asset.  Let's finalize this deal now.",990000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $990,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at this price.",980000.0,Bob,8,
