``` 

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,300,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob has countered with the same amount twice, signaling he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Time Constraint:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away and getting a lower price from John."
