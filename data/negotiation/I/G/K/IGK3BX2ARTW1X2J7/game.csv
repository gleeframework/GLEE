"I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $8,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your time, but we seem to be at an impasse. $9,000 is my best offer at this point. If you're not able to accept it, I'll need to seriously consider my other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
