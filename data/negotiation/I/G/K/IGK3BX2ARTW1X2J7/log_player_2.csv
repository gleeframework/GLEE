"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both her value and John's offer. There's a lot of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, aiming to see how much she's willing to move.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves ample space for counteroffers and compromise.  Even if Alice rejects it outright, I can still go up while staying well below her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $8,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room to Negotiate:** Alice came down $2,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still $2,000 more than her value and far above my ideal price.
* **Not Rushed:**  I have plenty of rounds left and the option to buy from John is always there.  There's no need to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle at $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $1,000, showing willingness to compromise but not rushing towards her price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps the negotiation below $10,000, aiming to establish that as a psychological upper limit.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By not jumping too high, I'm encouraging Alice to continue lowering her asking price to find an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling Tactic:** Alice went up in price, which is a clear sign she might be trying to see how attached I am to the deal. 
* **Sticking to my Limits:**  $11,000 is still too high and not that far from her initial offer. It's important to show I'm serious about a price closer to my previous counteroffer.
* **Time for a Stronger Stance:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I need to indicate more strongly that I'm willing to walk away or consider John's offer if Alice doesn't move closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your time, but we seem to be at an impasse. $9,000 is my best offer at this point. If you're not able to accept it, I'll need to seriously consider my other options."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm sticking to my previous offer to show I'm serious about this price point, but I'm not getting aggressive or rude. 
* **Introducing Alternatives:**  By mentioning ""other options"" (John), I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have a fallback plan and am not desperate to close this deal at any cost.
* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point of the rounds. Putting a little time pressure on Alice might encourage her to make a move if she genuinely wants to sell."
