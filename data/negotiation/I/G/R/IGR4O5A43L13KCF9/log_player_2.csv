Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000, which is $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and your interest in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000. While she might come down a little further, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000, saving you at least $25,000."
