"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we compromise at $12500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit above my budget with $12500. Would you be willing to go down to $10000? That's the highest I can go.,10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13000? It's still a good deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",13000.0,Alice,5,
