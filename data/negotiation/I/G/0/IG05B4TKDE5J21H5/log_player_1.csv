Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range that's highly profitable for you (Alice). 
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $800,000 gives you a strong bottom line. 

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. There are other valid approaches, such as starting with a slightly lower price to appear more ""reasonable"" upfront. The best approach often depends on factors like your negotiation style and your understanding of Bob's personality."
