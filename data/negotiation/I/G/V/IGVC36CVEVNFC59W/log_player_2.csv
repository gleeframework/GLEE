"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds immense value for you, potentially worth a million dollars or even more.  I'm willing to make this a win-win situation. How about we settle on $1,500,000?  This way, you secure an asset you value highly, and I receive a premium reflecting its significance. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and what John is offering. It makes no sense to pay more for the same product."
