Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** This is the absolute minimum you'll accept for the product ($1,200,000).  John guarantees you this price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This is the range where a deal can happen, between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your reservation price, you have strong leverage. You want to aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential for a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're positioning the product as exclusive and highly valuable.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,100,000 is below your reservation price but well above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Value-Focused Language:**  You're emphasizing ""worth"" and ""return on investment"" to frame the price positively.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower initial offer.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate!"
