"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $1,200,000.
