"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $8000 was a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we try $8500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the best I can do.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price a bit higher.  How about we settle on $8750? That's a fair price for both of us, and it'll ensure a smooth transaction.  What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still looking for a bit more profit, but I'm getting close to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8600, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8600.0,Bob,6,
