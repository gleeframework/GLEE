"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm hoping for something closer to $15000. How about we meet in the middle at $14000?  Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far from $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. How about we try $13500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit far off from my target price.  Let's compromise at $14000.  It's only a small difference from your last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
