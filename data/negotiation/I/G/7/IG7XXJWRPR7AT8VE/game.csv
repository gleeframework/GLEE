"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still offers you a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there with $900,000. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Bob,4,
