,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. This reflects the fair market value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
