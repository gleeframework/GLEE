{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's common practice in negotiation to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable offer. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it seem like you have more wiggle room.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Openness:** By mentioning being ""open to negotiation,"" I signal that I'm willing to compromise, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and keep the $8,000 minimum in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob is showing interest, there's a possibility of getting closer to my desired price with further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $8,000 gives me a solid fallback option if negotiations with Bob fall through.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount. It's important to be firm but also flexible to reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer is a Compromise:** $8,500 is a middle ground between my minimum of $8,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still valuing the product.
* **Reiterating Value:** Highlighting the ""good deal"" for both of us reinforces the value of the product. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  Continuing a friendly and collaborative tone can encourage Bob to make a final counteroffer or accept my offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll continue to monitor Bob's responses and be prepared to adjust my counteroffers if necessary.  My goal is to secure a price as close to my desired $8,000 as possible. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7000 and $8500. How about $7750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my $8,000 threshold.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's still some room for negotiation, and I believe I can secure a higher price. 
* **John is a Safe Option:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives me a solid alternative if negotiations with Bob don't go my way.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $8,000. I'll need to carefully consider my next offer to see if I can get Bob to agree or if it's better to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $7,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm ready to make a final compromise.  How about $8,250? This is really my best offer, but I'm confident it's a price that will make us both happy."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  $8,250 is a fair compromise that's closer to my desired price of $8,000 but still lower than my previous offer.  This shows I'm flexible but not willing to go too much further. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** I highlight ""both happy"" to remind Bob that a deal at this price is beneficial for both of us.
* **Setting a Deadline:** Stating it's my ""best offer"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $8,000. This is my final counteroffer to Bob, as further negotiation risks losing the deal and earning less than my minimum goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $7500, and I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:**  $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:**  I've already made multiple compromises, and there's no indication Bob is willing to increase his offer significantly.
* **John Offers a Safe Alternative:**  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Decision:** 

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  Selling to John is the most sensible decision in this situation, as it guarantees a fair price and eliminates the risk of a deal falling through with Bob."
