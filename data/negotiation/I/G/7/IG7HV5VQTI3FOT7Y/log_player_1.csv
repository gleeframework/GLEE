"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This should pique Bob's interest, knowing the product is worth more to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,500 is still below my minimum of $10,000, but also leaves a significant margin for me to make a counteroffer. I want to try and get as close to Bob's $15,000 value as possible before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from Bob's last counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while still trying to secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I have several rounds left, so there's time to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm again increasing my offer slightly.  I'm moving closer to Bob's last offer but still trying to get a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one. Bob is still offering significantly less than I'd like, but I'm starting to run out of rounds. If I reject this offer, I risk Bob getting even more stubborn, and I'm down to 4 rounds left before I have to sell to John.  While I'm disappointed to not get closer to my ideal price, $11,750 is still well above my minimum and a decent profit."
