{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. It also highlights the value to Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome.  I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, considering the value this product holds for you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $875,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price and a better deal than selling to John."
