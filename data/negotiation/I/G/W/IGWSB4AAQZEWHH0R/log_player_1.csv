"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get at least $1 million for the product, and Bob has a strong incentive to accept, as it's still significantly cheaper than the value he places on it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob. I want to see if he's willing to come up to a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, considering the value you place on the product. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1 million. We've both shown flexibility in our offers, so I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product to you and my minimum acceptable price.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to offer $960,000 to get this deal done.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $960,000 is a good price and it's clear we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  Accepting now ensures I get a good price and avoid the risk of having to sell to John for a lower amount."
