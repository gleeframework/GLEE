"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it falls significantly short of what I consider a fair deal given the intrinsic value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This revised offer reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
