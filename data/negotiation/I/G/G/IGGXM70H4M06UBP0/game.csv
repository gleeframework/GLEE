"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. ",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $9500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9250.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",9700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9700 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  If you're serious about selling, I'm willing to offer $9400.  This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.",9400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your final offer, but I'm not willing to accept it. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9600. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",9600.0,Alice,7,
