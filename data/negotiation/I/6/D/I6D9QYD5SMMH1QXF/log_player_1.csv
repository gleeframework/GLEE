Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $1400000. However, I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it allows for both of us to come out ahead in this transaction.  Let me know if you're open to this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
