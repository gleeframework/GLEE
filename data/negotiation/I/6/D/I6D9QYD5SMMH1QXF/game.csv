"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $1400000. However, I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it allows for both of us to come out ahead in this transaction.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This still gives you a great deal and allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
