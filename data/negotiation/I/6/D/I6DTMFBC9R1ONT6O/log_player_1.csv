Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **My Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to me, so I want to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **John's Value:**  I have a backup buyer in John, who will pay $10,000. This gives me a safety net if Bob rejects my offer.
* **Negotiation:**  By offering $14,000, I'm leaving some room for negotiation. If Bob is willing to pay a bit more, we could potentially split the difference. If not, I'm still guaranteed $10,000 from John."
