"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's always best to try and negotiate a better price before considering the alternative option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** A $3,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is significant but not unreasonable.  
* **Sets the Tone:**  This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying but not willing to overpay.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  You can still increase your offer in later rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. Is this a more comfortable price for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, you can still potentially do better. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your desired price point of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  I'm very serious about buying this product and believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Incremental Move:**  A $250 drop from Alice's offer shows you're willing to negotiate, but not willing to overpay.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  The ""split the difference"" language suggests you're trying to reach a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Reiterating Serious Interest:**  The reminder about your serious interest in buying creates a sense of urgency for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! However, I was thinking that $10,250 is still a bit low for me. I can do $10,750, which is a compromise between our last two offers. Is this a price you'd be willing to meet me at? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above your budget. Although it's tempting to accept, you're within striking distance of your desired price. It's worth pushing for a lower price, as you only have 5 rounds left before needing to make a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $10,500. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Fairness:**  Again emphasizing the idea of finding a compromise that works for both sides.
* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  This is a small increase from your previous offer, signaling flexibility without significantly impacting your budget.
* **Direct Approach:**  Avoids a lot of fluff and gets straight to the point, keeping the negotiation concise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we try $10,800? This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** You only have 3 rounds remaining and Alice's offer is still above your desired price point.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  While you could continue negotiating, you're likely to end up very close to your maximum budget. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:**  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price and allows you to avoid further haggling. 

This decision recognizes that sometimes it's more efficient to secure a good deal than to push for the absolute best possible price, especially when time is a factor."
