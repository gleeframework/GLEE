"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1200000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I believe this product is worth significantly more, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm happy to lower the price to $1300000. This still allows me to recoup a substantial portion of the product's true value. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm eager to reach an agreement with you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
