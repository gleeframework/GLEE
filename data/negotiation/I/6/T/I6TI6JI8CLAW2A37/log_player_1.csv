Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you're making a profit, even if Bob doesn't counteroffer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.

This strategy aims to find a price that is both acceptable to Bob and profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm really interested in the product. Would you be willing to come down to $8,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to $9,000. I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,875, which would be $8,437.50. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,437.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,437.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,437.50 is still below my minimum of $10,000.  While I'm happy to negotiate, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  Rather than continue this back and forth, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000. This ensures I meet my minimum while still selling the product."
