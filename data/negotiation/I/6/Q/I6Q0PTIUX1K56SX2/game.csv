"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to meet you halfway.  This price is still fair considering the product's worth.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? That feels like a fair compromise.",11250.0,Bob,4,
