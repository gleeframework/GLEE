"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Considering my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $1,300,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still concerned about staying within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
