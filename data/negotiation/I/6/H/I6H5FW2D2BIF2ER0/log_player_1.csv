"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and suggesting it's a good deal for him, which might encourage him to accept. 
* **Leaving room:** I'm not asking for my full $120 yet, allowing for potential counteroffers and a negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is interested and has shown willingness to negotiate.  I can likely get a higher price by continuing.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds, and there's no immediate pressure to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a profit.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $110, it's still a good deal for him.
* **Showcasing willingness to compromise:** This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is clearly interested and continuing to negotiate. There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Time remains:**  With 6 rounds left, I have enough time to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep talking. Let's meet in the middle. How about $108? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm on my minimum:** I'm not willing to go below $108, as it's getting close to my minimum.
* **Meeting halfway again:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down further, but I'm also suggesting that this is the final compromise.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm aiming to keep the negotiation positive and friendly to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We're now in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left.
* **Stalemate:** Bob is firmly holding at $105, and I'm unlikely to get higher with only a few rounds remaining. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $120, which is more than Bob's final offer.  

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit now than risk losing more time and potentially getting a worse price with Bob."
