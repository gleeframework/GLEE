"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly special, and I think it's a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you letting me know about this product.  While I do think it sounds interesting, I'm not sure I can justify paying $12000 for it.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $10000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's still a bit higher than your offer, but still reasonable. How about $11500? I think this is a fair middle ground that could work for both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a number that works for both of us.  How about $11000?  It's a fair compromise, and it would let me secure this product without breaking my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more concession. I think $11000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11250? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
