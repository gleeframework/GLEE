Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,500,000, but I'm also willing to negotiate.  This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a price lower than my minimum acceptable value.** This makes it more likely Bob will accept the offer. 
* **Offers a price higher than Bob's estimated value.** This ensures I'm getting a good price for the product.
* **Provides a clear message.**  This helps ensure Bob understands the offer and feels confident in responding. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to counter-offer or sell to John, but I'll try to negotiate with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept anything below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  

I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my desired value.  This will give Bob a chance to meet me in the middle and hopefully reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to work with you, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, and it seems unlikely we'll reach an agreement.  I'm not willing to risk a longer negotiation that could result in an even lower price.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
