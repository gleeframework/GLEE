"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000. Would that be acceptable?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
