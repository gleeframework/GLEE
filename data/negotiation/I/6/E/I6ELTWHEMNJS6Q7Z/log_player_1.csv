Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While selling to John guarantees $800,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a significantly larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  A price of $925,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial gain for Alice. This price point is still significantly attractive to Bob, considering the product's value of $1,000,000 to him. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value and positions Alice as offering a privileged opportunity to Bob."
