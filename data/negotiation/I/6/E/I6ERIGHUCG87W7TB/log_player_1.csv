"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I want to get as close to that as possible.  I know Bob values it at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still a significant loss for me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's too far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $16,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise. I believe this offer is within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay, and it gives us a good starting point for the next round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite enough. I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get a bit more. We still have a few rounds left, and I believe we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm making a final push.  $15,500 is only a bit lower than what John would pay, and still a good profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer, I'm still not happy with $14,000. I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm only $500 away from what John would pay, and I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and close the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. I'm not going to accept a price that's so far below my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed offer from John."
