"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers unique advantages, and its value goes beyond typical market comparisons. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique advantages, but I still think $1,250,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
