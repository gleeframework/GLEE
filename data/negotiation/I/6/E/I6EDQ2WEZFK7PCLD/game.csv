"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000. ",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you and the benefits it will bring to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit much for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the benefits it will bring to your business.",8200.0,Alice,5,
