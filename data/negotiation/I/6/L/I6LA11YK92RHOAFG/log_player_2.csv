Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 400000}
