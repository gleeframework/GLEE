{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum of $150 and significantly lower than my initial offer. I will counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be attractive to Bob while also making sure I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum of $150. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident I'll get a better price from him.  John is offering my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on that sale."
