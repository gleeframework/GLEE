Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $10,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Offering slightly below Bob's perceived value increases your chances of a quick sale.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it at the special price of $11,500. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Why this offer?**

* **Profitable:** You secure a $1,500 profit ($11,500 - $10,000).
* **Attractive to Bob:**  He saves $500 from his perceived value.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially earn even more. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or other factors that might influence his decision."
