# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it at the special price of $11,500. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might come down further in price if you reject her initial offer."
