"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope you'll find it agreeable.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate that.  $975,000 is closer, but still not quite there for me. Let's split the difference -  $1,012,500. I believe this is a fair compromise, and we can finally finalize the deal.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
