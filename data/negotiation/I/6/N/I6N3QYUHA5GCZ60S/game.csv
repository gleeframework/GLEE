"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the discount, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
