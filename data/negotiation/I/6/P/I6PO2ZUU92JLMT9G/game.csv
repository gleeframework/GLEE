"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
