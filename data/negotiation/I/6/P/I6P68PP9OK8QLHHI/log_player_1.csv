Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could start at $15,000, there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price.  $14,000 maximizes potential profit while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a price below our guaranteed sale price, we subtly create a sense of urgency for Bob to act before he potentially loses the deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While we haven't included explicit negotiation in this message, starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to $15,000."
