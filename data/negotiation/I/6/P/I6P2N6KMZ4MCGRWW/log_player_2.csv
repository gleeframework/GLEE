"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $120, and Alice is offering the product for $120, it makes sense to accept the offer. You're not losing any money compared to buying from John."
