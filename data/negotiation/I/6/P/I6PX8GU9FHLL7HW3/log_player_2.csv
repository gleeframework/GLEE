"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Counteroffer is a better option:** You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially getting closer to your desired price.
* **Buying from John is always an option:**  You have a fallback option with John, which is your best-case scenario if you can't get a better deal from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still allows me to achieve a decent return on the product, and it's a much fairer reflection of its value.  What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $875,000 is closer to your budget, it's still $75,000 more than your maximum.
* **Counteroffer is a good option:** You can try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to your $800,000 target.
* **Buying from John is your backup:** You have a safe alternative with John, and if negotiations with Alice fail, you can confidently go with him."
