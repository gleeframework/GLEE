{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I mention the product's true value to me and the potential value to Bob, subtly emphasizing the potential for a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if he finds my initial price too high. 
* **John as Backup:** I keep in mind that John is a backup buyer, allowing me to end the negotiations if Bob becomes too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to his stated value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can counteroffer at a price closer to my desired amount.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm not ready to abandon the negotiation with Bob just yet. There's a chance I can get a better price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still allows me to achieve a decent return on the product, and it's a much fairer reflection of its value.  What do you say? "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, But Not Too Much:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my position.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to remind Bob of its potential worth.
* **Fairness and Return:** I justify the price by highlighting that it still allows me to achieve a decent return. This helps frame the counteroffer as reasonable.
* **Open Ended Question:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially accept my offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $825,000 for the product. This is a significant amount of money for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. I'm hoping we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to his stated value, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **No Further Compromise:**  I've already made significant compromises, and I'm not willing to drop my price any further. Further negotiation will likely result in a price that's not worth my time.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is guaranteed, providing me with the best possible outcome. It's time to take the safe and secure option."
