"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  I think it would be a great fit for you and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a fair compromise:** $13,500 is halfway between Bob's previous offer of $13,000 and Alice's previous offer of $14,000. 
* **It's a good deal for Bob:**  It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and still within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price but could also risk Alice walking away or the deal falling apart entirely."
