"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me.  I could consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a compromise, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
