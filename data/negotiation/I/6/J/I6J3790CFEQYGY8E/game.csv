"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we aim for $950,000? I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but how about $1,050,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a bit steep, I would like to propose $1,025,000. This still allows for a good return for you while keeping the cost reasonable for me. I look forward to your response.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
