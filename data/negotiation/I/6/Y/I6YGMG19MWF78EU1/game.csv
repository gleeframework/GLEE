"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering its value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to buy it from you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal this round.",850000.0,Bob,4,
