"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $875,000. Can you consider that?",875000.0,Bob,4,
