"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is still significantly higher than what John is offering. It's worth negotiating to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:** We maintain a positive tone and express continued interest in the product. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** Our goal is to buy for under $10,000, and this counter-offer sets us on that path."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but we're still not quite there. We have room to negotiate, and it's worth seeing if she'll come down a bit more before taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair offer considering its value and my budget."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're inching closer to Alice's revised offer while staying under our $10,000 limit.
* **Justifying the Price:** We're subtly reminding Alice of both the product's worth and our budgetary constraints to encourage her to accept.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** There's still some wiggle room in case Alice counters again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our bottom line. There's no point in continuing to negotiate as we can get the product for the same price from John. Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice raising her price again or the negotiation failing."
