"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit more than halfway between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately being too low.
* **Friendly opening:** A friendly message sets a positive tone and shows I'm open to negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** A $120 offer leaves room for Bob to counter without me feeling like I've been lowballed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm not desperate. I believe there's room for a higher price.
* **Negotiation is key:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives me the chance to make a counteroffer. I want to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is tempting, I'm hoping for something a bit closer to $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to my desired price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Highlighting the value:** The ""amazing product"" messaging is repeated, subtly reminding Bob of the value he's getting.
* **""Meet me halfway"" approach:** This phrase conveys a willingness to compromise while still positioning myself as the one holding the upper hand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a bit more, Alice. How about $100? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Bob has increased his offer from $90 to $100, which is a significant jump. 
* **Approaching my target:** $100 is closer to my desired price of $120. 
* **Time constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Risk vs. reward:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting the offer guarantees a sale at a respectable price."
