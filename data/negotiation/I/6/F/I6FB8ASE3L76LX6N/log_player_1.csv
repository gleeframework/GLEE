"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, as I know the product is worth that much to me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for it. This will also give me a sense of how much room I have to bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my value, but still not ideal.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my target price.  I want to see if I can get him to budge further before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying close to my ideal price. I believe this is a reasonable offer that could lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $925,000 is getting closer to Bob's value, it's still a significant amount less than my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price.  I'm still hoping for a deal with Bob, but if we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $950,000.  I've already lowered my price once, and I believe this is a fair compromise. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might become the more attractive option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting lower, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I've already lowered my price significantly, and I believe I can still push for a higher price.  It's getting close to the point where I might consider selling to John, but I'm not ready to give up on this deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000. This is a slight concession, but it shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal. However, I'm still holding firm on a price that is closer to my valuation. If he rejects this, I'm seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively lower, and it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement that's satisfactory to both of us. At this point, I'm not willing to continue negotiating and risk losing even more money.  Selling to John guarantees me my target price, and it's time to move on to a more promising opportunity."
