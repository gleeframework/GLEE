"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, Bob! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time deal for you. I'll sell it to you for $16,000. This is a great price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of use out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is ridiculous, she even states that she knows it's only worth $8,000 to you.  You have a guaranteed better option.
