Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $1,450,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000, which I believe is fair given the product's worth to both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but I'm still not quite there. $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,375,000, which is a fair compromise, given both our positions. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000.
