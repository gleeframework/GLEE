"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I believe the product is valuable, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we try $900,000? I think that's a fair offer that considers both of our positions.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering the product for $1,050,000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
