After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I believe the product is valuable, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we try $900,000? I think that's a fair offer that considers both of our positions.
