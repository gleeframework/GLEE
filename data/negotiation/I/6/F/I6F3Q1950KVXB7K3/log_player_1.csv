I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still getting a good price. This offer is also significantly higher than what I'd get from John, giving me a good starting point.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $14,250. This is still above my minimum, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in meeting me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal. If he rejects this, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is now too low.  It's time to move on and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
