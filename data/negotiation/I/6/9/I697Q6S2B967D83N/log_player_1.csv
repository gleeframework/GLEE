Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you.  Please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John provides a strong fallback position, allowing you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob.

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than your minimum while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
