**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating with Bob, he's moving very slowly towards our desired price. At this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly higher than his current offer of $925,000. 

We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. Accepting this offer is the most rational decision at this point. It secures the best possible outcome for us and avoids the risk of further drawn-out negotiations with Bob that might not result in a significantly better deal."
