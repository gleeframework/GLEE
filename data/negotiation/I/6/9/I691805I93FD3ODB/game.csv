"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $10,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair starting point considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. To make this work, I can come down to $19,000.  This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $19,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me while acknowledging your needs.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $12,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's say $17,000, and we have a deal.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $14,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
