"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in.  I'm looking to get $180 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) but below the price John is willing to pay ($180). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm hinting at the value of the product without revealing my true minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:**  His offer of $80 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's also significantly less than what John is willing to pay. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I'm not ready to give up on a higher price yet.  There's still room for negotiation with Bob.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's see if we can find a price we both agree on."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Counter:** My counteroffer of $120 is still above my minimum of $150, but it's also closer to Bob's offer. This creates a middle ground for negotiation.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:** My message uses a positive and encouraging tone, suggesting that we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $120 is still too high for me. I'm firm at $80.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  His offer of $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's a significant loss compared to what John is willing to pay. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob has become firm at $80, indicating there's no room for further negotiation from him.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  Rejecting his offer keeps my options open. I still have 6 rounds left to potentially get a better price. 
* **Potential for a Shift:** While Bob is firm now, he might be more willing to compromise if he sees I'm not willing to accept his low offer.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  If the negotiation with Bob continues to stall, I have the option to sell to John for $150, ensuring a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $80.  I'm willing to go down to $100.  This is a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price again, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Appealing to Common Ground:** I'm highlighting that my offer is ""good for both of us,"" emphasizing the potential for a win-win situation.
* **Shifting Focus:**  I'm reminding Bob that this offer gets us ""closer to a deal,"" emphasizing that continued negotiation is the best path forward.
* **Pressure to Compromise:**  By maintaining a price above his offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to consider increasing his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my offer of $80, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob remains stubbornly firm at $80, and we've already reached a point where my counteroffers are getting me closer to my minimum, but not above it.
* **Time is Limited:** We're at Round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, there's a high chance Bob won't budge. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $150 is significantly higher than Bob's offer and is closer to what I want to get for the product.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob risks ending up with a price below my minimum. Selling to John guarantees a sale at a decent profit.

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell to John to avoid further negotiation with Bob and ensure a secure sale at a fair price."
