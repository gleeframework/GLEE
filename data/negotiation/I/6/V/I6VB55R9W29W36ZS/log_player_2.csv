# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable.

Alice is conceding very small amounts and seems unlikely to reach my target price. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $10,000."
