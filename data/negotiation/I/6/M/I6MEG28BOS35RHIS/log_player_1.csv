I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value while hopefully still being attractive to Bob. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $15,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value and hopefully closer to a price Bob might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $13,500 is still a good deal for me, considering my minimum value is $12,000. It's also closer to my desired price than John's offer.  I'll accept and finalize the deal with Bob."
