"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, given its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice.  While $14,000 isn't terrible, there's room for negotiation within my $15,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price down significantly. It's important to start with a lower offer to leave room for further negotiation, but it's still within a reasonable range considering Alice's valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $13,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to my price, and $13,000 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000. It's unlikely I'll get a much better offer from Alice."
