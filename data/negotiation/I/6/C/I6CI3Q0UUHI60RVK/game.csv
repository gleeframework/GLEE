"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we bring it down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true worth of this product.  How about $14,000? This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
