"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's still a good price for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit and ensures you get a valuable product. Let's find a compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $1,250,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000.  This reflects a genuine compromise on my part, and it's the best I can do.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options. ",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm not willing to go above $1,250,000, and I think that's a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
