Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking $115 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is higher than your minimum value of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $115 is lower than what Bob is willing to pay ($120), leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps keep the negotiation focused and efficient."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum:** While it's lower than your initial offer, it's still above your minimum of $100. 
* **There's potential for a better deal:** You know Bob is willing to pay up to $120, so there's room to negotiate for a higher price.
* **You want to maximize your profit:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you have the chance to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to my original asking price. How about $113?  That would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 113} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is still attractive to Bob:** $113 is still below Bob's maximum value of $120.
* **Counteroffer is closer to your desired price:** $113 is closer to your initial offer of $115 and gets you closer to maximizing your profit.
* **A clear and concise message:** This reinforces your desire to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your desired price:**  $112 is only $1 less than your last counteroffer of $113.
* **There's a risk of losing a sale:** If you keep rejecting, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and you'll be stuck selling to John for $100.
* **You've already maximized your negotiating position:**  You've gotten Bob to agree to a price that's only $8 less than what he was willing to pay initially.

Accepting Bob's offer is the best option because it guarantees a sale at a price that's close to your desired outcome and minimizes the risk of losing a deal."
