"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's less than what the product is worth to her, it's still not a good deal for you.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as you'd still be making a significant profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
