Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as you'd still be making a significant profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
