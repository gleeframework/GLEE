"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as you'd still be making a significant profit.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
