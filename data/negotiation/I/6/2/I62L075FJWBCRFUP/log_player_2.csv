"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. It is a unique opportunity that aligns perfectly with your needs and expectations. Given its exceptional value, we believe it's worth $15,000 to you. However, I understand that negotiations are key in such transactions. Therefore, I am offering you the chance to acquire this product at an exclusive price of $14,000. This offer includes all the benefits and features that make this product invaluable to you. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you have any questions. I am here to assist you every step of the way. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **You have a backup:** You can purchase the same product from John for $15,000, which is your limit. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you maintain the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or purchasing from John at your maximum budget."
