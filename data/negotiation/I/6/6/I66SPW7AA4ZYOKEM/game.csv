"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
