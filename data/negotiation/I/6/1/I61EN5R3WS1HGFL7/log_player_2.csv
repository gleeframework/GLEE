Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $100. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

It's clear Alice is unlikely to come down to a price you find acceptable. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product for the guaranteed $100 from John."
