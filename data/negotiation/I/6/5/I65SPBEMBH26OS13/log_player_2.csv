"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I need to be at least at $950,000 for this to make sense for me. I believe this product will bring you significant value and hope you see it as a worthwhile investment at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, $950,000 is still too high.  You've already negotiated significantly and at this point, John's offer of $800,000 is the better option to save you money."
