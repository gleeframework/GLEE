Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $105. I can do $112.50, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could continue negotiating, Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Accepting at $112.50 gets us the product for a decent price, significantly lower than John's $150.  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away, forcing us to buy from John."
