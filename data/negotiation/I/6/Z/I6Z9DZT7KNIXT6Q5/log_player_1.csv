"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing it positively:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and frames the offer as a ""great deal."" 
* **Opening the door to negotiation:** By asking Bob's opinion, I'm inviting him to engage in a conversation and potentially counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while also considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I hope to get as close to my desired price ($12,000) as possible. However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees $12,000, but there's still a chance I can get closer to that amount with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to bridge the gap between our prices, aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would give you a good deal on a product that you've said is worth $8,000 to you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  I'm moving my price closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that $9,500 is still a good deal.
* **Setting a clear target:**  I'm setting a clear target price, making it easier for Bob to understand my position.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a compromise that's fair to both of us. My goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9500. However, I'm still only able to go as high as $9000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering I can get the product for $8000 elsewhere. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my minimum:** While $9,000 is still below my minimum of $12,000, it's getting closer. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that he'll come up in price. We might get stuck in a stalemate, wasting time and potentially leading to a lower offer from Bob. 
* **Time pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's crucial to capitalize on the opportunity. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to close the deal quickly. This minimizes the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that could result in a lower price."
