"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and compromise on the price. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12000 is still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need at least $13500. This price reflects the value I'm placing on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's work towards a deal that we're both happy with.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can we compromise on this price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
