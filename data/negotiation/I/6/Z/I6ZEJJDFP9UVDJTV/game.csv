"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $16000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, so think carefully before responding.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12000.  Let's try to find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I can do $14000, but I really think the product is worth more than that. This is my final offer for now.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, $14000 is still a little more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to increase my offer to $13000. This is a fair price considering we're both trying to find a deal that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can do $14500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",14500.0,Alice,7,
