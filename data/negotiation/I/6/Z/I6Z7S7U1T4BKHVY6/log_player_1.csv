Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above her minimum price ($12,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing the chances of closing the deal above Alice's minimum. 
* **Secure a Quick Sale:** While Alice has John as a backup, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays and ensures immediate profit."
