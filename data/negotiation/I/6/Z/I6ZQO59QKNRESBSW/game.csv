"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it.  I'm interested, but  $120 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $105?  That's still a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be open to $100?  That's my absolute limit, but I think it's a fair price considering we're both close to our target.",100.0,Bob,4,
