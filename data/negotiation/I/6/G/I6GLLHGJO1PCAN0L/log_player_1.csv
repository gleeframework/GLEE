Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts. He saves $50,000 compared to its value to him, and you earn $150,000 more than your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer without excessive negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is firm, the wording allows for Bob to counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive. You can then decide if a slightly lower price is still acceptable compared to John's guaranteed purchase."
