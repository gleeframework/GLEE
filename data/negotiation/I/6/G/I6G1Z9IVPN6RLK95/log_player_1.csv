"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. While I'm interested, $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $130?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $130 is still a bit low, but I'm open to negotiating further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a little, but $130 is still a bit below my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $135?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
