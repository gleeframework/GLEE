Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $980,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:

While a higher price might be achievable, Bob's offer is significantly above my minimum and there's a risk he will offer even less in future rounds. It's best to accept a good offer now than risk losing the deal."
