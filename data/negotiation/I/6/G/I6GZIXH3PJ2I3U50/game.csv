"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
