Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing it positively:** I'm highlighting the mutual benefit of the deal to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Staying flexible:** I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed, but I'm also aware of John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget, and that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's budget is tight, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can try to meet him halfway, or at least closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John, which provides me with a safety net and leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This price still gives you a good deal while ensuring I can make a reasonable profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a great deal for him, even at the proposed price.
* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, but I'm showing I'm open to negotiation. I'm also aware of John's offer and the need to strike a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has shown some willingness to compromise, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Time is valuable:** Further negotiation might lead to a better price, but it's also a risk. It could drag out the process and potentially lead to a stalemate.
* **John offers certainty:** Selling to John guarantees me the best possible price and a quick transaction. This is the most efficient and secure option at this point."
