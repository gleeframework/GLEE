I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair price and accept."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still slightly lower than my preferred price, it's getting close.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is only offering $8,000."
