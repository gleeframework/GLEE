"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a valuable asset, and I believe it has the potential to be a great investment for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,400,000 is a significant amount for Bob, but it still allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Building a Relationship:** The message emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob, fostering a positive interaction and setting a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I won't sell for less.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even though Bob's offer is my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to explore a counteroffer to potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Strategic Play:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm serious about getting a fair price. It also keeps the negotiation open for me to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me to consider selling.  I'm prepared to come down a bit to $1,350,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focusing on Value:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to see the worth of the deal. 
* **Finding a Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a solution, highlighting a collaborative approach to reach an agreement. 
* **Maintaining My Ground:**  $1,350,000 is still above my minimum, ensuring I don't accept an offer below my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I'm not in a hurry to sell. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially get closer to my target price.
* **Building Momentum:** By consistently rejecting lower offers, I'm building momentum and showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  I'm confident I can counter with a price that's more advantageous for me in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,325,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while also being within your budget.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1325000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1290000, but I don't think I can go any higher. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

* **Strategic Play:**  By rejecting the offer, I'm maintaining my position and showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my target. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is an option, I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds to potentially secure a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and understanding. I'm willing to come down just a bit more, to $1,295,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down further, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1285000, but I don't think I can go any higher. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,285,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. With only two rounds remaining, the chances of securing a price higher than $1,285,000 are slim.
* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue to negotiate, the potential gain is minimal, and I risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Secure Option:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.  

At this point, it's more prudent to secure the guaranteed sale to John than to risk getting a slightly better price from Bob and possibly ending up with no deal at all."
