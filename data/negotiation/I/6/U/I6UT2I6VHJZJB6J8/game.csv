"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $22,000 is my initial asking price, I am open to negotiation.  How about we meet halfway at $15,500?  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see its value.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, but that's still much higher than I can justify. If you're willing to come down to $11,000, I think we could make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is less than I'm hoping to get for the product. I could be persuaded to go as low as $13,000.  That's a very fair offer considering the value this product offers.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see the value in the product, but I have a strict budget. Would you consider $11,500? That's the most I can offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Let's settle this right now. If you can meet me at $12,250, we have a deal. This is my final offer.",12250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate that this is your final offer, but I can't go that high. If you're willing to reconsider and accept $11,750, the deal is yours.",11750.0,Bob,8,
