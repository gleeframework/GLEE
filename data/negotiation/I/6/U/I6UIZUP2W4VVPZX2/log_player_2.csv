"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering what you'll gain from it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move forward, I could consider $1,050,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further. I'll counter with a price closer to my target of $800,000."

This is a firm offer, reflecting the absolute lowest price I can consider given the product's worth. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your final decision.

Alice's final offer of $1,000,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While I would prefer to secure the product from Alice, it's not worth overpaying.  I'll go with John's offer, as it's within my budget and allows me to achieve my goal of buying the product."
