"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at $1500000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000, a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1400000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1200000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This price allows me to still earn a fair amount while still offering you a competitive deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
