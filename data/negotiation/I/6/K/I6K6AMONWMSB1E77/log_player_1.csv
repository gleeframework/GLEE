Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $1,500,000?**  I'm aiming for a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This price is high enough to incentivize Bob to buy if he values the product highly, but it's not so high that it's immediately out of the question.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer, but the potential reward of an extra $500,000 outweighs that risk.
* **Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always lower it slightly in subsequent negotiations. However, starting high allows me to explore the upper limits of his potential value for the product."
