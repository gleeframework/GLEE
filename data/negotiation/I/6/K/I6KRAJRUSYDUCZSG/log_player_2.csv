"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $10,000. There's a chance you can get a better price from Alice, or at least get her closer to your ideal price range."
