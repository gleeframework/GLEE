"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $13,750. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with the value you'll get from it.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $13,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,500. This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,250. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. However, $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $13,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $13,200. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13200.0,Alice,7,
