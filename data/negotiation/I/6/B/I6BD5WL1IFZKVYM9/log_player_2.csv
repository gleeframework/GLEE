"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still a significant amount of money.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price by making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice is willing to negotiate further, especially since she's already stated she's confident you won't find a better offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to get a price closer to $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it gives you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved significantly from her initial price of $950,000 to $875,000. This is a good deal, considering my target is $1,500,000 from John.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's significantly lower than my fallback option."
