Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand your valuation of the product, but I would like to stick to my initial proposal. I am still willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob seems firmly set on $95 and is unlikely to budge. It's not worth the risk of him holding firm and wasting more rounds when I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John."
