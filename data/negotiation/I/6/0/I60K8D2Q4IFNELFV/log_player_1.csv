Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,750,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my target. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about we settle at $1,350,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $1,350,000 is still too low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,350,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting tricky. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I've already gone down a significant amount.  If I keep rejecting, I risk Bob walking away or losing too much time.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
