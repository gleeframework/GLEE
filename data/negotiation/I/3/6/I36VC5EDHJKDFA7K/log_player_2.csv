"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great investment for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly stating the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, indicating she's unwilling to budge much on price.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at the same price. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility for her to make a counter-offer at a lower price, getting you a better deal. It's worth seeing if she'll come down before resorting to John."
