"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to offer you $9500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10500.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $11250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
