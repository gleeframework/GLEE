You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Offering $900,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously, while still being within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's a significant discount from his initial budget of $1,200,000 and it's likely that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price. Accepting the offer ensures that Bob gets the product at a good price without the risk of the negotiations falling through or being drawn out further."
