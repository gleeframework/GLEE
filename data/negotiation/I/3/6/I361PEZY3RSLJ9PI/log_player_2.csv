"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still above your maximum price of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
