"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) and to Bob ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" and the product's value to make the offer more appealing. 

**Reasoning:**

It's a good strategy to start high and leave space for negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my ideal goal. While Bob might reject the offer, it sets the stage for a counter-offer and gives me leverage in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in your product, $9000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum price ($8,000), it's still below my desired range.  I'm rejecting his offer and moving to the next round. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.
* **Gaining Information:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to gather more information about his willingness to pay and understand his bargaining strategy. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I keep the negotiating power in my hands.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $7,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial price ($9,000) and Bob's offer ($7,500). 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage further discussion. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Common Ground:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to find a compromise. 
* **Balancing Positions:** It allows for a potential deal while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  I'm staying above my minimum price of $8,000 to ensure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $8200.  This is a fair price, and it's closer to my budget. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,200 is above my minimum price of $8,000 and represents a good deal. I'm accepting his offer to secure the sale.

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** The price is above my minimum, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to continue negotiating. 
* **Potential for Delay:**  Further negotiation could lead to delays and the potential for John to make a better offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'm happy to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
