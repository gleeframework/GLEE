``` 

This is a good offer to accept. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,550,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now is generally better than potentially dragging on negotiations and risking a worse outcome.
* **Stronger Position:** Bob is clearly motivated and has moved closer to your price point with each offer. Accepting now capitalizes on that momentum."
