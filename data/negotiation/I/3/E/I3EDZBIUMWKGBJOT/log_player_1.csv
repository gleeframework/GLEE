Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Understanding the risk:**  I'm aware that this could lead to Bob rejecting my offer. However, this strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter-offer based on his response and my assessment of his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. The actual offer should be adjusted based on the specific product and your knowledge of Bob's potential value for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested in the product. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding the ""safe"" option:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but it limits my potential profit. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob to see if I can get a better price. 

**Next Round:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  The counteroffer will be carefully calculated based on Bob's initial offer and my assessment of his potential value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm counter-offering with $1,200,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer of $1,500,000 but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to find a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer. 
* **Testing the waters:** I'm gauging Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess his perceived value and potentially adjust my strategy further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to minimum:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob presents a risk of going back and forth for a long time without reaching a satisfactory price. 
* **Guaranteeing Profit:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures a guaranteed profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether.

**Decision:** 

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I would have preferred a higher price, this option guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
