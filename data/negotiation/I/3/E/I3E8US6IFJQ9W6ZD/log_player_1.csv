Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but lower than my minimum of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message helps build rapport and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly states that I'm open to negotiation, signaling that Bob doesn't have to accept my first offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation, $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can still try to get a higher price from Bob. It's worth seeing if we can find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my desired range but still lower than my current minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $100 to $95.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits of the product.
* **Leaving Room for Further Negotiation:**  I'm still open to further negotiation, keeping the conversation going and potentially achieving a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely or that I'll waste time getting a slightly higher price.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $120, but I'm already close to that price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $90. This ensures I get a decent profit without risking further negotiation."
