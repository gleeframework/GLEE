"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her actual value for the product, it's still above your maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is within my budget and is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will either reject my next counteroffer or that I might end up having to buy from John for the full $1,000,000. Accepting this offer gives me a good deal, saves time, and minimizes risk."
