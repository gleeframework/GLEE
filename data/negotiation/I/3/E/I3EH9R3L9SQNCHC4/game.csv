"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
