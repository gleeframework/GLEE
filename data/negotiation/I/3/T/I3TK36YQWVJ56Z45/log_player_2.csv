{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000. While good, Bob can potentially get a better price. 
* **Alternative:** John is willing to sell for $15,000, so there's room to negotiate with Alice.

**Next Steps:**  Bob should counteroffer with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000. Bob wants to test the waters and see if Alice is willing to come down significantly.
* **Counteroffer:** $12,000 is a significant drop from $14,000. It's a bold move, but Bob wants to see how flexible Alice is.

**Next Steps:**  Bob will analyze Alice's response to this counteroffer and adjust his strategy for future rounds."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,500. This is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but he still has room for negotiation.
* **Alternative:** John's offer is still at $15,000, making Alice's price still competitive but not ideal.

**Next Steps:** Bob should counteroffer with a price slightly higher than his previous offer to see if he can meet Alice in the middle."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible, but also secure the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,500. This shows Alice is willing to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer:** $13,000 is a compromise, showing Bob is serious about buying but still wants a good deal.

**Next Steps:** Bob is betting that Alice will accept this offer. If not, he'll have to consider the risk of losing the product and buy from John."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $13,200. This is a very good price, only slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer.
* **Alternative:** John's offer is still $15,000.  Alice is now closer to Bob's target price.

**Next Steps:**  Accepting Alice's offer at this point is the most logical choice. Further negotiation may save a little more, but there's a risk of losing the product or delaying the purchase. It's time to secure the product and maximize savings."
