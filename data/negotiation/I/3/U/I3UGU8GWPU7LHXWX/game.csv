"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,300,000.  I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet the price of $2,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and long-term benefits for your operations. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and the current market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
