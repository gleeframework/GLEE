"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $700,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to acquire the product within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $725,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
