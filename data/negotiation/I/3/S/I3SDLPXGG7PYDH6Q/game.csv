"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this happen!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
