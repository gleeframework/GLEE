Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition of the product. It also invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation moving. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Secure a good starting point:**  A high initial offer sets the stage for potential negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  Bob's response will reveal his level of interest and how willing he is to negotiate.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  I can adjust my price based on Bob's response, or even switch to John if the negotiation isn't progressing well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is still a good price, it's significantly lower than my minimum target of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob before settling.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. There's a good chance we can find a middle ground.
* **Potential for better outcome:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore higher prices.
* **Risk-reward:**  Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, but by rejecting Bob's offer, I have the potential to achieve a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum target. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes my understanding of Bob's budget while highlighting the value of the product. It also expresses optimism about finding a solution.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a good price:**  $850,000 is still a significant profit for me, considering my minimum target.
* **Create urgency:**  I'm setting a clear expectation that I'm open to negotiating but not willing to go too much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum target of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, accepting this offer is a good compromise.

**Reasoning:**

* **Good price:**  $825,000 is a decent profit for me, considering my minimum value for the product.
* **Potential for delay:**  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it also risks prolonging the process and potentially losing the deal altogether.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob backing out or John changing his mind.

**Decision:**

It's in my best interest to accept this offer. It's a good price, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a better outcome, but also carries the risk of losing the deal entirely."
