"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Since you don't know Alice's true value, there's a good chance you can get it for less than $500,000."

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will test the waters and see how flexible Alice is."

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll continue to try and lower the price further."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying but still aiming for a price lower than her current offer. This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000.

Alice is still too high. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm raising my offer to $400,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying, but I'm still not willing to meet her current price. I'm hoping that we can reach a compromise in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd still prefer a lower price, Alice's offer is now only $75,000 higher than my last counteroffer.  It's getting close to the point where it's not worth risking another round of negotiation. I'd rather secure the product and avoid potentially losing it to John if I keep rejecting offers."
