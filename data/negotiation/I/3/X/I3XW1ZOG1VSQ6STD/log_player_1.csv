Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Scenario**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he could potentially profit up to $500,000.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (so he doesn't reject it) but also gets you as close to $1,500,000 as possible.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Creating a sense of exclusivity and value emphasizes the product's worth to Bob.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,350,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $150,000 â€“ a good incentive to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong offer, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing your profit slightly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits. If you had more insights into Bob, you could potentially refine your offer further."
