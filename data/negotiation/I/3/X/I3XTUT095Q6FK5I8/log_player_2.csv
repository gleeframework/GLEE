"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, it's still above his maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob starts by offering a price close to his maximum budget, leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about buying but also trying to be fair.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product, hoping to encourage Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Over Budget:** Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for More Negotiation:** Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Since Alice is already willing to come down, there's potential for further compromise.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The option to buy from John for $10,000 is still available, so Bob isn't taking a huge risk by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  If you can come down to $10,750, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer.
* **Realistic Price:**  $10,750 is still a significant saving for Bob while allowing Alice to make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $10750 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10875.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Still Too High:** While $10,875 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but there's also a chance Alice might not budge further, leaving Bob with a worse deal. 
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:** Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget, avoiding further negotiation and potential for a worse outcome."
