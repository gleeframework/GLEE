Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is still a bit high for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest and for your latest offer. We've considered your proposal carefully, and we're pleased to extend our offer at $575000 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still allowing us to cover our costs and ensure a fair return for our investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $575,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $550,000.  Accepting this offer means saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. While I could continue negotiating, the potential savings are relatively small, and the risk of Alice walking away or me running out of rounds is high. It's a good compromise."
