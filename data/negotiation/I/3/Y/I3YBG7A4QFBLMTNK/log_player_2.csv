Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,250?  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.

While closer to a reasonable price, we can still try to negotiate a bit further down before considering Alice's offer or resorting to John's price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Alice has come down considerably, and $9,000 is a reasonable price, saving us $3,000 from John's offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results."
