"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's own valuation of the product.  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're open to negotiations.  However,  $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  While $1,350,000 is lower than the initial offer, it's still above Alice's valuation. There's room for further negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,325,000. This is a fair price, and I believe we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,325,000 is a bit more than you're comfortable with, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,375,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is lower than Bob's ""Plan B"" price of $1,500,000 from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and Bob will be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer is the best choice to secure the product at a price lower than John's offer."
