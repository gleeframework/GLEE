"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're open to negotiations.  However,  $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,325,000. This is a fair price, and I believe we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,325,000 is a bit more than you're comfortable with, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,375,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
