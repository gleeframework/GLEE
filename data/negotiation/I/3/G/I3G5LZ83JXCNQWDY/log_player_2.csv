"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and get a lower price, especially since you have a safety net with John's offer.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

Let's start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will give us room to negotiate and see how much wiggle room Alice has."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to our offer, but there's still room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get closer to our desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4250}
```

We'll increase our offer slightly, but still stay below Alice's current price. This shows that we're serious about negotiating and hopefully encourage her to meet us in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and we're getting closer to our desired price range. It's unlikely we'll get a lower price from Alice at this point.  It's a good deal, and we can save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
