Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I know it's valuable to you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $150. Offering a price significantly lower than this ($120) still allows for a healthy profit margin while increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong initial offer, it doesn't start at Bob's maximum valuation. This leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Consider the Alternative:** Selling to John guarantees $80. This offer aims for significantly more while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
