"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you thinking of me, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $95. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $105. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than you're willing to pay, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $108. I think it's a great value for the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
