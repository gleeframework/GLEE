Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $800,000, so he might be willing to pay a little more to get it.
* **Lower than my minimum acceptable price:** I won't sell for less than $1,000,000, so I'm still getting a good deal. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so this is a calculated risk.  This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob."
