{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being ripped off.
* **It shows confidence:**  By starting high, you demonstrate that you value your product. 

We'll see how Bob reacts and adjust our strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $13,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is a decent offer and above your minimum, it's still lower than your initial price. You can try to get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $14,000? It's still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Compromise:**  It meets Bob halfway, showing flexibility.
* **Maintain profit:**  It keeps the price above your minimum, ensuring a good return.
* **Stay firm:**  It doesn't completely cave to Bob's lower offer, signaling that you value your product."
