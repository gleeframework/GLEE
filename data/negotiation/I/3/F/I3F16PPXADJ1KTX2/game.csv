"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,500. Let's try to close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10,800. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
