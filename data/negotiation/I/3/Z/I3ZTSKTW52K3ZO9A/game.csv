"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $75 is still a bit low for me.  How about $85?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I could do $78, and I think that's a very fair offer.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $78 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $81.  This gives you a great deal on the product and ensures I can make a fair profit.  What do you think?",81.0,Alice,7,
