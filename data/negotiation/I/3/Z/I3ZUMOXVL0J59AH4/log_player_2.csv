Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85.  While she might budge a little, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price and you ending up paying more than John's offer.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $80 from John, which is a better outcome than potentially paying $85 or more with Alice."
