{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also using a friendly and encouraging tone to hopefully make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to try to get closer to my asking price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to negotiate, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to work with you on this, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112 as a final offer. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 112}
