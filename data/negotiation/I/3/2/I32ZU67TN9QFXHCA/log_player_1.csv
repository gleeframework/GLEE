Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer sets a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to:

* **Start the negotiation high:** This leaves room for concessions later.
* **Test Bob's interest:** If he's willing to pay close to your minimum, it's a good sign.
* **Maintain leverage:** Knowing you have a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives you confidence in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to maintain control and potentially push for a higher price.  Selling to John immediately would guarantee your minimum, but you might be able to get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Meet Bob halfway:** It's a compromise between your previous offer and his, showing flexibility.
* **Stay above your minimum:**  You're still earning significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Test Bob's commitment:** If he's serious about buying, he might be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is now very close to your desired price point. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum and likely very close to what you could achieve with further negotiation."
