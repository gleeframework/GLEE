"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial price, it's still higher than your desired maximum of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above my maximum budget. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also demonstrating my commitment to getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if we can get closer to my target. I can potentially offer a higher price than my previous counteroffer, but still below Alice's current offer, to show that I'm serious about buying the product but still need a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $900,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but it's still below her current offer.  It's a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
