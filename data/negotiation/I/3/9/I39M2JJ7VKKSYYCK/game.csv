"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  I've done my research and truly believe this product is worth considerably more in your hands. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product offers you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up on your offer. To be frank, I'm getting close to what I need for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,275,000?  This reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,275,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,260,000, which is a fair compromise given my previous offer and your desire to sell.  I'm confident this price is beneficial for both of us.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
