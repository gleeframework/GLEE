Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal.  Let me know your thoughts.
