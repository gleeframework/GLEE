**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more. We're still in early rounds, and holding firm might push him closer to the $1.1 million mark."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering our previous discussions and the product's value, I would like to propose a price of $1,080,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, and we're now at $1,080,000. While we could potentially push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk Bob will stop negotiating.  Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit of $80,000 over our guaranteed sale to John and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation."
