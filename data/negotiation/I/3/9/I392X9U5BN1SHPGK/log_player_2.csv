"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to accept $850,000 yet.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue haggling and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $825,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept.  I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price, especially since I have a fallback option with John.  I want to see if I can get Alice to come down a bit more before I commit."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $810,000.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while also reflecting my budget. Let's close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 810000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $810000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $820000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and Alice has been consistently lowering her price. While I'd prefer to pay less, $820,000 is a good deal considering the value of the product to me.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard, and I'm confident I can save more money by negotiating on other terms later. It's also getting risky to keep rejecting offers, as I might be forced to buy from John at a higher price if I run out of rounds."
