Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd be willing to pay $850000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows us to close the deal quickly.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm prepared to pay $860000. This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, and it's still a fair price for a product of this caliber. What do you say?
