I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $2000000. What do you think?,2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1800000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1800000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but that's the highest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1700000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal considering the product's value.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $1650000?",1650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering you a price of $1700000. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a dedicated support package. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher, and I'm starting to think about buying from John for $1000000",1600000.0,Bob,8,
