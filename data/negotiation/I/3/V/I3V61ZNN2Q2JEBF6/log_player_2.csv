"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
