Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than you might realize at first glance. I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000. I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I need to aim for a price higher than that to maximize my profit with Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:**  Offering it at $950,000 is a high price but still leaves room for Bob to gain some value ($50,000). It's a strong opening move in the negotiation.
* **Confident Messaging:**  By emphasizing the product's value and Bob's potential return on investment, I aim to influence his perception and increase the likelihood of him accepting a higher price."
