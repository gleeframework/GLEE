,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at 140? I think that's a fair compromise.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $130.  If you're willing to go that low, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to listen to your proposal, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. How about we try 135? It's a bit of a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",135.0,Alice,5,
