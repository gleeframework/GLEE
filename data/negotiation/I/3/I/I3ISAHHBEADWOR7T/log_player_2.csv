"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for $120 or less. Alice's offer of $180 is far above his limit. It's more beneficial to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120 at this time. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at 140? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $130.  If you're willing to go that low, I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to listen to your proposal, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. How about we try 135? It's a bit of a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for $120 or less.  Even though Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to bargain for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still hoping to get this done at $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and it saves us both time. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. How about we try 132? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is close to his target price. While $132 is slightly higher than $120, it's a reasonable compromise. He only has a few rounds left and it's likely Alice won't go lower. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves him from potentially having to buy from John, which would be a more expensive option."
