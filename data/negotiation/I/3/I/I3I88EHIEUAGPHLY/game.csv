"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can we compromise on that price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
