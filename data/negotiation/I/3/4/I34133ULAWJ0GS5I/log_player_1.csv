Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, potentially pushing the price closer to $15,000. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, aiming just below your guaranteed price might make Bob more receptive than a seemingly exorbitant initial offer. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
