"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12000. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, based on my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within my maximum limit of $12000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to meet my financial situation?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you a price of $11000. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price of $8000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While I appreciate the offer, I'm still unable to meet at $11000. I would like to propose $10500 as a potential compromise. This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still securing the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to compromise, Bob. I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to ensure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $10750? It's still a great price for you, and it's a bit closer to my minimum price. Let me know if this works for you.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering my financial constraints, I would like to propose $10500 as a final offer. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already offered you a better deal at $10750. I'm not willing to go back to $10500. I think I've been flexible enough. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $10750. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",10750.0,Alice,7,
