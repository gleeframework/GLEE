Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher initially allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $18,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but it provides room for negotiation. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning listing the product publicly implies scarcity and might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message invites Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $15,000.

**Outcome:**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts the $18,000 offer, netting you a significant profit.
* **Acceptable Case:** Bob negotiates but settles on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer, and you sell to John for your guaranteed $15,000."
