"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $145? It's a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $145 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value is $150 to you. Can you consider this offer?",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $137.50? It's a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",137.5,Alice,5,
