"Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your budget. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $1,250,000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
