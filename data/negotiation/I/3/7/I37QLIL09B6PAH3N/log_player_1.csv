Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer the product at $150, Bob is unlikely to accept since it's worth less to him. Your goal is to get the highest price Bob will accept.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  $135 represents a potential compromise. It allows you to earn more than Bob values the product for ($135 vs. $120) while still offering him a price that might be tempting compared to not getting the product at all. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, so there's no risk of getting stuck with the product if Bob declines."
