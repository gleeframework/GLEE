Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate. It's important to leave space for potential counteroffers, while still getting a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I can potentially get more by continuing negotiations.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $13,500. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a profit closer to my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not willing to go below $12,000.  Since John is willing to buy for my minimum, I'm going to sell to John to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get my minimum price."
