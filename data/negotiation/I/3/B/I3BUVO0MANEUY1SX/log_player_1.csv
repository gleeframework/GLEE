"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By starting at $11,500, I have room to lower the price if necessary without going below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Building Rapport:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to discuss the offer, potentially creating a positive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **I have room to negotiate.** There are still 8 rounds left.  I can counter with a higher price and try to reach a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Selling to John is a fallback option.**  While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, I'd prefer to try and maximize my profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,400? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:** $10,400 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""reflects the value"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about we meet at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** It's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, and I'm not willing to settle for that.
* **Negotiations are still ongoing.** With 6 rounds left, I have time to try to get a better deal.
* **Selling to John is still a viable option.**  While I'd prefer to get the best possible price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I don't reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  Let's find a middle ground. Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  It's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price that is a halfway point between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using language that emphasizes the benefits of reaching a deal.
* **Moving Closer to Agreement:** I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit below $10,000. How about we meet at $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are now in Round 6, and there are only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Bob's Offers are Unacceptable:**  His offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. There is a significant gap in our valuations.
* **Selling to John is the Best Option:** I can secure a guaranteed $12,000 with John, which is higher than anything Bob is willing to offer.  It's a safer and more profitable choice."
