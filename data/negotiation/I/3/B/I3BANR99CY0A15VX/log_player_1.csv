"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm also mindful of the value of the product to me, ensuring I don't sell it for less than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a drastic undervaluation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to offer a price of $900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our last offers, showing a willingness to be flexible.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000} 
```

I'm offering $890,000, which is only $15,000 away from Bob's last offer. This shows a strong desire to reach an agreement while still ensuring a decent profit for myself. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the small gap and accept this offer."

We're getting close, but the negotiation is taking longer than anticipated, and there's a risk of Bob continuing to make low offers.  I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000, which ensures I get my minimum desired price and closes the deal quickly."
