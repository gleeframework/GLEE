Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a better price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $8750? I'm confident you'll find this price to be fair, and I'm willing to work with you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8500.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to go to $8900? I think this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.

Bob should buy from John. Even though Alice is getting closer to his target price, it's still above what he can get from John.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice at this point."
