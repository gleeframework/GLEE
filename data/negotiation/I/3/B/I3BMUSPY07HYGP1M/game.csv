"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,200?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,900? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  $7,900 is very close to what I need, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,000? This is my final offer, and it's the price that John is willing to pay. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll be forced to go with John.",8000.0,Alice,5,
