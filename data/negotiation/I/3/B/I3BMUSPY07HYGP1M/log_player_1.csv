"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,200?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,900? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,900 is closer to my minimum value, it's still slightly below it.  I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more in the next round before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  $7,900 is very close to what I need, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,000? This is my final offer, and it's the price that John is willing to pay. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll be forced to go with John."", ""product_price"": 8000}
