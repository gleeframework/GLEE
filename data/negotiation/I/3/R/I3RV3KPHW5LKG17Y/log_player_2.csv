Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value. Let's close this deal, I'm confident you won't regret it.

``` 

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is very unlikely to go below $95 at this point, and you have a guaranteed price of $100 with John.  It's not worth risking further negotiation for a potential savings of $5."
