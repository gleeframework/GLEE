{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's slightly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also expresses my willingness to work with Bob, increasing the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $125? I'm really interested in this product, but that's my top range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $135?  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $135 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $130. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is still a little below my minimum, it's getting closer. I don't want to risk losing Bob completely, and $130 is a good compromise."
