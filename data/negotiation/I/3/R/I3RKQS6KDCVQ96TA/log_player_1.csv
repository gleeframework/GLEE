""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price positions the product as high-value while still making it a compelling deal for Bob, who gains $100,000 in perceived value."
