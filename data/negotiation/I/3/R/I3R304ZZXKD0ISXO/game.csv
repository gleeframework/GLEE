"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm looking to get a fair price for it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $950,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $825,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we possibly settle on $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $760,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $795,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",795000.0,Alice,5,
