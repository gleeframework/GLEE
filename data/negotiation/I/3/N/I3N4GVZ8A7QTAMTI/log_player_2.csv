Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is considerably lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value you'll get from the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value you'll get from the product, and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, she's still significantly above John's offer of $800,000.  It's unlikely she'll go that low, and at this point, it's less risky to secure the product from John at the known price."
