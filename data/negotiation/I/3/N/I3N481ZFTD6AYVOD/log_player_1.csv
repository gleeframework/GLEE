{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
``` 
 
I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than $120 to Bob."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though it's getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better deal. I'll try to counter with a price closer to $120."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

I'm going to offer $115. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and encourage Bob to accept."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, he'll walk away and I'll end up with nothing. John's offer is my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing that."
