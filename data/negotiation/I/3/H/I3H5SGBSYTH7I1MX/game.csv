"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. Would you like to make an offer on the product?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your price is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,500? It's closer to your desired price than my previous offer, and I'm still within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about buying the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,750, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,750 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? This would be a great deal for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,375, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can shake on it.",13375.0,Alice,7,
