"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to earn more than my minimum while giving you a significant discount. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum and saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John."
