# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm confident it holds equal value for your business.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to gain significant value, and it ensures I don't have to take a significant loss.  What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $975,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to gain something from this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
