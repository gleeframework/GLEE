"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,250 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's aim for a final compromise at $8,750.  This gives us both a fair deal and allows me to move forward with this sale. ",8750.0,Alice,5,
