"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, and there's no reason to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a firm price in mind. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to accept $800000 at this time. I'm willing to come down to $850000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what John is selling the product for, and there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further.  It's in Bob's best interest to secure the product at the lowest possible price."
