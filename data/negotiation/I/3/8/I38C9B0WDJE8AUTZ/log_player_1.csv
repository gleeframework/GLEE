Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my own minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** A $900,000 offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately needing to resort to John's offer.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might encourage him to consider the offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes earning as much money as possible while acknowledging Bob's perceived value. It leaves open the possibility of a successful negotiation with Bob while having a backup option in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm only willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $800,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While his offer is low, it's still an opening for further negotiation. Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially raise the price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer is a Safe Backup:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will send Bob a counteroffer that is likely to be higher than $800,000 but lower than my initial $900,000 offer. This gives Bob a chance to negotiate while still ensuring I get a better price than his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a firm price in mind. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to accept $800,000 at this time. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $850,000 splits the difference between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($800,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer still allows room for further negotiation, potentially leading to a final price somewhere between $850,000 and $900,000.
* **Maintaining a Higher Price:**  It's important to maintain a price that is closer to my desired range, as I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's initial offer.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to carefully consider whether to make another counteroffer or move forward with John's offer. The decision will depend on how confident I am in the potential for reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
