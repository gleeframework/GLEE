Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It allows for some negotiation room, but it also shows Bob that I believe the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy with $8,000, Bob's offer is very low and doesn't leave room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, but still allows me to make a profit.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's a bit less than my ideal price, but it's still higher than what John is offering. To avoid further negotiation, I'll accept Bob's offer."
