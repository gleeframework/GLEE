Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get more. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is agreeable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially get a worse deal.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my safety net."
