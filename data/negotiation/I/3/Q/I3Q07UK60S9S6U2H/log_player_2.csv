**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be stuck on a price point that's not significantly better than your backup option with John.  She's gone back to $9,250, which you've already rejected.  At this stage, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. Buying from John for $12,000 is the safer bet to ensure you get the product without the risk of the negotiation failing completely."
