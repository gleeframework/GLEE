"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $700,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $650,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land closer to $620,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",620000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to $620,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $630,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",630000.0,Alice,5,
