Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth a lot more than my asking price.  Are you interested in purchasing it for $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 allows for some potential haggling. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still likely settle above our minimum ($80).
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it for $80 immediately might make Bob think it's worth even less.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a tempting offer and maximizing potential profit."
