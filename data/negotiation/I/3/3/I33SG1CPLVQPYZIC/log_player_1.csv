Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and might give Bob the impression the product is valued even higher. 
* **Aiming for Above Bob's Value:** While I know Bob values it at $800,000, there's a chance he might be willing to go higher depending on its importance to him. This initial offer tests that possibility.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000. This knowledge empowers me to be firm in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's seriously interested. By rejecting and countering, I can potentially secure a better deal than $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return on this. Could you consider $1,450,000?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not significantly. This signals I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate. 
* **Above My Minimum:** This counteroffer still keeps me comfortably above my $1,200,000 minimum and allows room for further negotiation if Bob pushes back."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire for a higher return, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $100,000 more than my guaranteed sale with John. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing Bob as a buyer isn't worth the potential gain.  It's a good deal, and accepting now secures a profitable sale."
