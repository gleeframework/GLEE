"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $100. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $140? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price.  He can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still more than I can comfortably spend. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $100, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we try $130? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $100. While Bob could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further. Since Bob can buy the same product from John for $100, it's in his best interest to take that option. There's no guarantee he'll get a better price with Alice, and he's already spent several rounds without reaching his desired price."
