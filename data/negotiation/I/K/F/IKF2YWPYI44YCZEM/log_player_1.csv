Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed offer gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and leaves room for negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **High but Justifiable:**  $1,450,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but your message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price. 

This strategy aims to either:

1. **Secure a higher sale price:** Bob might be willing to pay more than $1,000,000 if he's convinced of the product's value.
2. **Move to your guaranteed sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired price."
