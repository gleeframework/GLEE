{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Bob knows exactly what's being offered. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find a compromise that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my desired outcome. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to counteroffer."
