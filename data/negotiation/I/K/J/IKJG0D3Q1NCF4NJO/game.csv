,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find a compromise that works for us both.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's aim for a quick resolution.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
