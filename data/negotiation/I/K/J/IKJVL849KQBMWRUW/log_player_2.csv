"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $100, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to get closer to Alice's value of $80. This shows he's serious about buying but is also trying to get a good deal. The message is friendly and encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 87.50? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87.50 is a better offer than $90, Bob is still aiming to get closer to his desired price point. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price. There are still rounds left, so there's time to haggle further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $87.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal at $86. How about we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 86}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price point. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming to get a good deal. The message is friendly and encourages a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at 88? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, and there are only 5 rounds left. At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially reaching an impasse is higher than the benefit of trying to save a couple more dollars. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without risking losing the opportunity altogether."
