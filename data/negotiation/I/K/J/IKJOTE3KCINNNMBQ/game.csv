"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential of this product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I value this product at a minimum of $1,325,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What are your thoughts?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value you'll gain from it. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  How about $1,285,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close a deal here.",1285000.0,Bob,6,
