{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  $850,000 is more than your maximum budget, so it's not a good starting point. You'll want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get the price closer to my ideal range. While $750,000 is still above my maximum budget, it's a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $820,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below my maximum budget.  $780,000 is a good compromise, and I believe Alice might be more receptive to this offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $810,000 is closer to my target, it's still not within my ideal range. I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to push the price down further before considering buying from John. There are still 5 rounds remaining, and I believe there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 790000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting close to my maximum budget, but I believe this offer is within a reasonable range for Alice.  I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be forced to consider buying from John, as I'm getting closer to the end of negotiations."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $805,000 is only $5,000 over my maximum budget, I'm still hesitant to accept. With only three rounds left, I believe I can still push for a lower price. I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further, especially since John is offering the product for $800,000.  I'm hoping to secure a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at my absolute maximum budget. With only two rounds remaining, I'm hoping to reach a deal with Alice. If she rejects this offer, I'll be forced to buy from John as I'm out of negotiating room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $802,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $802,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round remaining and Alice's offer still above my maximum budget, it's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer. While it's not my ideal price, I'm not willing to risk another round with Alice and potentially end up with a worse deal or no deal at all.  It's more prudent to secure the product from John at the $800,000 price and move on."
