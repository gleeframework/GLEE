Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $22,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a high offer allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value and scarcity by mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity"" and listing it ""publicly."" This aims to justify the high price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects it. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below your guaranteed $15,000."
