"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. It's a bit lower than your initial offer, but I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $700000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This price still gives you a significant savings, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $850000, so I'll offer $775000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
