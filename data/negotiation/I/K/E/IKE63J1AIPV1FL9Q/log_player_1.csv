Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm ready to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little low for me.  How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering $110. This is still a decent profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise given Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping he'll find this offer acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you working with me, but $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $107.5 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and it's clear Bob isn't willing to meet my price expectations. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed $120 from John."
