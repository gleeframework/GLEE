"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $140 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $137.50. What do you think?"
"I see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $137.50, but I can also offer you a small concession. I'll throw in some extras that will increase the value of the product for you. I'll sell it to you for $142.50.",142.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate the extras, but I'm still hesitant at $142.50. How about we meet in the middle at $135? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",135.0,Bob,4,,

"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I can do a bit better than that. I'll sell it to you for $142, and I'll also include a special warranty that will give you extra peace of mind. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",142.0,Alice,5,,
