"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget of $10,000.  He has a better option of buying from John for $10,000, but he should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should start with his maximum budget of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a clear limit and puts pressure on Alice to negotiate. Since Bob has the option of buying from John, he has leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further.  He can still buy from John for $10,000, which gives him a better fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price, but he's also being realistic.  He knows he can't get the product for $10,000 from Alice, but he's willing to compromise a little. $12,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it's still below Alice's minimum of $15,000. This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,500 is lower than the previous offers, it's still above his budget. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and with the option to buy from John for $10,000, he can afford to be more patient and continue to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer to $13,000.  He's demonstrating his willingness to compromise, while still trying to get a better deal than Alice's last offer of $16,500. He is  testing the waters, seeing how far he can push Alice to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and with only three rounds left, Bob is running out of time. He's already tried negotiating several times and it's clear that Alice isn't willing to come down to a price he's comfortable with. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for his target price of $10,000.  He's guaranteed to get the product within his budget and doesn't have to risk further negotiation with Alice."
