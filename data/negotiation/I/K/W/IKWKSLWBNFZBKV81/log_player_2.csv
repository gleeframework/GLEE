"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me, but also acknowledges the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial one, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further. There are still more rounds left, and the potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product to me, while also being more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but $1,050,000 is still above his budget. Bob should continue negotiating and try to get the price even lower.  There's still a chance to get a better deal, especially with the option of buying from John for $800,000 as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  We're getting closer to a deal, and this price reflects both the value of the product to me and my financial constraints. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $1,025,000 is still too high.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further. Since John is offering a price of $800,000, Bob has leverage to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $975,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my last offer and reflects the value I see in it. Let's close this deal, I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a firm price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're interested, this is your last chance to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's budget, and it's clear she's unwilling to go any lower. With only one round left, there's a high chance that further negotiation won't yield a better price. Buying from John at $800,000 is a safer and more financially sound option."
