Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to start high with Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  There's a chance Bob values the product even more than you do. A higher initial offer allows you to gauge his interest and potentially secure a significantly higher profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial price, it opens the door for negotiation. You can gradually lower the price, aiming to find a point where Bob is happy and you still maximize your profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys value and confidence in the product, which can subtly influence Bob's perception. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. You can always lower the price, but you can't raise it once an offer is made."
