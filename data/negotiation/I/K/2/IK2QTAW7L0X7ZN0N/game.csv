"Thanks for showing me the product, Alice! It looks nice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think the product is worth more than that. How about we meet at $127? It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",127.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting stuck. I'm willing to bump up my offer to $115, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work, I might have to consider other options.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $127, which would be $121. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",121.0,Alice,7,
