Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will give you valuable information. If he accepts outright, you've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, you can gauge his level of interest and adjust accordingly.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
