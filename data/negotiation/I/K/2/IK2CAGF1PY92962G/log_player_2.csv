**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good deal, it's still worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially securing an even better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $675000.

**Reasoning:**

While $675,000 is a significant reduction from the initial offer, it's still above my desired price range.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target of $500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a more favorable outcome."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I'd still prefer a lower price, $650,000 is within my budget and a good deal compared to buying from John.  It's time to secure this product and avoid further risk of Alice rejecting my offers."
