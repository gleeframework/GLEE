,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for, but I'm open to continuing the conversation. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would give both of us a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I think this is a reasonable compromise, and it would allow me to make a deal",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000. Would you consider $975,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us",975000.0,Bob,6,
