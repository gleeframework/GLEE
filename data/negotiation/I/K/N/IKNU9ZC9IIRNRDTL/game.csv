"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident that you'll find this a worthwhile investment.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $2,300,000 is way above my budget. I could consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response! I appreciate your interest. While $2,300,000 represents the product's true value, I understand your perspective.  Could we consider a price of $1,900,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $1,200,000? That's a significant move on my part.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer!  I can tell you're serious.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This offer stands as long as we close the deal today.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me.  While $1,550,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  My absolute best offer is $1,300,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close today.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
