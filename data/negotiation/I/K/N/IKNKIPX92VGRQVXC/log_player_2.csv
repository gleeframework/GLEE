Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I have to make a living, and I need to make a profit. I can see that you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit short on budget, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I can see the value of the product is clear to you, and I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This is the minimum I can go, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen.
