"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting offer, but it allows for room to negotiate.  I'm starting high because I don't know Bob's value for the product, and I want to maximize my potential profit. I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $1,200,000 if this negotiation fails.  This gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm not in a rush to sell. I'll see if I can get a better price in the next round.  I'll counteroffer with something a bit higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still higher than my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, and it's getting closer to my desired price.  I'm going to accept it and close the deal. It's a good outcome, and it saves me time and effort compared to continuing to negotiate."
