You should reject Alice's offer because it's more than your maximum budget.  You have the opportunity to get a better deal, either by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product, knowing this is a fair price for both of us."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget. Even though it is a better price than her first offer, it's still not worth it to me. I'd rather just buy the product from John for $8,000, which is the best I can afford."
