"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering how much value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.  While $1,175,000 is closer to his desired price, he can likely get an even better deal by continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,125,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but I need to get closer to my target price. I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer to pay less, $1,150,000 is a good price considering:

* It's below his maximum price of $1,500,000
* It's only $50,000 away from his last counteroffer, indicating the negotiation is nearing its end
* It's likely Alice won't budge much further.  

Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal, and it's unlikely he'll get a significantly lower price from John."
