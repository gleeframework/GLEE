Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum.**  This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob.** This increases the likelihood he'll find it appealing.
* **It's a clear and concise offer.**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond. 

Remember, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response and your willingness to negotiate.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to pay closer to $10000.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still lower than what I want to get. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $10,000 is a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
