{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a better alternative with John, so there's no rush to accept an unfavorable offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price, which is $800,000. This is the price I'm willing to pay, and it aligns with my budget.  If Alice rejects this, I'll happily buy from John for the same price."

```

```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $900,000.  This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still staying within a reasonable range. If Alice rejects this, I'll likely go with John's offer, but there's still room for potential negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer.  However, I'm still committed to my maximum price of $800,000. Rejecting her offer allows me to try one more counteroffer before committing to John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm willing to move slightly from my initial offer but still pushing for a better price. If Alice rejects this, I'll happily buy from John at $800,000, as it's my final price limit."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and we've reached a point where further negotiations are unlikely to yield a better price. It's time to accept the guaranteed offer from John at $800,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget without further risk or delay."
