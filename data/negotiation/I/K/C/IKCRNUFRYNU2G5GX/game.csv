"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $13,500? This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
