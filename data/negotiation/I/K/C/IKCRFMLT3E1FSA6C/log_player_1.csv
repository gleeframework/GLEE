"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get as much value as possible.  I'm offering $10,000, which is still a good deal for Bob since the product is worth $12,000 to him. If he rejects, I can then adjust my price downwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to try and counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it still gives me a good profit and might be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
