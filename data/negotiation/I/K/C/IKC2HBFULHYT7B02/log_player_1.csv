Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate and still secure a profit. I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate as the product is worth $800,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm offering a price of $875,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also emphasizes that I am not willing to sell for significantly less than my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the best I've received so far, and it's only slightly below my ideal price.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him. It's a good deal for both of us and prevents me from risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price."
