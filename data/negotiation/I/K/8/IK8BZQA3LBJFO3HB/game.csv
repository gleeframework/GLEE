"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  To be fair, I can offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a good starting point for a potential deal, considering the value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's true value significantly exceeds your current offer.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's inherent worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, your offer is getting closer to a reasonable price.  However,  $1,150,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a good middle ground, and I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,050,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
