"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item that I'm confident will bring you joy and value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 and Alice's offer is exactly at your limit, there's no incentive to accept it.  Rejecting the offer keeps your options open. You can then:

* **Negotiate with Alice:**  You might be able to get a lower price from Alice by mentioning your alternative offer from John.
* **Go with John:**  John is a guaranteed alternative, and you have no information to suggest he's unreliable or his product is different."
