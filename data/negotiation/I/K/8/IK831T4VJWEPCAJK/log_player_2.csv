"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $120, but Alice is asking for $90. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds and can counteroffer to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $92. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's come down a bit, $92 is still above your ideal price point.
* **You have more rounds to negotiate.**  It's better to keep pushing for a lower price, especially since you have more time and the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $92 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $85, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $88. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting close to your target.** $88 is within your budget and only slightly above your last counteroffer.
* **You have limited rounds left.** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not wise to risk getting a worse deal in later rounds.
* **John's price is still higher.** Even if you reject Alice's offer, buying from John will cost you more. 

By accepting this offer, you get a good price and avoid risking a worse deal in the remaining rounds."
