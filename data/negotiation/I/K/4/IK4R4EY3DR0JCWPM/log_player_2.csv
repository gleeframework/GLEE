"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make it more attractive to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John is offering.  You can likely get a better deal by rejecting and seeing if Alice will counter with a lower price."
