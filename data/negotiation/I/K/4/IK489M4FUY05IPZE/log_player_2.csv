"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $120 from John. Since Alice's offer is $100, it's worth negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Offering $90 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum value. This gives Bob a chance to get a better price without immediately going too low and risking Alice rejecting the offer outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still better than buying from John for $120.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price, and he risks running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer is the most logical choice given the current situation."
