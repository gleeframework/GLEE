"Bob, I'm confident this product will be invaluable to you.  Considering its worth to you, I'm offering it at a price that's fair for both of us - $1,250,000.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is significantly less than what I need to make this worthwhile, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,050,000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you place on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need for a price that works for you.  While $925,000 is closer, it's still not quite meeting my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $975,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a compromise at this price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
