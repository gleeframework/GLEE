"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $14,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to $6,000."", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While my budget is $8,000, I want to start with a significantly lower offer ($6,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially getting a price well below my maximum. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, I'm trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to my desired range.

It's a risky move, but it could pay off if Alice is willing to come down significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is quite a bit below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, but she's still at her product's value. I know I have some wiggle room, and I'm willing to see if I can get her to come down closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. To be honest, $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $7,500? That would work much better."", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  Alice came down to $10,000, and my initial offer was $6,000. By offering $7,500, I'm not quite meeting in the middle, but I'm signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  While I'm getting closer to my maximum of $8,000, I still have some room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm leaving a little money on the table, indicating I'm serious about making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a fair compromise here. $7,500 is still quite low. What if we settle on $9,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Alice is using the classic ""final offer"" tactic to try and pressure me. However, I still have rounds to negotiate and a backup option with John.
* **Testing the Waters:**  I want to see if she's truly firm on $9,000 or if there's a slight chance she'll budge a little more. 

I'll make one more counteroffer before considering John's offer seriously."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. I'm very close to agreeing, but $9,000 is pushing it for me. If you could do $8,500, I'd accept it today and we can wrap this up."", 
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm acknowledging her ""final offer"" but standing firm at a price that works for me.
* **Compromise:** I'm meeting her halfway between her last offer ($9,000) and my previous offer ($7,500).
* **Urgency and Clarity:** I'm making it clear that this is the price point for an immediate deal, otherwise, I might have to explore other options."
