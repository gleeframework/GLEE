"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $14,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is quite a bit below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. To be honest, $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $7,500? That would work much better.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a fair compromise here. $7,500 is still quite low. What if we settle on $9,000? That's my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. I'm very close to agreeing, but $9,000 is pushing it for me. If you could do $8,500, I'd accept it today and we can wrap this up.",8500.0,Bob,6,
