"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $11,500?  That's a substantial reduction on my end.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. Could we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
