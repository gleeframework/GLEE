"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present an extraordinary opportunity for you to acquire a product that holds immense value to me. This unique item is not just a commodity; it's a testament to craftsmanship and innovation, with a personal significance that transcends its monetary worth. I believe its true value lies well beyond $1000000, but I am willing to consider a negotiation if that helps align our interests better.

Given the exclusivity and the depth of my attachment to this product, I propose an initial offer of $2500000. I understand that this might be a substantial amount, but I assure you that it reflects the unparalleled quality and the potential it holds for someone like yourself who appreciates its true value.

Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal, and we can discuss further details or adjust the price accordingly. I am open to dialogue and look forward to exploring how this product could enrich your life or contribute to your endeavors.

Warm regards,
Alice
