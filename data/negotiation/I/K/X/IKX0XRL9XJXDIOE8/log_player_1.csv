I'll reject Bob's offer. $70 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a fair price for both of us."

I'm still holding out for a better price. $80 isn't enough, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again."

I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering we're halfway through the negotiation process."
