"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm really hoping to find something in that range.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $175? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
