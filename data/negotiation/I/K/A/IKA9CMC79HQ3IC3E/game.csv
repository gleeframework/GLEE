"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me.  How about we start around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential returns it can bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer on the price. To be honest, I have a pretty firm budget in mind for this purchase. I could make a deal today at $900,000.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $980,000 is very close, but I need to stay within my budget.  If we can close this out today I'm willing to do $925,000. That's my final offer.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'll meet you halfway between $925,000 and $980,000, which is $952,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",952500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you're right, we are close.  I'm willing to move up a bit to meet you at $937,500.  Let's get this done.",937500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're getting a bit too close to the wire. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,9,
