"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $150 is a bit higher than my budget.  How about $110?  I'm serious about buying this, let's see if we can make it work.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
