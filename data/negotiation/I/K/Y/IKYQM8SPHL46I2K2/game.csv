"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to avoid selling it to John for the same amount. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
