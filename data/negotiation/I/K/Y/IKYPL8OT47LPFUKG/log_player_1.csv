Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still represents a good deal for Bob, who values the product at $1,500,000. 
* This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in a negotiation. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer based on his response and how much I feel I can push the price.
* However, I'm always mindful of John's offer of $800,000, which serves as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my target and leaves less room for potential negotiation.  
* I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* I believe I can push the price higher, especially given Bob's initial willingness to engage. 
* The risk of going to the next round is that Bob could walk away, but I'm willing to take that risk for the chance of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm counter-offering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $1,200,000, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $950,000. 
* This counteroffer shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my target. 
* I believe this price is still within the range where Bob might be willing to negotiate, given that he values the product at $1,500,000. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to carefully consider whether to counter again or sell to John for the guaranteed $800,000."
