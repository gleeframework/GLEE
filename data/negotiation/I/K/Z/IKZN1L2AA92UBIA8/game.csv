"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you outlining the value of the product. However,  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,250. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $9,100. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $9,100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,900. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it's the closest I can get to my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,900 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $9,050. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can come to an agreement soon.",9050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,050 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,950.  This is really my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",8950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,950 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,075, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. If not, I'll need to explore other options.",9075.0,Alice,9,
