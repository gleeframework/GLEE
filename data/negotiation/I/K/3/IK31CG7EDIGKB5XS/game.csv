"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
