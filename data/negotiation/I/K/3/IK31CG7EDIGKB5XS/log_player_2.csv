"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe you'll find it to be a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000) and leaves room for negotiation. It's also lower than the price John is offering, so it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few hundred thousand dollars."
