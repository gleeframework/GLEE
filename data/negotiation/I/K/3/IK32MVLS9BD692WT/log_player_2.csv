"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity given your interest and the value this product holds for you. I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a better price than $14,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price. Since Bob has a maximum budget of $15,000, rejecting the offer is a better strategy than immediately buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity.  While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. This still allows us to share the value it brings, while being closer to your original offer. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's counteroffer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially needing to buy from John for $15,000 outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price within his budget."
