"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because I think we could have a great partnership. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is lower than the $1,500,000 Bob would pay to John.
* **Bob saves money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $300,000 compared to buying from John.

While Alice's offer is still more than the product is worth to her, it's a good deal for Bob since he's still getting it below his maximum price."
