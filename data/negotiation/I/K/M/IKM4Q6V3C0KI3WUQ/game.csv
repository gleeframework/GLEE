"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle a bit, how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $1,300,000? This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
