# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $150 to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
