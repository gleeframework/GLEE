"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my limit. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  Let's work together to bridge this gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and your previous offers.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and I'm almost there. I'm willing to go up to $925,000 for the product. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already given you a good deal. I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a premium support package and a 3-month warranty, which would normally cost an additional $50,000. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on this product. I'm sticking with my price of $950,000, but I'm adding the extras to make it more attractive.",950000.0,Alice,7,
