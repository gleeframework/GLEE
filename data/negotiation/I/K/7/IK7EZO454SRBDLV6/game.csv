"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",675000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $675000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $625000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to stay within my budget.",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, Bob. However, I still believe this product is worth more than $625000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $650000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",650000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $620000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $630000.

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $615000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $620000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",620000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $620000. I'm going to have to stick to my original budget of $600000. If we can't meet at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",600000.0,Bob,10,
