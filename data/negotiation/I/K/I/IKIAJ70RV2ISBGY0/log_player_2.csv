Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm not willing to pay $10,800. I think I've made a good offer at $9,500, and I'd like to stick with that. However, I'm not sure if I want to continue negotiating with Alice. I'll consider buying from John for $8,000 instead.
