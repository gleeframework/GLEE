"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply not enough.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $750,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000. That's a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $825,000, but I'm still not convinced it's the best price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground here.  I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to other buyers.",800000.0,Alice,7,
