"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I'm motivated to sell, that price undervalues the product's true potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects a fairer price for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is still a bit much - how about we split the difference again and call it $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product.  Let's find a number we can both agree on - how about $1,175,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, that's closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you do it for $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to close this deal, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. How about we finalize this at $1,125,000? This is my best and final offer.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
