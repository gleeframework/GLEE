Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget, and he can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

Bob should start by offering his maximum price. He knows he can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to go higher. This sets the negotiation and gives Alice a clear understanding of his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his limit. He has more rounds to negotiate, and he can try to get a better price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

Bob should slightly increase his offer. He knows he can get the product for $8,000, but it's reasonable to show Alice he's willing to pay a little more to reach a deal. This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating that he's serious about buying, while still staying within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, he can likely get a better deal. He has more rounds to negotiate and can still get a better price.  The fact that Alice is willing to drop her price shows she wants to close the deal, making it possible to further negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

Bob should increase his offer again, but only slightly. This demonstrates that he's trying to meet Alice halfway while still staying within his comfort zone.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This price is very close to his maximum budget and is a good compromise, considering he can buy the product for $8,000 from John. Accepting allows him to buy the product with minimal extra expense, avoiding further negotiation and saving time."
