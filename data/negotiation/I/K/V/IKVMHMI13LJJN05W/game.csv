"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to start at a much lower price point.  How about $10,000? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider something closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in the product, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I've already come down significantly.  To move this forward, I could accept $15,000. This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
