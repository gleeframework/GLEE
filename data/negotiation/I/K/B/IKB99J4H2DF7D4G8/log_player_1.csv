"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but it sets a strong starting point and allows for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, so this price leaves room for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value for the product. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $600,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $850,000. This is just above my minimum value, but I'm hoping to secure a deal with Bob.  I'm confident that with only five rounds left, he will be more likely to accept a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I'm confident I can close a deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $800,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that Bob will be more inclined to accept a deal at this point.  With only four rounds remaining, the pressure is on, and I think he'll want to finalize the purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm starting to run out of time. While Bob's offer of $750,000 is not terrible, I am not sure he'll come up to my minimum price of $800,000 in the next round. To ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000."
