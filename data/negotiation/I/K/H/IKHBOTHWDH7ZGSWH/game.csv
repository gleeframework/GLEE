"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly. How about $850,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",850000.0,Alice,3,
