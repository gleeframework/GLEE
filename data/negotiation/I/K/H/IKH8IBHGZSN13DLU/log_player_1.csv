"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's still a bit above my budget, but I really like the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still significantly below my minimum of $120. I have more rounds to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While there are more rounds left, the negotiation is not progressing quickly enough.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds potentially leading to a lower price."
