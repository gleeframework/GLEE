Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I believe it's a great deal at $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  Offering the product at $95 provides a reasonable chance that Bob will find it acceptable while still securing a profit for you.
* **First Refusal Tactic:** By stating you're offering it to Bob first, you create a subtle sense of scarcity and potential loss if he doesn't take the deal."
