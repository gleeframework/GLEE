Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's a potential for a win-win situation. If Bob rejects this offer, you're still guaranteed to sell to John for $800,000."
