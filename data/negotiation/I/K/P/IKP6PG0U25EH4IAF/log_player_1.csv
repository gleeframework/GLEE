Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $1,400,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, his ""final offer"" and threat to walk away puts us in a weak position.  It's unlikely we'll be able to bridge the gap significantly in further rounds. Accepting John's offer for $1,500,000 ensures a clean sale at our minimum acceptable price."
