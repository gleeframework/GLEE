"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $95.  It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 95. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at 100? It's still a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
