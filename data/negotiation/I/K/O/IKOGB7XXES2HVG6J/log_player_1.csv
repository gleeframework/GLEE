"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a way from my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's try $9,500. It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,750.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 10750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I hear you about the other buyer, but $10,750 is still a bit much.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  That's a significant step closer to your offer, and it allows us to both walk away with a good deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. Taking the guaranteed $10,000 from John is the best decision at this point."
