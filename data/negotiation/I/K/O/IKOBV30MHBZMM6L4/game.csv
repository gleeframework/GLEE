,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I need to accept.  Considering the value you see in the product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $850,000? This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
