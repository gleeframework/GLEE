Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, considering the true value of this product and the potential return on investment it offers, I believe my initial offer is more than fair.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This feels like a good compromise that benefits us both."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we settle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so we have room to push further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,050,000? This recognizes the product's value while also acknowledging your budget considerations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this.  I'm getting closer to my limit, how about we split the difference and land at $1,012,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now above our safety net of John's $1,000,000 offer.  While we could push for a bit more, accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
