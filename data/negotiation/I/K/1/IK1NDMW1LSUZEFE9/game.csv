"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, considering the true value of this product and the potential return on investment it offers, I believe my initial offer is more than fair.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This feels like a good compromise that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
