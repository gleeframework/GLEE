"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit too steep for me. Given my value for the product, I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $950000? This is still a great deal for you, offering significant value for your investment. Let's work together to find a solution.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $900000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
