Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and persuasive, highlighting the potential gain for Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

*  This starting point allows for negotiation while ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum. 
* I'm not immediately going for the full $1,200,000 because that might make Bob less likely to engage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit too steep for me. Given my value for the product, I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $950,000? This is still a great deal for you, offering significant value for your investment. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $950,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position while trying to remain firm on my price. I'm emphasizing the value for Bob and suggesting a collaborative approach. 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm not willing to sell for $850,000, as it falls below my minimum acceptable price.
* This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while keeping the price closer to my desired range.
* By suggesting a collaborative approach, I aim to encourage Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $900000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is now within my acceptable range, considering I need to earn at least $1,200,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer allows me to finalize the sale without jeopardizing my minimum earnings. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opportunity Cost:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing the sale to him, as he might not be willing to negotiate further. 
* **Time and Effort:** Further negotiations could prolong the process, potentially delaying the sale and impacting my overall earnings. 
* **Certainty:**  Accepting Bob's offer provides a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement. 

It's important to note that this decision is based on a strategic balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
