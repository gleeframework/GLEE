Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. I think it's a fair offer considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Is there any wiggle room in your price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be comfortable with the price. Is there any flexibility in your price at this point?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $800000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $785000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at this price. Can you consider it?",785000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your target, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $785000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm counteroffering at $792500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",792500.0,Alice,7,
