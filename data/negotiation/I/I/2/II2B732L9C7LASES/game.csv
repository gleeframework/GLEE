"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1000000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1100000 for the product. This price is a fair reflection of the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
