Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1000000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.
