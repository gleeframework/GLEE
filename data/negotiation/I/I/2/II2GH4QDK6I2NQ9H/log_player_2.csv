"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also a great opportunity for us to do business. Let's start with a fair price. How about $85 for this exceptional item? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is a decent price, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $85 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim low, counter high:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) gives me more room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Appear reasonable:** While the offer is low, framing it as ""fair"" might make Alice more open to counter-offering. 
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help me understand how willing Alice is to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $70 for the product? I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a bit from her initial offer, signaling she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still room for improvement. I'll reject this offer to encourage her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $65? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount ($5) to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a good deal.
* **""Meeting in the middle"":** This phrasing suggests fairness and encourages Alice to continue negotiating toward a mutually agreeable price.
* **Still below John's price:**  My offer is still significantly below John's price of $100, keeping that option open if needed."
