Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $18,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $18,000 because I don't know Bob's value for the product. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By stating ""I'm open to reasonable offers,"" I signal flexibility and encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $12,000 keeps me from accepting lowball offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm initially disappointed Bob rejected my offer, it's clear he's willing to pay the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, there's no benefit to continuing the negotiation.  Here's why:

* **No Upside:** There's no chance of getting more than $12,000 from Bob. 
* **Potential for Time Waste:**  Further negotiations could drag on and potentially lead to more counteroffers that I'd ultimately have to reject.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John immediately guarantees me the minimum I want for the product.

Therefore, selling to John is the most efficient and risk-free choice."
