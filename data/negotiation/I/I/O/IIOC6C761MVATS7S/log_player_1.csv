**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point.  While we've made progress, the difference between his offer ($990,000) and John's standing offer ($1,200,000) is too significant to ignore. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
