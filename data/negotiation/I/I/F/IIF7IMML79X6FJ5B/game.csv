"Alice, your offer is still a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend no more than $800,000.  I'm willing to offer you $800,000 for it right now. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
