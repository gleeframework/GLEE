"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price that's 20% higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. This sets a high bar and allows me to potentially get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000. I will reject this offer and counter with a new offer in the next round.  I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering a price of $1,100,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, hopefully leading to a successful deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum desired value.  I'm not desperate to sell, so I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating in the hopes of getting a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,050,000. This shows that I am willing to compromise but still hold firm on getting at least $1 million for the product.  This price point is closer to Bob's offer, suggesting I'm serious about closing a deal with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired value, it's still a bit below the $1 million mark. I'm still optimistic that I can get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation, so I'll reject this offer and continue to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm offering $1,025,000, getting closer to Bob's latest offer but still holding out for more. With only a few rounds left, I need to signal a willingness to close the deal while remaining firm on my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum desired value of $1,000,000, I'm still going to reject it. With only two rounds left, I want to see if I can push for that final $10,000 to reach my goal. There's a chance Bob might be willing to meet me there, especially since we're so close."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum acceptable price and also within reach of Bob's latest offer.  I'm hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely. If he rejects, I'll have to accept the deal with John in the final round to avoid losing out completely."
