It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price. You can still buy from John if negotiations fail."

This is a reasonable counteroffer, offering a price within your budget and hopefully enticing Alice to make a deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to your budget, you still have room to negotiate further. You can likely get closer to your goal of $80 by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
``` 

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget.  It also leaves a bit of room for Alice to make a final concession if she's motivated to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While continuing to negotiate with Alice might get you a slightly better price, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further. It's now more beneficial to buy from John, as you're guaranteed a lower price and can avoid further negotiation."
