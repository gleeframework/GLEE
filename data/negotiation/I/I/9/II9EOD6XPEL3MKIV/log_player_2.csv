# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway. In light of this, we would like to propose a revised offer of $1,075,000 for the product. We believe this price reflects both the value of the product to you and maintains a fair margin for us. We are committed to finding a solution that works for both parties and hope this proposal will facilitate that outcome.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's revised offer of $1,075,000 is significantly better than John's offer of $1,200,000. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and potentially going back to her initial offer of $1,150,000 is too high. Accepting the current offer ensures a good deal for Bob while minimizing the risk of losing the product."
