Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately seems unreasonable. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a middle ground. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate and can be firm in my negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further or if it's better to move on to John. 
* I'll be prepared to counter-offer if necessary, trying to find a point where we both feel comfortable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's ""final offer"" is a tactic, and I'm willing to see if I can get him closer to my desired price.
* **John is my safety net:** If this round doesn't go well, I can still sell to John for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my desired value, but still within a range I believe he might consider. I need to find a balance between pushing for a good price and avoiding a stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Meeting in the middle:** ""Meeting in the middle"" is a common negotiation tactic that can make the offer seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language to emphasize that this is a fair deal and a good opportunity for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll be happy to close the deal.
* If he rejects, I'll carefully consider whether to continue negotiating or to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider $1,060,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $40,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, Bob seems firm on his offer, and further negotiation might stall the process.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time, and I risk losing the opportunity to sell to John, who is willing to pay my full asking price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.  
* I'm happy to have secured a deal that is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I made a good decision given the circumstances."
