"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting high, at $14,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob rejects the offer. I know the product is worth $10,000 to him, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, he'll see that this price is fair and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Bob is offering me $12,200, which is above my minimum of $12,000 and only slightly less than what John is offering. I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
