"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already met you halfway earlier, and I'm willing to give you a slight concession. I'll sell the product to you for $12,800. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is my final offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'll sell the product to you for $12,200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12200.0,Alice,7,
