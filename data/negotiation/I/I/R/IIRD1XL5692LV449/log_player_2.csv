# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this offers a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $900,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,000,000?
