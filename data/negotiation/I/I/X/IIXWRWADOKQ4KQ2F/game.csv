"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product could be a good fit for me, but the price is a bit high.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident it's a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $750,000? That would work much better for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $750,000 is still a bit below my target. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. This is a very good price for the product, and I think it's worth considering. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $775,000 is still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $760,000? That's my final offer.",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $780,000. This is a unique product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $780,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",780000.0,Alice,7,
