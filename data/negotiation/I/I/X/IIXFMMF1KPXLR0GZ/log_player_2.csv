"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is too high.  As Bob, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, and buying from John for $800,000 is still a better option at this point. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but rejecting the first offer is the best starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my target price of $800,000. I'm still willing to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting the offer allows me to send a counteroffer and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to a price I can comfortably afford. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, but my goal is to reach a fair agreement. While $950,000 is closer, it's still below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $990,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I've already made a significant counteroffer, and Alice's final offer is a bit too high.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $800,000. This ensures I get the product at my desired price and avoids further negotiation."
