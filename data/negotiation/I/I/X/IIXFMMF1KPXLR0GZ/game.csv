"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to a price I can comfortably afford. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, but my goal is to reach a fair agreement. While $950,000 is closer, it's still below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",990000.0,Alice,5,
