Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, I should aim for the highest possible price with Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,000,000 immediately establishes the product's value and my position.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 
* **No Room for Negotiation:** By presenting a ""one-time offer,"" I signal that I'm firm on my price.

While Bob values the product at $800,000, this approach aims to capitalize on the possibility that he might be willing to pay a premium for something he deems valuable and exclusive. If he rejects the offer, I don't lose anything, as I'll sell to John at my desired price."
