Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I'll start with a price that's a bit higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

Since Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, I'm not thrilled about it. However, I'm also aware that I could potentially lose the deal if I reject it and Bob decides to walk away. On the other hand, I could sell the product to John for $10,000, which is a guaranteed sale.

After considering my options, I've decided to...

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer. Maybe we can meet in the middle or find a compromise that works for both of us.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 11,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'm glad Bob is willing to negotiate!

I've thought about my previous offer of $11,000, and I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to try to find a mutually beneficial price. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 10,500}

I'm getting closer to Bob's original offer, but I'm still trying to get a bit more value for the product. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is sticking to his guns!

I've thought about Bob's latest offer of $9,500, and I'm still not thrilled about it. However, I'm also aware that I'm getting closer to the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($10,000).

After considering my options, I've decided to...

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a new counteroffer. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a price that works for both of us.

Here's my new counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 10,200}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me at this price!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'm glad Bob is willing to keep negotiating!

I've thought about my previous offer of $10,200, and I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to try to find a mutually beneficial price. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 10,150}

I'm getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($10,000), and I'm hoping Bob will meet me at this price. Let's see if we can finally agree on a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is still trying to get a better deal!

I've thought about Bob's latest offer of $9,800, and I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower.

After considering my options, I've decided to...

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000. I've already made several attempts to negotiate with Bob, and I'm not getting any closer to a deal. I might as well take the guaranteed sale with John and move on.

Thanks for the negotiation, Bob!"
