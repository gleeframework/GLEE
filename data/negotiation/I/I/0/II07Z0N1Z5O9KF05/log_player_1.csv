{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $115 is higher than Bob's $100 valuation, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate down if necessary while still making a profit above your $120 minimum.
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible:** By opening with a negotiation, you demonstrate a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a fair deal for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $110.  This is a compromise that's still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate further.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a little over budget.  Would you be willing to do $108? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe the product is worth more, and I'm not going to settle for anything less than $110.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make one final counteroffer.  If he rejects that, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $108 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm offering a compromise to Bob, hoping he will accept.  It's still above my minimum, but it's also close to Bob's offer, showing I'm serious about making a deal."
