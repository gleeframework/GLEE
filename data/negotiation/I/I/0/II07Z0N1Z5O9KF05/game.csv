"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a fair deal for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with this product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a little over budget.  Would you be willing to do $108? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it at that price.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $108 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",109.0,Alice,5,
