Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see how Bob values the product and if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price and  $90 is still a good profit.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price or losing the sale altogether."
