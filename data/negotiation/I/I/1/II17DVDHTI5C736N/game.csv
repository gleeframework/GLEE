"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
