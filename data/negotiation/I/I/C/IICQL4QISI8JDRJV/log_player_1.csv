Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $80, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a little low, but it's not terrible. However, I'm willing to try and get closer to my desired price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $120 and his offer of $95.  I believe this is a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $98. This is a slight increase from his last offer, but it's still below my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as I'm not sure how much further I can push him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to pay closer to my desired price.  I've made several counteroffers and it seems like he's firmly set on his price. At this point, it's not worth risking losing the sale entirely and getting stuck with a lower price. I'm going to sell to John for $80. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's still better than nothing."
