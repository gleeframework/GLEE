"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would allow for a fair deal for both of us. ",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $750,000. Would that price point be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. To show you I'm willing to compromise, I'm offering it to you for $800,000. This is my final price, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. Let me know your decision.",800000.0,Alice,5,
