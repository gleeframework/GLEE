Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest based on his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,200,000.  This is still a significant profit for me, and hopefully it's enticing enough for Bob to come up a bit in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While I'm getting close to my minimum price, I don't want to risk going lower and possibly getting stuck with a deal that's not ideal. Selling to John guarantees me a $1,000,000 profit, which is a safe and reasonable outcome."
