"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle, but $12,500 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be mindful of your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
