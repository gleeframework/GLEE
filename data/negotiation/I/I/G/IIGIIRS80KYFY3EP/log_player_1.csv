Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. 
* **Message:**  I'm being positive and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product.  I'm also leaving the door open for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a higher price than Bob's initial value:** By starting above $800,000, I'm setting the negotiation bar higher.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  The offer is lower than my minimum value, allowing me room to negotiate downward if needed.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:**  A significantly higher price would likely lead to immediate rejection, while this price point might spark a conversation. 

I'll be ready to counter any offers Bob makes, and I'll always have the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'm hoping to earn. I'm confident that I can potentially negotiate a better price with Bob, or sell to John for a higher amount.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I'm aiming to reach a deal that's mutually beneficial, but I'm also willing to walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $950,000. This is halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while reaffirming the product's value. I'm presenting this counteroffer as a fair compromise and asking for his decision.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise price, I'm aiming to:

* **Show flexibility:** This demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation and willing to meet halfway.
* **Signal my commitment:**  The counteroffer indicates that I'm still interested in selling to Bob.
* **Set a firm price:** This counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price, giving me less room to compromise further.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll reassess my options. If I believe a better deal can be struck, I'll make another counteroffer. If not, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, and I'm not yet ready to settle for anything below my target. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's a bit closer to my minimum. I'm aiming for a deal that's mutually beneficial, but I'm also mindful of my bottom line.  If this counteroffer fails, I'll reassess and decide if selling to John is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints,  $920,000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $935,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's my final offer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $935,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still below my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing that my offer is fair and final. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages a quick decision.

**Strategy:**

By offering a counteroffer that's close to my minimum and declaring it final, I'm aiming to:

* **Push for a higher price:**  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal and accept.
* **Minimize further negotiation:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm aiming to avoid endless rounds of counteroffers.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for a higher price. 

This counteroffer strikes a balance between pushing for a higher price and avoiding a protracted negotiation. I'm confident that this strategy will lead to a successful outcome, either with Bob or with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $935,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $910,000 for it. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $910,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Rather than continuing a potentially fruitless negotiation, I'm choosing to sell to John for a significantly higher price.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  my priority is maximizing my profit.  Selling to John ensures that I achieve my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price."
