The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is asking $200. You can do better.  It's best to reject and counter-offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $175. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.

While $175 is closer to your target price, you can still do better.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer might get you closer to your desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is now offering $165, which is very close to your target price of $150.  However, John is offering the product for exactly $150. There's no need to keep negotiating with Alice, especially since the price difference is only $15.  Buying from John is the most efficient and cost-effective option."
