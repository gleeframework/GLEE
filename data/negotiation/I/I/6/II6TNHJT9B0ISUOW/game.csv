"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer to being able to make this work. Could you do $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,350,000 is still significantly below the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,425,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
