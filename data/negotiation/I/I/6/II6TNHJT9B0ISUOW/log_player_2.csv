"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's starting price is significantly above your maximum valuation. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($1,100,000) than Alice's asking price ($1,750,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:** While starting low, I don't want to lowball to the point of insulting Alice and derailing the negotiation.  
* **Leaving John as Backup:** I know I can always get the product for $1,500,000 from John if the negotiation with Alice falls through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, but not enough:** Alice came down in price, which is positive. However, her offer is still $100,000 more than John's price.
* **Room for negotiation:** It seems likely Alice is willing to negotiate further.  I'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer to being able to make this work. Could you do $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counter-offer is roughly halfway between Alice's current offer ($1,600,000) and my previous offer ($1,100,000). It signals willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Approaching my limit:**  I'm getting closer to my walk-away point (John's price of $1,500,000). My next counter-offer will need to be close to that limit if Alice doesn't meet this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,350,000 is still significantly below the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,425,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice's offer is only $75,000 above John's price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns.  Alice might be willing to go slightly lower, but there's also the risk she'll hold firm, and I'll end up with John's price anyway.
* **Saving something is better than nothing:** Getting the product for $1,425,000 is still a $75,000 saving compared to John."
