Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal attractive enough to accept.  Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation creates a win-win scenario.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its worth.  This is a limited-time offer as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You directly address Bob and emphasize the exclusivity of the offer.
* **Value Justification:** You highlight the product's ""potential value"" without explicitly stating his maximum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (incentivizing him) while earning you a significant profit over your minimum.
* **Gentle Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust within the boundaries of your goals."
