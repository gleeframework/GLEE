Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $99 is slightly below my minimum but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a ""good deal"" and might entice him to buy.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still a small window to negotiate further, potentially settling on a price between $99 and $100."
