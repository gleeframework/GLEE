"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  While $850,000 is better than $900,000, Bob can still potentially save more money by continuing to counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get it for $825,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit and me to acquire the product at a good price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering you the product for $825,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a 5-year warranty and a personalized consultation. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $825,000 is a great price for the product, and Alice has even sweetened the deal with additional perks.  It's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price, and buying from John would cost him significantly more."
