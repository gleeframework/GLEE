"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $150 by me due to its unique features and benefits. Considering its worth to you is $120, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you like to purchase it for $140 today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $140 is closer to my maximum value, I can get the product for a guaranteed $120 from John. It makes more financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
