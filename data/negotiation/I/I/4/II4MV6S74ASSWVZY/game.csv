"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today.  I think it would be incredibly useful for someone in your position, and I'm confident you'd get a lot of value from it. I'm asking for $20,000 to start. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Could you consider something closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference - how about $12,500? I'm confident this product will be a great asset for me, and I'm serious about making this deal work.",12500.0,Bob,4,
