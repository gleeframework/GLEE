Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, giving you significant bargaining power.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, aiming for a price closer to his valuation while staying above your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation. If Bob tries to haggle, you can slightly lower the price while remaining well above your $800,000 safety net with John. 
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** This approach strikes a balance between confidence in your product's value and avoiding an overly aggressive initial offer that might alienate Bob."
