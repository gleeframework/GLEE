"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe we can come to a fair agreement. My initial offer is $110 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, and she's starting at $110. This leaves little room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows you to set the pace.** By rejecting, you signal that you're not willing to accept her initial price and open the door for counteroffers.

**Next steps:**  You'll need to formulate a counteroffer that's attractive to Alice while still being within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower price, but not too low:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your seriousness in negotiating. It also leaves some room for compromise. 
* **Politeness:**  A polite tone helps maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere, even with a lower offer. 
* **Openness to discussion:** The message ends with an invitation for further negotiation, keeping the conversation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $107.50 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.** While her offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above what you're comfortable paying. 
* **More room for negotiation:** There's still room to push for a lower price.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting, you're demonstrating that you're not desperate and are willing to walk away if necessary.

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to counter with an offer that's lower than Alice's $107.50, but still reasonable to her.  Consider how much you're willing to concede further and how many rounds you have left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm happy to pay $106.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 106}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  This offer is only a small decrease from Alice's last offer, showing that you're willing to compromise while still trying to get the best price.
* **Positivity:** The message uses positive language like ""happy to pay"" to keep the negotiation friendly.
* **Urgency:**  The ending phrase ""Let's see if we can finalize this deal"" adds a subtle sense of urgency, suggesting that you're ready to close the deal if she agrees."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your response. I'm willing to accept $106 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you and the negotiations we've had. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice has agreed to $106. This is a good deal for you.
* **Time is a factor.** You only have 5 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal with Alice and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.
* **A fair compromise:** While you might prefer a slightly lower price, Alice has met you halfway. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a price you can afford without further risk."
