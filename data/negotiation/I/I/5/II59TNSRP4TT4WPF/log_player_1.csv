"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. That's the most I'm willing to pay 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,200 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $8,700. This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8700}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm trying to be as frugal as possible 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is unwilling to budge further. Selling to John ensures I don't lose money and get my minimum acceptable price."
