"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price just for you, Bob. I think you'll really love it and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is higher than her value of the product ($8,000), it's still lower than what you'd pay John ($10,000). Accepting her offer saves you $1,000, making it the best choice in this scenario."
