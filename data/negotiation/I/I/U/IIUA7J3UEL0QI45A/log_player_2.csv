"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but considering its value to you, I propose a starting price of $135. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $135 is better than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm really looking for something closer to $120.  Would you be willing to consider $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum price point, but still leaves room for negotiation. He's also emphasizing his desire to get a good deal, which might encourage Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'll consider your offer and come back with a counteroffer. How about $130 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. There are still 7 rounds left, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this for $125.  Is there any wiggle room there?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his previous counteroffer, reiterating his desire for a price closer to $125. He's also trying to appeal to Alice's desire to close the deal by highlighting his willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your interest in the product, I am willing to go down to $128. This is my final offer before I consider selling it to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $128 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $120. Since Alice is firm on her final offer and there are only 5 rounds left, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $120. This guarantees that Bob gets the product within his budget, even if it means missing out on a potential lower price from Alice."
