Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. While there might be a chance of getting a better price through more negotiation, it's getting risky. Given the potential for more back-and-forth and the risk of Alice getting even more stubborn, Bob decides to take the guaranteed deal from John at $15,000. It's within his budget and saves him time and effort compared to further negotiation."
