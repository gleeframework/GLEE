Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he negotiates you down.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, we want to aim higher. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more than his initial valuation, especially if he perceives the product as valuable.
* **Below John's Offer:**  We know we have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John.  Setting the price below this ensures that if Bob declines, we still make a profit. 

By starting high but below John's offer, we maximize our potential profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
