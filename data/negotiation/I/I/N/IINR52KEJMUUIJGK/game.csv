"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,000, but I'm not budging from there. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go below $15,000. I'll give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $14,500? That's the lowest I can go.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but I'm on a tight budget.  I could do $13,500, but that's really pushing it.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting stuck. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $14,000? It's the last concession I can make.",14000.0,Alice,7,
