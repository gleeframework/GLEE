"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in buying it, but I can only offer $85 at this time. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $100? It's a compromise, but I think it's a good middle ground.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm grateful for your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still outside of my budget. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.  I'm prepared to go up to $90. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $90, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $92. It's still a bit above your offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise.",92.0,Alice,7,
