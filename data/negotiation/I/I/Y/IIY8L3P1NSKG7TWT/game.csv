"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1200000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're able to offer.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and what I've learned about your interest in it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I am unable to meet $1050000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. I hope this offers a compromise that aligns with both our interests.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from you. I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my needs. While I appreciate the extra benefits you're offering, I'm still concerned about staying within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1025000. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're able to offer while also fitting within my financial constraints.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1025000, but I'll throw in an additional 2-year maintenance package to sweeten the deal. This package will provide you with peace of mind and save you money in the long run. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thank you for your latest proposal. I understand the added value of the maintenance package, but I'm still working within a specific budget. I would like to counteroffer at $1020000.

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from you. I'm counteroffering at $1020000, but I'll throw in a 1-year subscription to our premium support service, which normally costs $50000. This is my final concession, and I hope you can meet me at this price. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,9,
