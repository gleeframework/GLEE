"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. $11,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. How about $10,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is the best price I can offer. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,5,
