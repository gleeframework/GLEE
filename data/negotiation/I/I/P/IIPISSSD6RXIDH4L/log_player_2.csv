# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

You can get the product for less than $100, so rejecting the offer makes sense."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

Alice is getting closer to your maximum price, and you're still saving money compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer is the best decision."
