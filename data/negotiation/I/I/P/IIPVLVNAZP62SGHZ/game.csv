"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to me, and I think you'll find it's a great investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $8500 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know if you're open to negotiation at that price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this represents a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $10200. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10200.0,Alice,5,
