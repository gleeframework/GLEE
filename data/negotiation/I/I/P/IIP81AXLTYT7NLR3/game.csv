,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  I could consider a price of $1,050,000.  This reflects some movement on my end while still acknowledging the value this brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
