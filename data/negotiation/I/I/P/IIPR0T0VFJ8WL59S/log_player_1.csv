"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more enticing.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at the absolute top of my range, allowing for some back-and-forth.

**Important Note:**  This is just the initial offer.  My strategy will adapt based on Bob's responses and the number of rounds remaining. I will be monitoring the time limit and the potential of selling to John as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  The fact that Bob made a counteroffer indicates he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate.
* **Time remains:**  With 9 rounds left, I have time to explore a better deal.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in round 3, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions.  I'll be careful to consider the value of the product to both of us, while also keeping my own minimum price in mind. I'll also continue to assess the risk of selling to John, especially as we get closer to the final rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is still quite a bit below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but not giving away too much.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still highlighting the product's worth to Bob, reminding him of its benefits.
* **Bridging the Gap:** $10,500 is closer to Bob's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**  I'm taking a cautious approach, trying to slowly close the gap with each counteroffer. I'm also keeping the time limit and the option of selling to John in mind. If Bob continues to refuse, I'll have to reassess my strategy and potentially move closer to his price or even consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is a significant step closer to my desired price. It's almost at the halfway point between our previous offers. 
* **Time pressure:**  We're already in round 4, and while I still have time, I don't want to risk losing Bob altogether. 
* **Close to Minimum:**  While $10,000 is slightly below my initial goal, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Balancing Risks:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but there's no guarantee I can get a better deal with Bob. It's a gamble, but $10,000 is a solid outcome considering the current circumstances.

**Decision:**  In this situation, it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale. The risk of further negotiation is too high, and the potential gains are not significant enough to justify the risk of losing a deal altogether."
