"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $90, there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $90 and my maximum price of $100. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than her original price. This shows she's not very flexible.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than my initial offer, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'm increasing my offer slightly to $87, but I'm still within my budget. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also determined to get the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer keeps going up.  This indicates she's unlikely to budge and wants to take advantage of my willingness to negotiate.  At this point, I'm better off buying the product from John for $100, even though it's more expensive, to avoid wasting more time and effort in a seemingly futile negotiation."
