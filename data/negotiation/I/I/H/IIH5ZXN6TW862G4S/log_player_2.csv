"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer because you can do better. You're willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice only wants $10,000. This means there's room for negotiation to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $11,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,500 to make this work.  This is a fair price, and it still leaves you with a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $11,500 is still a good deal for you, as you're willing to pay up to $15,000.  It's better to accept her offer and save $3,500 rather than risk further negotiation or buying from John at a higher price."
