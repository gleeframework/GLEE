"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying $12,000 when you can get the same product from John for $10,000.  You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This is a starting point, and you can adjust it based on how the negotiation goes.  You want to start with a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer.  However, make sure your counteroffer is still reasonable enough that Alice might consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering. You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate. This counteroffer is a bit higher than your previous one, showing you're willing to compromise, but still lower than Alice's current offer. You're aiming for a price closer to John's offer, but with a little room for Alice to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than John's offer. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially when you have a guaranteed deal with John.  You should choose to buy from John."
