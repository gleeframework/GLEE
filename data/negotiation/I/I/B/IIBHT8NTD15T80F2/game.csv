"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price, given my budget and the value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to be flexible. My counteroffer is $1,050,000 for the product. This is a compromise between our initial positions, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget for this product. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. My new counteroffer is $1,025,000 for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
