Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. My new counteroffer is $1,025,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above your budget.
* You are now at round 5, which means you are halfway through the negotiation process. 
* While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds.
* John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, which is within your budget. 

Therefore, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and secure the product at your desired price."
