"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering I'm ready to purchase right away, and it still gives you a good profit margin. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11500. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still slightly more than what I can afford. I'm ready to buy the product right now for $11000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it would allow me to stay within my budget and still allow you to make a profitable sale. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

This price is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
