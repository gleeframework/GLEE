Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $130 offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a deal, while still keeping me well above my minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob without sounding desperate. 
 
I need to be prepared to negotiate down if Bob counters, but I have a good buffer before I need to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good profit, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  There's a significant gap between his offer and my initial asking price, suggesting room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair price for a product you'll get a lot of use out of."", ""product_price"": 115}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer aims to find a compromise by splitting the difference between Bob's last offer ($100) and my previous price ($130). 
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to him, justifying the higher price.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While closer to my desired outcome, this offer still allows room for Bob to counter if needed, demonstrating flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $105?  That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly signaling that $105 is his ceiling with that ""best I can do"" statement. While I could push for a bit more, the difference between $105 and my likely next offer (probably $110) isn't significant enough to risk losing the sale entirely. Taking the $105 ensures a good profit and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
