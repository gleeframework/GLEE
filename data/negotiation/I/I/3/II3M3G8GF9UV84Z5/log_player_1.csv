Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is worth less than $150 to me. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is below its value. Could you do $135?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose $125 as my maximum offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting $125 is a solid gain over my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
