"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the value you've placed on it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and the value I've placed on it. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This price reflects the value we both see in this product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,500. I'll sell the product to you for $10,750. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is getting closer, it's still a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  Let's split the difference again and agree on $10,625. This way, we both get a good deal and can move forward with the sale.",10625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,625 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $10,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I've placed on the product.",10700.0,Alice,7,
