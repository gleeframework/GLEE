# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  You have room to go lower than $1,000,000 before you have to resort to John's offer."
