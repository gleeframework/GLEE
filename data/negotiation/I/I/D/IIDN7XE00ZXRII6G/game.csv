"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $800000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $900000 to make this deal work. This is still a fantastic price for a product of this caliber. Let's find a compromise here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $850000? It's a fair compromise that respects both our needs.",850000.0,Bob,4,
