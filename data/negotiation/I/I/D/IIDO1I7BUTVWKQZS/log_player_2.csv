"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it could greatly benefit your business. Given its value, I propose a price of $9500 for this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  Offering $8,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer but still leaves room for some negotiation. It's also a price that's within Bob's budget and leaves some room for profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $9,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's try $8,750. This would be a fair price for both parties."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.  $8,750 is a slight increase from his previous offer, making it more attractive to Alice while still leaving some wiggle room for further negotiation."
