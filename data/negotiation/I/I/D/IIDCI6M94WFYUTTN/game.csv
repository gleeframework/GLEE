"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that just yet. How about we try to find a compromise at $10,200? I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
