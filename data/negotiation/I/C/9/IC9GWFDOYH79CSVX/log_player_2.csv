"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $115. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating a lower price.  We have a strong alternative with John at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within a reasonable range. This gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Positive:** We maintain a friendly and appreciative tone to encourage a positive negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While we're willing to pay up to $100 (John's price), starting lower increases our chances of securing a better deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm really hoping to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, which is a good sign. However, $105 is still more expensive than John's offer. We're aiming for the best possible price, so we should try negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I'm glad we're getting closer.  Could you do $97?  That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Nudging Upwards:** We increase our offer slightly to demonstrate willingness to compromise but keep it below John's price.
* **Setting a Limit:** We introduce a ""highest I can go"" statement to signal that our negotiation flexibility is decreasing.
* **Maintaining  Positivity:** We want to keep the conversation going and hopefully reach an agreement with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower.  How about we settle on $101? That's a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $101. Since John offers the product for $100, it makes more sense to buy from John and save the extra dollar.  Negotiations with Alice seem to have stalled, and we're at the point where accepting John's offer is the most financially sensible option."
