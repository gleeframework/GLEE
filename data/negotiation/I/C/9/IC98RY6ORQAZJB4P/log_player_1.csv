Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you start with a price closer to your minimum acceptable value.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential"" helps justify the high price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone remains open and invites Bob to share his thoughts, fostering a potential negotiation. 

By starting high, you maximize your potential profit while still leaving room to secure the deal with Bob."
