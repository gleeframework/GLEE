"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's unique features and benefits, I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. My counteroffer is $920000. I believe this is a reasonable price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're looking to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $910000 fully captures the product's value.

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Bob, but I'm afraid $900500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the product's value and the concessions I've made, my final counteroffer is $918000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's unique features and benefits, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",918000.0,Alice,7,
