"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $13,000 is a fair reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This feels like a reasonable compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm confident that $9,500 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,4,
