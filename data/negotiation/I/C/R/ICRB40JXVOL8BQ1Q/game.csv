"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that initial price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000 and we have a deal?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a little too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value in this product. Let's find a sweet spot: $1,210,000. It's a strong offer reflecting its true worth.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
