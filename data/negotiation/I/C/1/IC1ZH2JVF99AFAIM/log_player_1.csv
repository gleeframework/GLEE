"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* $1,500,000 is a significant markup, but it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and his potential value for the product.
* If Bob rejects, I can analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still achieve a higher price.  I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm reducing my offer from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction but still above my minimum acceptable value. 
* I'm hoping Bob will see this as a compromise and be willing to meet me halfway.
* This allows me to continue exploring the possibility of a higher price while still being reasonable."
