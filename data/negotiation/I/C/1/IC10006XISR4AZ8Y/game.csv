"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. Let's make a deal!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great product.",107.5,Alice,5,
