Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. Let's make a deal!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $107.50. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $100, saving you $7.50 and avoiding further negotiation."
