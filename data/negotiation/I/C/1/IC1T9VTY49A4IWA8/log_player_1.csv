{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $15,000 is a strong opening position. It leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Value Statement:**  Mentioning the product's potential value to Bob can pique his interest and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open Communication:**  The message invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! You've secured a sale.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You'll need to analyze Bob's counteroffer.  
* **No Counteroffer:**  If Bob doesn't respond or makes a counteroffer too low, you have the option to move on to John and sell for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than your minimum value of $10,000. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's interest is clear, indicating a potential for a better deal.
* **John is a Safety Net:**  While $10,000 from John is acceptable, you can potentially get more by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  You'll need to send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your target than $8,000. It's important to find a balance between pushing for a better price and not risking losing Bob altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This reflects the value and quality of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Within Range:**  $12,000 is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the value and quality of the product reinforces its worth and justifies the price.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  The message emphasizes a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Bob to consider your proposal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You've secured a sale at a reasonable price.
* **Bob Rejects:** You'll need to assess the situation and decide whether to counteroffer again or sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is your absolute minimum acceptable price.  Accepting this offer ensures you don't lose out on a sale and meet your desired profit threshold.
* **No Further Negotiating Value:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a higher price.  He has clearly stated his maximum, and any further counteroffers could risk losing the deal.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting the offer allows you to close the deal quickly and avoid further rounds of back-and-forth. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  You'll need to finalize the transaction details with Bob, ensuring a smooth transfer of the product and payment."
