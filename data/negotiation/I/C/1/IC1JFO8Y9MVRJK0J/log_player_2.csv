"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and even higher than her own valuation. Buying from John at $80 is the most financially sensible option."
