I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but the negotiations are taking too long, and I'm not confident we'll be able to close the deal with him before the deadline.  John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price, and I don't want to risk missing out on that."
