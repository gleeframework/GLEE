We're still not close enough to my minimum. It's worth risking another round to see if we can get closer to $150."

While I could hold out for the full $150 from John, Bob's offer of $140 is close enough to my minimum.  It's better to secure a sale now at a slightly lower price than risk losing the sale altogether."
