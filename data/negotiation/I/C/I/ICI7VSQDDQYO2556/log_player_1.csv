Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount from my minimum:**  It's $1,000 less than my minimum of $15,000, which might incentivize Bob to consider the offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob makes a counteroffer, I have room to negotiate down slightly without going below my minimum.
* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  By offering $14,000, I'm still above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him a reason to negotiate. 

This strategy allows me to potentially secure a good price while also leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation in the hope of getting closer to my desired price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so I'm not under any pressure to accept Bob's offer.
* **Counteroffers can lead to better outcomes:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially secure a higher price.
* **Bob may be willing to go higher:**  It's possible that Bob is willing to pay more than $12,000, and some negotiation might bring him closer to my desired price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control over the negotiation and increase my chances of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $13,000. Here's why:

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This price is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. It shows a willingness to compromise while still remaining above Bob's initial offer.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $13,000 is still above my minimum of $15,000. This ensures I'm not selling at a loss.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I can either make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting increasingly lower and is now below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the negotiation might drag on further, and Bob might not be willing to go higher.

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000, it's strategically better to sell to him now. This guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the potential for further negotiation with Bob, which may result in a lower price or a longer negotiation process."
