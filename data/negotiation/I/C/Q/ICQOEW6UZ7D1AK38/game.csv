"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we try for something around $12,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and my minimum of $18,000.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, I am very interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. Would you consider $12,500? I think that's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to make the purchase.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer it to you for $13,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the value of the product to you.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However, $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last push at $12,750. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",12750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've already gone as low as I can go. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer it to you for $13,500 is too low, so I'll offer it to you for $14,000 is too low, so I'll offer it to you for $13,750. This is my last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",13750.0,Alice,9,
