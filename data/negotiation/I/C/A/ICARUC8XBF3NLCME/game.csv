"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $900,000 is still below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can finalize this deal at this price. ",950000.0,Alice,5,
