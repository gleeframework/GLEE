"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,200,000 is still too high. He can get a better deal by negotiating further or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his desired price point.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $900,000 is still below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can finalize this deal at this price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob should accept the offer.  While $950,000 is higher than his ideal price, it's still within his budget, and he's already come close to John's price. It's a good deal, and it's likely Alice won't go lower.  He could risk continuing to negotiate, but it's becoming increasingly likely he'll either have to settle with Alice at a price closer to her original offer, or buy from John."
