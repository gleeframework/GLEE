Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is a significant amount and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the value to Bob and the possibility of a ""mutually beneficial agreement."" This sets a collaborative tone.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price leaves space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 
* **Protecting my bottom line:**  This offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth negotiating further.  
* If his offer is too low, or if the negotiation drags on, I can always switch to John, who is a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, your price is a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1100000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While I'd love to sell the product, $1,100,000 is too low for me.  
* **Negotiation is still possible.** There's a significant gap between my minimum and Bob's offer, indicating room for negotiation.  
* **I'm not desperate:** I have a guaranteed backup offer from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a price that undervalues my product. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise that's fair for both of us. 
* I'll be careful not to get caught up in an endless negotiation, and I'll always have John's offer as a safety net."
