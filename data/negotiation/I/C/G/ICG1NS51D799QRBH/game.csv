"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I can meet you halfway at $13500, but that's the lowest I can go. Would you be willing to accept this price?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $13000. I can offer you a compromise at $13500, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. If you're serious about the product, this is my final offer in this range. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $13500 or higher to break even. I can offer you a deal at $13250, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13250.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $13100. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize my minimum price. I can offer you a deal at $13200, which is the same as my previous offer in round 6. This is my last offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13200.0,Alice,9,
