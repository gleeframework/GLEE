"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, thanks for working with me on the price. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little hesitant.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",10500.0,Alice,5,,
