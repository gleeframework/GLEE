Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate but ensures you're well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This price point is a strong starting point that likely leads to a successful sale, avoiding the need to sell to John for $8,000."
