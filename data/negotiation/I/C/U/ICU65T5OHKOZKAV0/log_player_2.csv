# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise between our valuations. This price takes into account the item's value to you, while also ensuring I'm able to earn a significant profit.
