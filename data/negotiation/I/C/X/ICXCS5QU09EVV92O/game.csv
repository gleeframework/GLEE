,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,000. How about we try $8,200?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, $8,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's a fair compromise, considering the value this product holds for you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
