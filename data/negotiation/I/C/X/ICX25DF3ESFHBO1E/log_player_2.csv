"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob. Alice's initial offer of $9,500 is too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still too high.  Even though she's moved closer to Bob's ideal price, it's worth continuing to negotiate.  Bob can still potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still hoping to stay closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to accept $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay close to your initial offer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $9200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still too high for Bob, who is determined to pay no more than $8,000.  Given that this is the fifth round and Bob is getting closer to his limit, it's more advantageous to buy from John at a guaranteed $8,000.  Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of wasting time and potentially getting stuck with a worse price.  It's time to cut his losses and move on."
