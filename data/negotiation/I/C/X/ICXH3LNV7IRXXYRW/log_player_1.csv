"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob than $12,000, so I'm hoping to get a good price, but not risking a quick sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a decent price, but I still think I can get closer to my target of $14,000.  I'm not going to risk selling to John yet, since there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with my counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is still a decent price, it's getting closer to John's offer, and I still have some room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer. This is a compromise to Bob's last offer, but still within my desired range.  I'm getting a bit closer to John's offer, so I'll need to be careful about the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're at a stalemate.  Bob's offer is now the same as John's.  While I'd prefer to get a little more, I don't want to risk losing out on a sale completely.  I'm going to sell the product to John and take the $12,000."
