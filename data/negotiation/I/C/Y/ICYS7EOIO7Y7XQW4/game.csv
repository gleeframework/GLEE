"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's unique features and benefits.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $875000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $825000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $850000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value and uniqueness.",850000.0,Alice,5,
