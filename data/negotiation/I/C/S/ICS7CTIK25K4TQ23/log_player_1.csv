"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit. However, I'm open to negotiation, as evidenced by my message. This strategy allows me to explore Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the possibility of selling to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can achieve a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. I understand this is still above your initial offer, but I believe it's fair given the value of the product to you. I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $950,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, especially with 6 rounds remaining. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a good backup option, but I'd prefer to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my desired price. I'm offering $1,050,000 as a compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my need to cover my expenses.  Let's try to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering $975,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the value of the product to me. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation with Bob is getting tough, and I'm not confident I can get him to pay $1,000,000. While I'd prefer to get a higher price,  selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I meet my minimum desired value. It's a safer bet at this point."
