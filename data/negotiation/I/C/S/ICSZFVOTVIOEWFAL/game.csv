"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget for the product, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more than that. My counteroffer is $1,075,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $1,090,000. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering the value the product brings to you. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to be closer to my target.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
