Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, without going below your minimum ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you get more than John's offer.
* **Act Confidently:**  By stating you believe Bob will find value, you aim to subtly nudge him towards accepting the offer. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. If he's a tough negotiator or doesn't see the value at that price, he might reject the offer."
