"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is significantly below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price that's reasonable for both of us. Let's work together to close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to offer $800,000. That's my absolute best price. If we can agree on that, we can close this out today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
