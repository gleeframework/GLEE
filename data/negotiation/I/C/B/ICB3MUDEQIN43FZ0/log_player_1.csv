"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer.  $600,000 is far too low for me, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is significantly below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is closer to my goal than his previous offer, I'm still determined to get at least $800,000 for the product. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price that's reasonable for both of us. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to offer $800,000. That's my absolute best price. If we can agree on that, we can close this out today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a great deal for me.  Bob is offering my minimum price, and it's better than going with John and getting $1,000,000, since I have to pay taxes on the profits. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
