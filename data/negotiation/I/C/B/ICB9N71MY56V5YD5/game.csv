"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $120, given the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a valuable product, but $120 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer. What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 just doesn't cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to close this deal,  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100. This is my final offer.  I hope you'll consider it. ",100.0,Bob,6,
