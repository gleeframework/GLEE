"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
