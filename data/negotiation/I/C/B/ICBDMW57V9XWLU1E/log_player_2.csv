Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider at this point.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,800,000 is more reflective of that.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering both our positions. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
