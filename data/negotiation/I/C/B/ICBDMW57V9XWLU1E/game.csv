"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider at this point.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,800,000 is more reflective of that.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, so let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering both our positions. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
