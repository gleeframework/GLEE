# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,000,000. I think it's a great value and I believe you'll really benefit from it. Let me know if this is something you're interested in moving forward with! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **You're getting a good deal:**  While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, the offer is still within your budget and saves you $200,000 compared to John's offer."
