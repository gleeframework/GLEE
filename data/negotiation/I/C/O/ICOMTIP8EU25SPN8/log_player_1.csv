I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  It also signals that I believe the product is valuable and I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a price closer to my initial offer.  It's also a significant amount higher than John's offer, making it more appealing for Bob to keep negotiating with me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and gets me closer to my ideal price. It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with less."
