Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal at this price, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is high enough to potentially entice Bob, as it's still a good deal for him, but it also leaves room for negotiation. This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is above my minimum, it's still lower than my initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $1,300,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $1,325,000? That's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still significantly more than my minimum of $1,000,000 and it's likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly higher price.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
