"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. I am willing to pay $950,000 for your product. This price aligns more closely with what I am comfortable spending while still allowing you to approach your desired price. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit higher. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground and get this done.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position and I respect your desire to achieve your target price. However, based on my budget and the current market situation, I am unable to meet your latest proposal at $975,000. I would like to suggest $960,000 as a potential compromise. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you and keeps within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",960000.0,Bob,4,
