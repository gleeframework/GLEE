"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $85 at this time. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
