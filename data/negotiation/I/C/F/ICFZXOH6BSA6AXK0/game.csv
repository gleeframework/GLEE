"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from the product's true value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, while also giving you a good deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $1,000,000.  Would that be feasible?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is acceptable.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
