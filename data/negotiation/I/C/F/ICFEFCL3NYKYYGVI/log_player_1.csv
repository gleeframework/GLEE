Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great fit for your needs. My asking price is $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone in the message to build rapport. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and its potential fit for Bob's needs to make him more interested.

**Strategy:**

This approach balances the need to maximize my earnings with the potential risk of Bob walking away. By starting high, I leave room for negotiation while still potentially earning more than John's offer. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer downward, but I can always fall back on John's offer if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price.  I'm confident I can get a higher offer by counter-offering. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, aiming for a middle ground.  If that doesn't work, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you coming back with a revised price.  While $1,250,000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the value of the product and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counter-offer is $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and expressing appreciation for Bob's counteroffer to maintain a good relationship.
* **Justification:** I'm justifying my price by emphasizing the product's value and the need to make a fair profit.

**Strategy:**

By counter-offering with a slightly lower price, I show a willingness to negotiate while still trying to achieve a price closer to my desired value. This approach increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement with Bob, while still leaving the option to fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is now very close to my desired price.  While I would ideally like to get closer to $1,400,000, the risk of him walking away or continuing to negotiate down further is too high.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a good profit.

**Strategy:**

This decision is based on the principle of maximizing my profit while minimizing risk.  By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and a respectable profit, which is better than risking a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even no sale."
