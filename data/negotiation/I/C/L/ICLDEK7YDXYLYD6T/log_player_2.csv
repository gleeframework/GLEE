"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product.  I think you'll find it's quite valuable. To start things off, I'm willing to offer it to you for $160.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round. I think the product is worth more than $160 to Alice, so I'm hoping to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I think the product is worth $120 to me, I'll offer to pay $100 for it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $100 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $140?  That's a fair compromise.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm still thinking that the product is worth $120 to me, so I'll offer to pay $130 for it.
