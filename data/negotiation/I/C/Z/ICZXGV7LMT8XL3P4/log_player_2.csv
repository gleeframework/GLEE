"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe it would significantly enhance your life or business. Considering its true worth and the potential benefits it could bring you, I am offering you the chance to purchase this product at a special price of $950,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a significant saving compared to its market value. I trust that you will find this proposal compelling and look forward to discussing the details further with you. Let's make this exceptional opportunity yours today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly exaggerating the product's worth to you. You know it's worth no more than $1,000,000, and her inflated claims are a sales tactic.
* Her offer of $950,000 is still a significant amount of money. 
* You have a guaranteed alternative: John will sell you the product for $1,000,000. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her to potentially reconsider her price. She knows you have an alternative buyer and might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale. Even if she doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything and can still buy from John."
