{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $885,000, which is only $85,000 over my target price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to pay less, I'm not sure I can get a much better deal from Alice and there's always the risk of her completely rejecting my offer.  It's getting late in the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from her.  It's worth accepting her offer to secure the product, given the value it holds for me and the limited rounds remaining."
