"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a fair deal for both of us, as the product is worth exactly that to you. Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer lined up who's also very interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You are willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, and John is selling it for that price. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer since you can get the product for the same price from John."
