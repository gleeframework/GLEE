"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  I'm still confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm open to a deal for $11,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still not quite in my range. I'm willing to make a final concession, and offer the product for $11,000.  It's a great price for the value you'll receive, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.  Let's finalize this!",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious offer of $10,500, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
