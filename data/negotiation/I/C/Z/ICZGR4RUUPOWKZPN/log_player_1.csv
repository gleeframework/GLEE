{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation of $12,000. This gives me some room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and continue the negotiation. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  I'm still confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm open to a deal for $11,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I think I can still get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still not quite in my range. I'm willing to make a final concession, and offer the product for $11,000.  It's a great price for the value you'll receive, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.  Let's finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've made a serious offer of $10,500, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is being firm at $10,500, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to go lower than that. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $12,000, I will choose to sell the product to John.  This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
