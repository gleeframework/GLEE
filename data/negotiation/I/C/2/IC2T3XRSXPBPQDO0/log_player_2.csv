"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $120, there is room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
