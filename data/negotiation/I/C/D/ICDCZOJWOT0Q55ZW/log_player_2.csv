It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  You can always buy from John for $100 if the negotiations fail."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice $95. This is a significant discount from her initial price and is closer to my maximum price.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiations."

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my maximum.  I'll reject this offer and try to get her down to $100 or less."

```

Alice is only willing to go down to $102.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with her when I can get the product from John for $100."
