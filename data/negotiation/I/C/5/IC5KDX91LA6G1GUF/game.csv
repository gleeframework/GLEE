"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I've been flexible in our negotiations, but we're reaching a point where we need to be realistic. $1,050,000 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000, but this is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
