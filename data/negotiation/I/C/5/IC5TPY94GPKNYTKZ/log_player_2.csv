"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Alice, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $110, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $112.50? It's still a great price for the product, and I think we can both be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112.50 is a significant improvement from her previous offers and is within Bob's budget of $120.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of a small price reduction."
