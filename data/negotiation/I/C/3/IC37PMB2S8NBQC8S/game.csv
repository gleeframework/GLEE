"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and its worth to you. Let's meet halfway.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I can see this is a quality product. How about $9,750?  That seems like a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,125? This way we both get a fair deal and can finalize the transaction.",10125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we settle on $9,937.50?",9937.5,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. $9,937.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,031.25? It's a fair price, and we can finally close this deal.",10031.25,Alice,7,
