"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price point for both of us. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth that much. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: $950,000.
