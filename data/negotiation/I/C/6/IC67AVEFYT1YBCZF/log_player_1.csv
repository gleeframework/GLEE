Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I know the product is worth significantly more to Bob.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a decent offer, it doesn't fully reflect the value this product can bring to your business. I'm willing to come down a bit to $950,000. This price allows us both to walk away feeling like we've secured a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good deal for me. It's close to my desired price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by trying to push for more."
