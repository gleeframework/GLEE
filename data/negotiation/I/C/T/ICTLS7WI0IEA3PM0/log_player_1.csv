"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but still below my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate and makes him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message encourages Bob to engage and avoid a quick rejection.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's enough wiggle room in the price for potential counteroffers, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **John as a Backup:** I'm mindful of John's offer, so I'm not overly aggressive in my initial offer, as I have a guaranteed safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That's a fair price and we can close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  I want to keep the negotiation going and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.  I believe there's still room to negotiate, as Bob is clearly interested in the product. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's counteroffer immediately. I have a backup if this negotiation doesn't work out.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, keeping in mind his willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a good compromise.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still above his offer and closer to my desired price range.
* **Highlighting Benefits:** I emphasize that this price is a ""good compromise"" and a ""great deal"" for Bob, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I use a positive and persuasive tone (""What do you say?"") to encourage Bob to accept the counteroffer.

**Strategy:** 

By making a counteroffer in this round, I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob while keeping in mind my minimum price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is closer but still a bit of a stretch. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,200,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is right at my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, this is a good compromise and allows me to secure the deal.
* **Time is of the Essence:** With only 6 rounds left, it's important to consider the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing out on the deal.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Although $1,200,000 is less than John's offer, I have the option to accept it, and it's still a good return for my product. 

**Next Steps:** 
I will accept Bob's offer, securing a deal for the product at my minimum acceptable price."
