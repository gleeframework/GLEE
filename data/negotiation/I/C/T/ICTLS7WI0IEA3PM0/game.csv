"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That's a fair price and we can close this deal today.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a good compromise.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is closer but still a bit of a stretch. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,200,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
