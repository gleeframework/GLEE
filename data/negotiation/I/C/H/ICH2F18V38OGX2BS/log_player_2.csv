"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to Bob, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $75 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, while still being within Bob's budget. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and encourages Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob has 7 rounds left and can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his previous offer and Alice's current offer.  $85 shows a willingness to compromise while still being within Bob's budget and leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. With 5 rounds left, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps Bob in the game and potentially leads to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to split the difference between his previous offer and Alice's offer. $87 shows a willingness to compromise while still being within Bob's budget and leaving room for further negotiation.  With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to start moving towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $88 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $87.  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's likely that further negotiation will not result in a significantly lower price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is within his budget and close to his target.  It's better to lock in a reasonable deal rather than risk ending up buying from John at a much higher price."
