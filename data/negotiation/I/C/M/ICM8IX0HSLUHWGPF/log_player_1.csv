Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $920,000 is still beyond my budget. To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to go up to $880,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to move forward. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $890,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

At this point, Bob is very close to our desired price. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and we risk him walking away entirely if we push further. Accepting $890,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of a lower offer or losing the deal entirely."
