"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's a decent starting point,  Bob can likely get a better price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still too high. Bob is looking to get the product for as low a price as possible and can likely still negotiate a better deal.  He should continue to counter-offer and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $920,000 is still beyond my budget. To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to go up to $880,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to move forward. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's final offer of $900,000 is lower than her previous offers, it's still higher than Bob's preferred price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a better deal by counter-offering again. He should aim for a price closer to $880,000, potentially even slightly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $890,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 890000}
