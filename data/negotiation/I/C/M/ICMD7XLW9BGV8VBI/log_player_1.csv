Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,200 as a final offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I've already had several rounds of negotiations. It's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly higher price.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and get the best price I can reasonably expect at this stage."
