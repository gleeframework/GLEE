Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I hint at the product's value to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, implying flexibility in my price.

**Why this approach?**

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings by:

* **Establishing a high anchor:**  The initial price sets a high baseline for the negotiation.
* **Encouraging Bob to counteroffer:** By offering a price higher than my minimum, I incentivize Bob to counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to make a profit beyond my minimum.
* **Keeping the option open:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can still accept John's offer, ensuring a minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the unique product. I understand its value, but my budget allows me to pay up to $12000 for it. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting his offer guarantees a sale and prevents further negotiation rounds.  I'd rather secure the sale at my minimum than risk Bob walking away or lowering his offer further."
