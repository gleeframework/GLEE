"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept anything higher.  Rejecting allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still firm on a price closer to $1050000.  That's a good deal for both of us â€“ I'm still giving you a considerable discount, and it's closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can make it work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get the price closer to his target of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  Let's try $1037500. That's a fair meeting point - we both move a little closer, and we get a deal done!  Let's not waste any more time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still better off buying from John at $1,000,000. While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still higher than what Bob can get elsewhere. There's no reason to accept this offer when he can get a better deal from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close!  I'm still looking to stay below $1,025,000. How about $1,012,500?  It's a fair compromise and gets us very close to finalizing this deal."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there!  I'm willing to come down to $1020000. This is my final offer - it's a great price for you and allows me to achieve my target.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob can get from John. While there are more rounds left, Bob has no reason to risk a counteroffer getting rejected and ending up with a worse deal than he can already get. It's time to cut his losses and go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
