{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum threshold ($1,200,000).

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1025000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Even though Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to sacrifice that much profit.
* **Negotiation Time:** We have 6 rounds left, and there's still time to push for a higher price. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe that by continuing to negotiate, I can convince Bob to pay closer to my target. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, attempting to bridge the remaining gap and secure a more favorable deal."

```
