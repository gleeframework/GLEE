"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still firm on a price closer to $1050000.  That's a good deal for both of us â€“ I'm still giving you a considerable discount, and it's closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can make it work!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1025000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
