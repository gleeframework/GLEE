"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe will significantly benefit your business. I am offering it to you for $950,000, taking into account its high value and the opportunity cost for both of us. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal. He has a clear upper limit of $1,200,000 with John, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I propose we set the price at $900,000. This offers a middle ground between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I hope this proposal is acceptable and look forward to your feedback.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's target, he's still aiming for a lower price.  He's already shown Alice his willingness to negotiate and has a clear upper limit with John, so there's still room to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to push the price down further."

I'm confident that $875,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  This price allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget.  I hope you'll consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to present a revised offer of $887,500 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that maintains a reasonable profit margin for me while remaining within your budget constraints. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and facilitates a successful transaction.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  This means that they are very close to an agreement.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a significantly higher price.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that is within his budget and only slightly higher than his target."
