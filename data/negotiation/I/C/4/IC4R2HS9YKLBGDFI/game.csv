,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really like the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $82.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $82.50 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $78.  Let's see if we can make this work.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $78 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $81. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",81.0,Alice,5,
