"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to sell. However, $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $155 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $160 for the product. How about we meet at $145? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to work with you.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $145 is still just a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $142.  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",142.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $142. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $150. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and it's still a good deal for you. If you're willing to pay $150, we can finalize the deal.",150.0,Alice,7,
