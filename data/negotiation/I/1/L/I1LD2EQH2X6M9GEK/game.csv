"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to consider my own investment in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for it. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be open to $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $975,000. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $975,000 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $950,000? I'm hoping we can find a number that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I can see that you're serious about making this work. I'm willing to meet you at $965,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",965000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $957,500.  This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while respecting my budget.  What do you say?",957500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close, Bob. I can see that you're making a strong effort to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but I'm not going to budge any further than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap this up today.",960000.0,Alice,9,
