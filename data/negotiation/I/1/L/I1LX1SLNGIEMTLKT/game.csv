"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think!",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is my final offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
