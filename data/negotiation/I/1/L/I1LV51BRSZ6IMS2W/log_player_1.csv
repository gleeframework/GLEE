Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. Since I can sell the product to John for $80, I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll still make a decent profit. However, there's potential for a higher profit if Bob values the product more and accepts my offer."
