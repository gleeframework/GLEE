"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $100, which is within my budget and a good deal. It's better to accept this offer than risk a further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or the need to buy from John."
