"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000, and John is selling the product for $10,000,  it's best to reject Alice's offer. There's no benefit to buying from Alice at the same price."
