"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150 from John, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer gives you leverage to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation of $100. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and hopefully encourages her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $140 to $130. This is a good price considering my maximum budget is $150. Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that is within my budget and saves me $20 compared to buying from John."
