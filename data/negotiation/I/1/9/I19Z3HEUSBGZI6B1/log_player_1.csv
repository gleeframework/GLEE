"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a fair offer, considering the product is worth $150 to Bob, and it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better price than $100 from John, so I'm willing to negotiate with Bob for a while."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than $100 from John, I'm not ready to accept yet. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $130.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a decent price for me, and I believe Bob will be more likely to accept this offer."
