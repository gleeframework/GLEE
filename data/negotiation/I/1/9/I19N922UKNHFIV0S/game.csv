"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $825000?",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable compromise would be $875000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances. Can you consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to accept this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to sell the product for $900000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make one final offer of $825000. If you're willing to accept this price, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",825000.0,Bob,6,
