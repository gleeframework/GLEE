Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 allows some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range very profitable for you.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly without trying to negotiate too much. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiating style or financial limitations. 
* There's a risk Bob might find the price too high and reject it outright. However, with the information provided, it's a calculated risk to maximize potential profit."
