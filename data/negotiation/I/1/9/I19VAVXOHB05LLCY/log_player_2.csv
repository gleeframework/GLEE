"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a fantastic deal for you, and I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to get a sense of Alice's flexibility. I want to leave room for negotiation while staying within a reasonable range of my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a limited budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still too high for me. I'll counter with a price closer to my budget, but leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for considering my budget, Alice.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $75?  That's a fair price and would allow me to purchase it today."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

I've increased my offer significantly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. However, $75 keeps me well within my budget and leaves some room for a final counteroffer from Alice if she's not quite ready to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above your $75 offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but $100 is still above my budget. I'll hold firm and see if she's willing to come down a bit more.  I'm getting close to the point where buying from John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $100 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $80? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

I'm sticking to my maximum budget. This offer lets Alice know I'm serious but also that I have an alternative if we can't agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $80 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. Let's try $110. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to meet my budget. While she might come down a little more, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price that fits my budget perfectly."
