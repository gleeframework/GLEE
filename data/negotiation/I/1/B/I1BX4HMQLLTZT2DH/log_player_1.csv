Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let me know what you think.
