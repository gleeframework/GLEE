"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's a fantastic deal for you at $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. $120 is still above your maximum price of $150, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you consider $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $110, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. How about we meet at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're still trying to save as much as possible. $115 is still higher than your ideal price. There's still room to negotiate, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to come down a bit, Alice.  $110 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?"", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to find a sweet spot for both of us, Bob. I can do $118, but I think I can do even better than that. How about we meet at $120, but I'll throw in a small discount for you - let's say $119.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $119.50 is closer to your ideal price, it's still above your maximum. You have 5 rounds remaining, so it's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a solution. However, $119.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $115, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. I can do $117, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. Let me think for a moment... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already rejected Alice's offer of $119.50, and it seems she's becoming more flexible. At $117, you're only $2 above your ideal price, and with only 3 rounds remaining, it's likely you won't get a better deal.  It's a good compromise to secure the product without risking getting stuck with John's higher price."
