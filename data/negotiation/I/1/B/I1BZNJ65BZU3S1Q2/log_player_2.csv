``` 
Alice's offer is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to lower the price significantly. It's a starting point, and I'm prepared to negotiate further depending on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still some wiggle room. I'll reject this offer and propose something closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to my maximum but trying to stay firm and get a good deal. Let's see if Alice accepts this compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $82. It's a great price, and I think it's a good balance between what I need and what you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet me halfway, and $82 is a reasonable price. It's close enough to my target, and further haggling might make me lose the deal."
