"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is excellent, the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $820,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $760,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can sell it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",800000.0,Alice,5,
