Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, we still have negotiating room and time.  Bob stating it's his ""highest price"" could be a negotiation tactic. We'll try to push him a bit further while staying aware of our bottom line and John's standing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair deal. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this product benefit your business."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  We're getting closer to the halfway point in negotiations. Offering $1,000,000 creates a strong sense of ""meeting in the middle"" and might feel more palatable to Bob.
*  By framing it as a ""final offer"" we add a touch of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to accept.
*  We are still well above John's offer, keeping our options open if Bob remains inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to see some more movement from you. I'm not willing to go any higher than this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has now offered $950,000 twice, indicating this is likely his true ceiling.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate risks souring the deal and pushing Bob away entirely. The potential gains from further negotiation are likely small.
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal sooner allows us to allocate time and resources elsewhere.

Accepting $950,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing Bob entirely."
