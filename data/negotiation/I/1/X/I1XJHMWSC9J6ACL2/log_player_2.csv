"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** $140
* **John's Offer:** $150

Since Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to you, it's better to reject her offer. You can still get the product from John for your maximum value."
