{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,500. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, making any price below that potentially beneficial for him.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000 (to John).
* **Negotiation Space:** This creates a negotiation space of $4,000 ($12,000 - $8,000).
* **Target Price:** Aiming for a price close to the middle of the negotiation space ($10,000) is a good starting point.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning a ""one-time offer,"" you subtly encourage Bob to make a decision without excessive haggling.

Offering the product at $10,500 gives Bob a good deal while still securing a significant profit for you ($2,500 above your minimum)."
