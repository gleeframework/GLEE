"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I know it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm thinking of a price around $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I've done some research and I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is just too low for me. This product has a lot of value and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,200 is still too low for me.  Would you consider $8,750?  That's a fair compromise, I believe.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $8,750 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'm willing to pay $8,350 for the product.",8350.0,Bob,6,
