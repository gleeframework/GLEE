Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counter with a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counter with a price of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly on price.  She's still offering the product for considerably more than John's offer of $800,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price Bob finds acceptable. Buying from John ensures Bob stays within his budget."
