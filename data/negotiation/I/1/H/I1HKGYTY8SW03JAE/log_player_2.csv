"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations. Given its value and potential impact on your projects, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $11,000. This is a special opportunity tailored specifically for you, considering the high worth of $12,000 this product holds for you. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aware that the product is worth $12,000 to you and is trying to secure a profit by offering a ""discount"" that's still above her own valuation. By rejecting her offer, you push her to potentially lower the price further. If she doesn't, you're not losing anything because you can always buy from John at your maximum budget."
