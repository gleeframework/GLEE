"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't go above $10,000 for it. Would you be able to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000 for this product. Would you be able to lower the price further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a significantly better deal. Accepting his offer means losing out on potential profit. Selling to John for $10,000 is the most logical choice at this point to ensure a guaranteed, acceptable profit."
