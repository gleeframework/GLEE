,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $950,000 is a bit too far below my expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and your potential profit.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. Can you consider it?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $975,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's try $1,000,000. This price allows you a good profit margin, and it's a fair compromise for me.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
