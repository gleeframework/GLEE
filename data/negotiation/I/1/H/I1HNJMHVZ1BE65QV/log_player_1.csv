This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum of $1,200,000, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and get the sale done, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $1,200,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a middle ground that benefits both of us."
