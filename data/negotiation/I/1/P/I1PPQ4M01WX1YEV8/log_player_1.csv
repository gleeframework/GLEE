Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It also allows room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $150 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial offer. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I hope this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $160. This is a good compromise that allows me to sell the product at a price higher than my minimum, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a lower price."
