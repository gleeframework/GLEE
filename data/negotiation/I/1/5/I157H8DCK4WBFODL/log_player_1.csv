Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't helpful in this scenario.**  We know Bob values the product at $80, but we can't access that information during the negotiation. We only know our minimum price and that we have another buyer.
* **Starting high anchors the negotiation.** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets a higher point for further negotiation if we choose to counter-offer.  
* **We want to maximize profit.** Since we have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, starting higher than that gives us a chance to earn even more.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might accept the $170 offer even if it's above his valuation. People sometimes overpay due to various factors like perceived value, urgency, or lack of information."
