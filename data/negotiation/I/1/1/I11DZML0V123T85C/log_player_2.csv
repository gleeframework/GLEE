"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal for you. It's lower than John's price and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. Accepting the offer saves you money and gets you the product."
