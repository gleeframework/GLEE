"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product to you, while also being more in line with what I'm looking for.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
