"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $13,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to meet you closer to your number.  How about we settle on $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While $11,500 is closer to my target, it's still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I understand you want to find a fair price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
