Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, but let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering the product at $150, Alice signals that she's open to discussion.  Bob might try to negotiate the price down, and Alice can then consider countering or accepting if the offer remains above her $120 minimum.
* **Confidence:**  The tone of the message is confident and suggests that Alice believes in the value of her product.

**Important Note:**  While John represents a guaranteed $120, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome."
