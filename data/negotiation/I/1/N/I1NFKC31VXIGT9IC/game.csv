"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product represents is truly unique. I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but $1,400,000 is too low. Would you consider $1,650,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the willingness to compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,600,000. This offer represents a significant investment for you, but I'm confident the returns it will generate will make it worthwhile. Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
