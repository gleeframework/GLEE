"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you.  I'm offering it to you for $850,000.  This is a price that reflects its true worth while also offering a slight advantage to you. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further.  If not, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
