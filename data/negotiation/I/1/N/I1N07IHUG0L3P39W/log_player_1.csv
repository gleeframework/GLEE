Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $100 initially leaves room for negotiation and maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Fair Offer:** $100 is a decent price that's still within Bob's perceived value of the product.  
* **Open-Ended:** The message encourages Bob to respond and start a conversation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, you've successfully made the sale!
* If Bob rejects, you'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of your own. Remember, you can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate but also show that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.  This gives me leverage to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will now make a counteroffer to Bob.  I'll likely aim for a price between his offer of $85 and my minimum acceptable price of $80. This will show flexibility while still trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a little lower than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  Offering $90 represents a compromise between Bob's offer ($85) and my desired price ($80 + some profit).  This shows flexibility while still being close to my target.
* **Positive Messaging:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" and avoids being overly aggressive, which could make Bob less willing to negotiate further.
* **Reasoning:** I've provided a reason (splitting the difference) for my counteroffer, which adds legitimacy to my position.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a successful sale.
* If Bob rejects, I will have to analyze the situation:
    * If he makes a counteroffer close to my target price, I might consider accepting.
    * If his offer is too low, I might make another counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $88?  I think that's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $88 is only $8 away from my minimum acceptable price of $80.  This is a good deal, especially considering Bob is ready to buy today.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate risks delaying the sale.  It's possible Bob could change his mind, or another buyer might emerge. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even though I'm accepting a slightly lower price, establishing a good relationship with Bob could lead to future sales where I might be able to get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
