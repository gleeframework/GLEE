Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice has reached her lowest price, which is also a fair deal considering your maximum budget. There's little chance of getting a better price from her.  It's best to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
