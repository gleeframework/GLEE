"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $13,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $9,500? That's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $9,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher return. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,250?  This would be a fair compromise.",11250.0,Alice,5,
