Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $9,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher return. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,250?  This would be a fair compromise.

Alice is very unlikely to come down significantly from here. It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer to ensure you stay within your budget."
