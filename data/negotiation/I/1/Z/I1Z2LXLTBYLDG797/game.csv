"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider purchasing it for something closer to $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $120 is still a bit too steep for me, how about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
