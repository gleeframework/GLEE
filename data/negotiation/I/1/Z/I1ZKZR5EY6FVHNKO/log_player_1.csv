Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $90, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$90 offer:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel valued as a potential buyer. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking Bob's opinion, rather than making a hard demand. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest while also leaving the possibility for a counteroffer. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Proceed to next round:**  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, especially since he expressed interest in the product.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  I'll use the next round to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to reach a compromise that benefits both of us. 

This approach allows me to maximize my potential earnings while maintaining the possibility of a successful sale to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm happy to hear you're interested.  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $85, which is midway between Bob's offer of $75 and my initial offer of $90. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a rationale for the counteroffer, emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation productive.

This strategy allows me to move closer to my desired price while acknowledging Bob's perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $85. Would you be willing to consider $82? I'm really interested in the product, but I want to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  $82 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's a good compromise considering Bob's willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Closing the deal:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away completely. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $80 would result in less profit than accepting Bob's offer. 

This approach allows me to maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
