"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While I value your interest, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this counteroffer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,250?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for you.  What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's my final offer. Can you consider this compromise?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's try $11,000 one more time.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Think about it â€“  you'd be getting a great product at a price closer to your initial offer.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I've already gone as high as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and $11,000, which would be $10,875. This is my final offer. Can you reconsider?",10875.0,Bob,8,
