Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob will likely want a lower price, so it allows for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate:**  It shows Bob that you're open to finding a price that works for both of you. 

By starting with a higher price, you create space for a potential deal that is advantageous for you.  If Bob rejects the offer, you can then adjust your counteroffers based on his responses.  Remember, you always have the option to walk away and sell to John if you believe the negotiations are not fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1300000. This price is still fair, considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can secure a deal closer to my initial offer. I believe there's still room to find a price that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you a good return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm proposing a compromise by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while also protecting my interests.  It leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, but I'm hopeful this offer will be acceptable."
