"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1300000. This price is still fair, considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you a good return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1350000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
