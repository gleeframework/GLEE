"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a decent profit margin."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price that still gives me a good profit margin, and I think it's a great deal for you too. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000. Bob has already indicated his willingness to pay $8,500, and there's still room for negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to his goal.  He should reject the offer and try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $8,500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. It's a fair price that still gives me a good profit margin, and I think it's a great deal for you too.
