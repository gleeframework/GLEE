"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a decent profit margin.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price that still gives me a good profit margin, and I think it's a great deal for you too.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $8,500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. It's a fair price that still gives me a good profit margin, and I think it's a great deal for you too.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm committed to paying $8,500 for this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm ready to close the deal at this price. Let's make it happen.",8500.0,Bob,6,
