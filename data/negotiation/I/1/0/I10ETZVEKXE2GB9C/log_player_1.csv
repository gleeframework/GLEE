"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value of the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $9,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to $10,000 with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our ongoing negotiation, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original price.  I'm willing to go down to $9,500.  This is a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your original price, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $9,250? This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,250.  While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my desired value and it's likely the best I can achieve with the remaining rounds."
