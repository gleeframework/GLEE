"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value of the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $9,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our ongoing negotiation, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original price.  I'm willing to go down to $9,500.  This is a good compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your original price, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $9,250? This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price.",9250.0,Bob,4,
