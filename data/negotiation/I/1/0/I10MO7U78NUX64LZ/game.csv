"I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500. This is a reasonable price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $12,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12250.0,Alice,5,
