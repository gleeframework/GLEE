"I appreciate your offer, Alice, and I'm interested in purchasing the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'm proposing a price of $1050000. This is still a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a small adjustment to your previous offer. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to make one final compromise and propose a price of $980000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $980000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not comfortable going any further. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm proposing a final offer of $1020000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
