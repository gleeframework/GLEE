"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? It's a good price for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $925,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $875,000.  Would that work for you?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $875,000 just isn't quite there yet.  How about we compromise at $900,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you considering the value of this product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
