"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,800. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $9,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,700. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9700.0,Alice,5,
