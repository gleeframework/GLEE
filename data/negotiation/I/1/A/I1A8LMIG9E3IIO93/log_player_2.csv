"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $900,000 is still too high. You have room to negotiate and can potentially save a significant amount.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a low offer, knowing Alice is unlikely to accept it immediately. This establishes a starting point for negotiation and lets Alice know I'm serious about a significant discount.  I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between our values, giving us both room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my target, I'm not willing to pay that much yet. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap. I'm confident that I can get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious about buying the product. $825,000 is closer to her value and demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise.  This should encourage her to consider a deal, while still allowing me to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can convince her to drop the price further. Buying from John at this point would be a significant loss for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm continuing to increase my offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet Alice halfway.  $850,000 is still a good deal for me, but it's getting closer to her value. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept the offer and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to my desired price point, I'm still not willing to pay that much.  I'm determined to save as much money as possible and believe I can still get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation.  If I accept now, I'll only save $30,000 compared to buying from John. I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm continuing to raise my offer, but still staying within a price range that allows me to save a considerable amount compared to buying from John. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Alice to accept and close the deal.  If she rejects, I'm running out of rounds and may need to consider buying from John."
