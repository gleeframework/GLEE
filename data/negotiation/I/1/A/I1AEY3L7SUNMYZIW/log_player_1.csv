``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'll be able to adjust my price based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $10,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $17,500. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but it's still well above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up on his offer and we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still too low, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
