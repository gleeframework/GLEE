"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $800000 is above my initial budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing for $600000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for considering our product, Bob. We understand your position and would like to offer a compromise. How about we set the price at $700000? This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while being more accessible within your budget.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700000 is still a bit high for me.  To reach an agreement, I'm prepared to offer $650000. This represents a significant step closer to your previous offer and allows for a reasonable profit while staying within my budget.",650000.0,Bob,4,
