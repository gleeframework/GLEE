Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation, allowing you to potentially get closer to your desired price while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1375000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1,360,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's not likely that Bob will budge much further.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees I get my desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower final price."
