""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $12,000 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also makes him feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down even slightly.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $11,999 seems significantly lower than $12,000 in the mind of the buyer, even though the difference is only $1.

This offer aims to maximize potential profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to consider seriously."
