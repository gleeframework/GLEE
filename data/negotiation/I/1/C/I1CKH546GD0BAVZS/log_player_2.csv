"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, even at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is very close to her valuation, leaving little room for negotiation. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so rejecting this offer makes sense."
