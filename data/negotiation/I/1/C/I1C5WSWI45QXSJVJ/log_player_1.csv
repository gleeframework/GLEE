Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

Here's why I chose this offer:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is more than your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $1,150,000 is less than the $1,200,000 the product is worth to Bob, giving him a potential benefit from buying.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a $50,000 buffer in case Bob wants to negotiate a lower price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still being attractive to Bob."
