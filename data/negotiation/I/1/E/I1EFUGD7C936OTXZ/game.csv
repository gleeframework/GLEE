"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm still very interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $16,000 to make this worthwhile. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still too low for me.  I'm sticking to my minimum of $15,000.  It's a fair price for a product that you value at the same amount. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to go above $13,500. I'm willing to compromise at $13,000, but I need you to meet me halfway. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
