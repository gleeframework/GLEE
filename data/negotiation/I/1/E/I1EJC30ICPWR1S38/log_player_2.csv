"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Would you like to make an offer or accept my price of $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  Although $900,000 is less than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **You have a better option:**  You can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is closer to your maximum budget. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate further with her or proceed with John."
