"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good investment for you. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1000000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still aiming for $1000000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle at $950000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't regret.  Let's finalize this transaction.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still stretching my budget. I'm committed to getting this deal done, but I need to stay within my limits.  I'm prepared to pay $900000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,6,
