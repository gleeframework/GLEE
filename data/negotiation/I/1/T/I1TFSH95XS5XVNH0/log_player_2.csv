"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are aiming for a price closer to $800,000, and $1,000,000 is still too high. A counteroffer will give you a chance to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still gives you a significant discount and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. Rejecting this offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your target and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $925,000 is getting very close to your budget. It's also a reasonable compromise from both parties, and pushing harder could risk the deal completely.  At this point, accepting the offer is the safest bet to secure the product."
