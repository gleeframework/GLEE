"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value to you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still gives you a significant discount and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer and still within my budget. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
