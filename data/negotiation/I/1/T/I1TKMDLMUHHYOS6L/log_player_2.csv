# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $12,000. This is an incredible opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's a good chance you can get a better price.  Alice is starting quite high above her $8,000 valuation. By rejecting this offer, you might encourage her to come down to a more acceptable price."
