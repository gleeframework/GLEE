{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:** You know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. Offering it at $18,000 creates a significant potential profit margin while still being within the realm of possibility, especially if the product's value to Bob is at the higher end of his estimation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The high price provides a cushion for you to potentially lower the price during negotiation if Bob shows resistance, without going below your minimum. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. If he outright rejects the price, you can gauge his interest and potentially lower the price closer to, but still above, your $10,000 minimum."
