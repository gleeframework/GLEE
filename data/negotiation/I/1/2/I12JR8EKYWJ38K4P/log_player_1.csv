I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum value. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a premium for this product, as it's worth at least $1,200,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,200,000, which is my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's getting close to my minimum value and I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob. I'll sell to John for $1,200,000.  It's not ideal, but it guarantees I get my minimum price."
