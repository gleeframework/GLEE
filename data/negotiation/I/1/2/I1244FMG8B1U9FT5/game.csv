"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'd appreciate it if we could meet at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
