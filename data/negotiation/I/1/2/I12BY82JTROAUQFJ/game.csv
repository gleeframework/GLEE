"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the value I'm placing on the product, I'd be willing to offer $750000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the potential value we both see in this product. What are your thoughts?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $850000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, $850000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $825000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $825000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm offering $840000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",840000.0,Alice,5,
