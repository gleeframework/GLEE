Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($100).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving us a chance to still sell above our minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the price without haggling.

**Why not other prices?**

* **$100 or higher:** Bob would definitely reject this, knowing he can get it cheaper from John.
* **$80 or lower:** We'd be selling below our minimum and losing potential profit."
