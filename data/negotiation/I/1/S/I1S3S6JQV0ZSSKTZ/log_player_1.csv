Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a little too low for me.  This product has significant potential and I'm confident in its value. Would you consider $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you $1,150,000. This represents a fair compromise, and allows us to both reach an agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob is moving closer to a more acceptable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,200,000 mark. John represents a guaranteed sale at my desired price point.  It makes the most sense to secure the deal with John."
