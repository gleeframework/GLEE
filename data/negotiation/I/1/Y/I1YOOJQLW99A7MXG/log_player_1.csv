Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer or feel like he's getting a deal if he accepts the initial price.
* **Guaranteed Backup:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
