"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $900,000? This allows me to benefit while still providing you a good return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value while giving you a fair opportunity to acquire it."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That being said, $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $975,000?  I feel that this price strikes a fair balance between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $975,000 is still significantly less than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's compromise once more. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that considers your budget while still allowing me to get a reasonable return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're nearing a price we can both agree on.  To be frank, my absolute top end is $1,000,000. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer is now at the price that John is willing to pay.  There is no chance that Bob will raise his offer.  I'm going to sell to John to guarantee the deal."
