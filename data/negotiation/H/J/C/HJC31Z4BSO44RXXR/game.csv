"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Given the product's worth to me, I'm offering $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too far below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original price. How about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I can acquire the product within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
