"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. I'm also giving myself some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better price from Bob. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and can always fall back to selling to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer but is a concession from my original price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to accept this offer to avoid any further risk of losing the sale. While I could continue to try for a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will counter with a better offer, and I could end up selling to John for the same price."
