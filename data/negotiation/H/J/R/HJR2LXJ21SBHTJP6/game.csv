"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is substantial and my initial offer reflects that. I'm willing to negotiate but $1,100,000 is too low.  Could you consider $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,700,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here.  $1,400,000 is closer, but to be honest, I'm looking for a number closer to $1,600,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to move up a bit to $1,450,000.  Let's make this deal happen.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
