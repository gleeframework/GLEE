"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,900. This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else. What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
