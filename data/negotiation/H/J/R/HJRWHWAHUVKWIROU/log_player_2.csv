"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 
This counter-offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for us to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our target price. Let's see if we can push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to a price we'd be happy with.  This offer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think $95 is a bit low. How about we meet at $105 again, like I suggested earlier? I'm willing to stick with this price if you are. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is holding firm at $105, but we can still try to negotiate a better price. We're getting close to the point where we might have to concede, but let's see if we can get her to budge one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm on a tight budget.  If you could do $98, I could close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 98
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Signals urgency:** By saying we could ""close the deal right now,"" we add a little pressure to accept. 
* **Presents a firm but fair price:**  $98 is a reasonable compromise, and by now Alice likely understands we're not going much higher.
* **Implies we have alternatives:**  Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Alice we're not stuck, even if John's offer isn't ideal.

This is a risky move, as it might lead Alice to walk away. But at this stage of negotiation, being a bit bolder can pay off."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $105. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so how about we meet at $102? It's a small step from your last offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has made a final compromise and is unlikely to go lower.  $102 is a decent price, and continuing to negotiate might make us lose the deal altogether."
