"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, I think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think $95 is a bit low. How about we meet at $105 again, like I suggested earlier? I'm willing to stick with this price if you are.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm on a tight budget.  If you could do $98, I could close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $105. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so how about we meet at $102? It's a small step from your last offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",102.0,Alice,7,
