Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,600,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start with a higher asking price.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps you understand how much Bob might value the product beyond the known $1,200,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high price leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially landing on a price higher than your minimum.
* **Scarcity Tactic:** Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency and competition. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or dislikes negotiation, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Information:** While you know Bob's minimum value, are there factors in the market that might make the product worth even more to him? 

This initial offer aims to maximize your profit while considering the information you have about Bob and your secured alternative buyer."
