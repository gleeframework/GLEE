"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $12,750? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. ",13000.0,Alice,5,
