"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $90 right now.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I think you'd be happy with the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $95. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $95, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",97.5,Alice,5,
