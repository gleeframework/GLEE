"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer in its field, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1400000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1600000, but I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm willing to offer $1500000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1600000. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, and I'd rather explore other options. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1550000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll be forced to consider other buyers.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
