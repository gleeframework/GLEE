"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Given the value you've indicated, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us, considering the potential of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is certainly a strong offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  I'm confident that at this price, you'll see a substantial return on your investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise and allows for a good return on investment for both of us. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
