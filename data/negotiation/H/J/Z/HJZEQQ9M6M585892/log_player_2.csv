{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal. You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above what the product is worth to Alice.  This leaves room for negotiation and shows you're serious about buying but also trying to get a good deal."
