Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth that can potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Remember,  I can always sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500.  This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than his offer."
