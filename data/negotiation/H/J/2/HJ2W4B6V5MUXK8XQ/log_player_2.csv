"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a great starting point, but I can likely get a better deal.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $550,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $550,000, which is a good price for me. It's still below my maximum budget of $800,000 and saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John.  I'll accept this offer and finalize the deal."
