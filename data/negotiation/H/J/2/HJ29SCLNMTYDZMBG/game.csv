,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $90?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $87.50? That's the best I can do.",87.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  $87.50 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $90 for the product. This is a great price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
