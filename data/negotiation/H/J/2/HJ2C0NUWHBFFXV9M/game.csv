,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $75?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $75, but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $80. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it right now.",80.0,Bob,4,
