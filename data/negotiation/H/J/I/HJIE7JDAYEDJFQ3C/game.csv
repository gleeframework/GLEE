"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $108. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's right in the middle of our current offers.",108.0,Bob,4,
