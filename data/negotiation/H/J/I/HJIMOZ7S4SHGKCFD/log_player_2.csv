"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1250000. This is a significant discount from its true value, which is $1500000 to me. I know this product is worth $1000000 to you, so this is a fantastic opportunity for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still higher than the price Bob can get from John. Therefore, it's better for Bob to reject Alice's offer and purchase the product from John for $1,000,000."
