"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,150,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message tries to create urgency, you have a better alternative. You know John will sell you the product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply buy from John and save $50,000."
