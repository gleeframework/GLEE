"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $13,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,500 is still too high for him, and he can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering the value it holds for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better price by counteroffering or buying from John.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice is also willing to negotiate, so there's potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your best offer, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,750.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Bob. Considering the situation, I am willing to lower my asking price to $12,850 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value and your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, he's still better off trying to get a lower price.  He has a few options:

* **Counteroffer:** He can try to negotiate a lower price, perhaps by offering $12,750 again or even a slightly lower amount.
* **Buy from John:** If he feels Alice is not going to budge further, he can always buy from John for $12,000, which is his maximum budget.

It's important for Bob to remember his goal: to save as much money as possible. While getting the product is important, he doesn't want to overpay for it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  I'm still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? This feels like a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
