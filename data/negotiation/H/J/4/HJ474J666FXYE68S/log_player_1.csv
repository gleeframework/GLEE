{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit lower than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is interested.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about we try $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $95. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer $95,  $92 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
