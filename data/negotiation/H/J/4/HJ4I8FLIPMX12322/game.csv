"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
