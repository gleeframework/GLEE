This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what Bob considers the product to be worth, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I still profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to earn. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've reviewed your latest offer and while I understand the value of your product, I am unable to agree to $1,075,000. I would like to propose $1,060,000 as a compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get him to move a little higher."

While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, we're still a bit far apart.  I'm not confident I can get him to go any higher, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely.  John is offering a much better price, so I'll take his offer and sell the product to him."
