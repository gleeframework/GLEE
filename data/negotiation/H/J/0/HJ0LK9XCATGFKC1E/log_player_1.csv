{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer allows me to gain a decent profit while still potentially leaving room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, offering $10,000 is a reasonable starting point.  I'm also leaving room to potentially negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,500 is still above my minimum threshold of $12,000.  It's also a reasonable compromise considering Bob's budget constraints and our previous negotiations. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale without risking losing a potential buyer altogether."
