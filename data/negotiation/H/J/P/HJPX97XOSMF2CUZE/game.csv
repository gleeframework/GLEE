"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  While $11000 is lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $13000 to accommodate your needs.  This is a significant reduction, but I'm confident the product's value will far exceed this price for you.  What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,3,,
