Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think it would be perfect for you, and this is a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 allows for some potential haggling if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120.

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, we increase the chance of making a profit from him while still having a safety net with John."
