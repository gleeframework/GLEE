{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, which might influence Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept and make a small profit, it's more strategic to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and leaves room for a potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This price still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's fair to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
