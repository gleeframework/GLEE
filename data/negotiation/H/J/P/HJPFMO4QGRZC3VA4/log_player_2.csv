"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, and Alice is asking for $18,000. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **Buying from John is an option.**  If the negotiation doesn't go well, you can always buy from John for $15,000, but it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $15,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,500?  This leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she's come down from $18,000, $16,500 is still above your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Rejecting keeps negotiation open.**  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating with Alice and try to get a price closer to your target.
* **John is still a backup.** You can always buy from John for $15,000 if the negotiations fail, so you can afford to be firm with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $16,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $16,000. This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
