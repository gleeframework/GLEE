Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique nature and your specific needs, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll reap."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 with John gives me a strong bargaining position. I'm not desperate to accept anything less than a great offer from Bob. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing the chances of a successful sale."
