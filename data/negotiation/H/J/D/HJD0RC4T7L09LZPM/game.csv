"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am hoping to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000? I believe this would still be a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while ensuring you get a great deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I understand your position, but I am aiming to keep my expenses within a specific limit. Could we possibly agree on $875,000? This would be a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests.",875000.0,Bob,4,
