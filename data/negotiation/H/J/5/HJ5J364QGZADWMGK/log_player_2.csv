"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's starting price is significantly above my limit. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but I know I can get it for $10,000 from John. I'll try one more counteroffer before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John at the guaranteed price."
