"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  I think this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a quick deal.  However, I'm not far from my minimum price point, leaving room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $135?  That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, and I believe there's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
