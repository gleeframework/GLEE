Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it allows for room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping this price will pique his interest and make him want to work with me to come to a mutually agreeable price.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is a good starting point.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $900,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer allows me to secure a deal quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a failed sale."
