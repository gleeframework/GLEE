"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000 to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, while also reflecting the inherent worth of what I'm offering.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,212,500? I believe that is a fair reflection of the product's value.",1212500.0,Bob,4,
