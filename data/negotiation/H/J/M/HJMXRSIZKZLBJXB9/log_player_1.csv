Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept. Here's why:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $8,000 minimum, increasing your potential profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** At $9,500, Bob still gets a $500 value out of the deal, making it attractive for him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have some wiggle room to negotiate without dropping below your minimum."
