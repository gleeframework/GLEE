"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of our budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer since it's higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to sell for.  I'm confident I can push for a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,050,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know if this price is acceptable."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  This offer is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's price while still ensuring I earn significantly more than his initial offer. 
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes mutual benefit, aiming to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  The counteroffer is still higher than Bob's previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also my value for the product.
* **Show flexibility:**  The offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Keep the negotiation active:**  The message encourages Bob to respond, keeping the dialogue open and potentially leading to a faster resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,020,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise my bottom line.  John is offering a price that meets my requirements, and it's better to secure the deal with him than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk losing both deals."
