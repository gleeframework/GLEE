"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a decent markup from my minimum value of $150.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that just yet. I'll counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it still gives me a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing him entirely."
