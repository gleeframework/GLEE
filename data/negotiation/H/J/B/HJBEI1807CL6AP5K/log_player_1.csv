Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,500. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While this is a firm offer, the slightly lower price than his perceived value might make it more appealing.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a strong offer can set the tone for the negotiation, even though there isn't much room for back and forth in this scenario.
* **Backup Plan:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net, ensuring you won't go below your minimum."
