Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done my research and I believe that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product goes beyond $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle for $1,600,000?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. How about we try $1,400,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's anchored at his valuation of $1,200,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap sufficiently to warrant continuing the conversation when I have a guaranteed offer for $1,500,000 from John."
