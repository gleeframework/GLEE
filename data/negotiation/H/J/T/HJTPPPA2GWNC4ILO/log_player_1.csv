"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a great deal to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start the conversation at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $600,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can do better, even if it means a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would still give you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be.  I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better deal. I'm still keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $850,000?  This is a fair compromise, considering your budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's try to reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 825000}
