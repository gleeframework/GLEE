"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a little extra for the product, but I'm also aware that John is a solid backup option if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have a guaranteed $120 from John. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm still trying to maximize my profit, but I'm also being flexible with Bob.  $100 is a reasonable compromise, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  John is my safety net, and I can always sell to him if I need to. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob to meet my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $95 is still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $97.50 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the sale now."", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```

I'm offering a compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to close the deal, as it's a good price for both of us.  If he still rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum of $120.  I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $120."
