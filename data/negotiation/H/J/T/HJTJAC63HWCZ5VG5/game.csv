"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's the best I can do.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $95 is still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $97.50 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the sale now.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",92.0,Bob,6,
