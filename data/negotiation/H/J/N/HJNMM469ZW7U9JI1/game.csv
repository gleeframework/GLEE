"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $8,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to go above $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. To be completely transparent, I'm considering another offer for $12,000.  If you're truly serious about purchasing, I'm willing to go down to $9,500.  This is a final offer, and it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know your decision.",9500.0,Alice,5,
