This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer."

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."
