# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1050000. It's a valuable piece and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Consider it an investment in your future success.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option to achieve Bob's goal."
