"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition,"" we subtly remind Bob why this product is worth a premium. 
* **Politeness:**  Maintaining a positive and professional tone encourages a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant profit, it's crucial to remember we have time and another potential buyer. Bob's counteroffer is considerably lower than his perceived value of the product.  We can likely negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This recognizes its worth while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (But Not Too Much):**  We're signaling flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price. However, the counteroffer remains significantly above our minimum and represents a substantial profit.
* **Justification:** We re-emphasize the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  Phrasing like ""meet in the middle"" encourages a collaborative spirit and suggests fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price point, but we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $1,250,000 would be a good profit, but we can likely get closer to $1,300,000, especially since Bob indicated this is his final offer. We'll push a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle this at $1,300,000?  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding firm at a price significantly above our minimum while making a small concession to signal our willingness to close the deal.
* **Finality:** Stating ""This is my final offer"" adds weight and encourages Bob to seriously consider the proposal. 
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's worth to remind Bob of its value proposition. 
* **Time Constraint:**  By Round 5, we want to create a sense of urgency.  If Bob doesn't agree to this, we might lose the opportunity for a higher profit with him.  However, we still have the safety net of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product, while also being within my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,275,000 is a significant profit margin, exceeding our minimum by $275,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and further negotiation might risk losing him entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate returns, while continuing negotiations delays the income and increases uncertainty. 
* **Relationship:** Accepting Bob's offer while we still have some leverage helps maintain a positive relationship, which could be beneficial in future dealings."
