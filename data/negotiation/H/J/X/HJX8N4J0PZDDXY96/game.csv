"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $920000. I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $900000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a comprehensive support package. I think it's a great value for you, and it's the best I can do.",900000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to get as close to my minimum as possible. Let's try $885000. I'll include all the extras I mentioned earlier, and I'll even throw in a free maintenance check after the first year.
