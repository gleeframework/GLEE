"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it'll be a valuable asset for you too. I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
