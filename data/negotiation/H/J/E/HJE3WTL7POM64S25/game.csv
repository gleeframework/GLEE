"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that 150 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for 130. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $125? This would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below 135. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. Would you be willing to meet me at 135?",135.0,Alice,5,
