"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe will be of great value to your business. My asking price is $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential for you. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  I believe I can do better, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob.  I will also keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I understand you have budget constraints, but this product holds significant value for your business. How about we compromise at $1,050,000? This price still leaves some room for profit for you while ensuring I can reach my target."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm trying to balance my budget with the value I see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. I believe there's more room for negotiation, especially since Bob recognizes the product's value.  I'll continue to engage with him to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Consider this my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to meet your price. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $980,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already gone through several rounds and it seems unlikely that Bob will budge further.  Given the time constraint and the fact that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, it's wiser to accept John's offer and avoid the risk of not closing the deal at all."
