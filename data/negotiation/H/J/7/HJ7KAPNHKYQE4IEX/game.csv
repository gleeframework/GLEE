"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I understand you have budget constraints, but this product holds significant value for your business. How about we compromise at $1,050,000? This price still leaves some room for profit for you while ensuring I can reach my target.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm trying to balance my budget with the value I see in this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Consider this my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to meet your price. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
