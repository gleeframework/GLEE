Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product is valuable, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still only able to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly reach an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is insistent on $8,000. I've already offered to lower my price and it seems like further negotiation won't lead to a higher price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
