You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her asking price, it's still above your maximum price of $120. You can try to negotiate a better price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $125 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $130.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

While $130 is closer to your limit, it's still above your maximum budget.  You're better off buying from John for $120 and saving the extra $10."
