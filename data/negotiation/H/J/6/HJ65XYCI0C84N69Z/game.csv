"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000. Can you consider this revised price?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,125,000 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to go a little lower to $1,140,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it ensures we both get a fair deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1140000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but $1,140,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,130,000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with. Can you meet me at this price?",1130000.0,Bob,6,
