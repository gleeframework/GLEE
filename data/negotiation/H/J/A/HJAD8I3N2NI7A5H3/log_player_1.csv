Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA, as John is willing to pay your full asking price of $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Perspective:**  The product is worth less to Bob ($1,200,000) than it is to you.  
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 represents a potential deal where both you and Bob would benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that is as close to $1,500,000 as possible without alienating Bob completely.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:**  Begin with an offer slightly below your BATNA to leave room for negotiation but signal the product's value.
2. **Highlight Value:**  Frame your offer in terms of the value it brings to Bob, not just the price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its unique capabilities and the potential it has to benefit your business, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a price that reflects the significant value it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* This offer starts high but within a reasonable range. 
* The message emphasizes value rather than just focusing on the price.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response and willingness to counter-offer."
