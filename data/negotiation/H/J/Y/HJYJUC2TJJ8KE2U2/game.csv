"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12200.0,Bob,4,
