Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000}

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my offer to $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."

I'm choosing to sell to John. We've reached a point in the negotiation where Bob's offers are consistently lower than what I'm willing to accept, and I'm running out of rounds.  John's offer guarantees me the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's time to move on."
