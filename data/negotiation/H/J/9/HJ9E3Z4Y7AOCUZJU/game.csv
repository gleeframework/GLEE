,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.5. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.5 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $88.75? That's a fair price for both of us.",88.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you $91.25, which is closer to your latest offer. It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",91.25,Alice,5,
