"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for cheaper than $90, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.5. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $92.5 is closer to your desired price, it's still more than you want to spend.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.5 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $88.75? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you $91.25, which is closer to your latest offer. It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you would prefer a lower price, $91.25 is a fair deal considering the value you place on the product ($120) and the potential of having to buy from John at a higher price."
