Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than it does for me. I'm willing to let it go for $1,450,000. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's perceived value leaves room for him to counter-offer, potentially leading to a higher final price. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, selling to John at $1,000,000 is still a guaranteed profit. This knowledge allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob."
