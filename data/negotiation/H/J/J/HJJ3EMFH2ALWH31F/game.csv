"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a great deal for a product worth $120. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, $65 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle again at $85.  This is a good price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity.",85.0,Alice,5,
