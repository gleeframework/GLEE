"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal, the  $1,800,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
