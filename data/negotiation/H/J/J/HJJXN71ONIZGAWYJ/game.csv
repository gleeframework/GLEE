"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $50. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $70. I'm willing to compromise at $85. It's a good price for a unique product like this, and I think it's worth it. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you do $75?",75.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $82. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $85. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $82 again, but I'm not going any lower. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,9,
