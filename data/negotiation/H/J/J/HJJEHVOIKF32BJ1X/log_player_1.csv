Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. It's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but not so high as to scare Bob off immediately. I want to see if he's seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
``` 

I'm offering $9,750. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not sure if he'll budge much more.  It's getting too risky to keep negotiating.  I'm guaranteed $8,000 from John, and I don't want to risk ending up with less after more rounds of back and forth."
