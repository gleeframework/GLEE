"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $140. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 feels a bit high for me. Could you do it for $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($110), we aim to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a great deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  We've left space between our offer and our maximum budget ($150), allowing for some back-and-forth with Alice.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation tone while clearly stating our desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. We're aiming for the best possible price, and settling at $130 might leave some potential savings on the table. Let's try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By offering $120, we're suggesting a compromise that splits the difference between her current offer ($130) and our previous counteroffer ($110). This shows flexibility while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Direct and Justified:** We clearly state our desired price and provide a simple justification (""fair price"") without being overly aggressive in the negotiation. 
* **Approaching the Limit:** We're getting closer to our maximum budget of $150.  If Alice rejects this offer, we'll need to carefully consider if further negotiation is worth the potential savings compared to buying from John."
