"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $14000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $12500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and $13500, which would be $13000. Would you be willing to meet me at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
