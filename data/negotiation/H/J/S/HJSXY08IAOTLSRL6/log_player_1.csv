Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet halfway!"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us and lets us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$12,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not happy with it. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $14,000, which is a fair compromise and still within my acceptable range.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. How about $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my budget.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to try to push for a bit more. I have a few rounds left and am confident I can secure a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
