"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way too high, and he has a better option with John.  There's no need to accept such a high price when he can get it for significantly less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet halfway! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his budget. It's still worth seeing if he can negotiate further. He can always choose to buy from John if he can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us and lets us reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $14,000, which is a fair compromise and still within my acceptable range.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for compromise, and he should see if he can get it down to $12,000 or even lower. If not, he can always choose to buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. How about $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my budget.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's a good compromise at $13,500. It's higher than his ideal price but still a significant savings compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice could reject his counteroffer, leaving him with only the option of buying from John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product at a reasonable price."
