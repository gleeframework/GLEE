Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  This would be a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go down to $100.  You've reached your maximum price, and it's better to secure the product from John at your target price rather than risk the negotiations failing."
