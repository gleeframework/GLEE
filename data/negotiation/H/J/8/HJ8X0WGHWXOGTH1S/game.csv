"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $80 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that $80 is a significant drop, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we possibly settle on $95? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $100, which is my absolute limit. This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  This would be a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen!",105.0,Alice,7,
