```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a comfortable margin. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential to Bob, aiming to pique his interest. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a potential buyer gives me a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't go well."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired target.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** I believe there's room for negotiation, as Bob is clearly interested in the product.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm decreasing my price from the initial offer but still leaving room for a potential compromise. This shows flexibility while maintaining a high value.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and the potential benefit it holds for his business.
* **Negotiation Tone:** My message aims for a cooperative tone, encouraging Bob to see the value in reaching an agreement."

* **Negotiation Opportunity:** With several rounds left, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a middle ground, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.

```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still just a little below my desired target. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** We've only had 6 rounds, and I believe there is still room to negotiate further and reach a more favorable price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I want to maximize my profit. There's a chance I can get a higher price with Bob, and it's still too early to settle for John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I appreciate that.  However, $975,000 is still just a bit short of where I need to be. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the significant value this product offers, and it's a fair compromise. I believe this is a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price, and we're running out of rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob won't budge further, and I'll end up with a price lower than John's offer.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a good profit. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only two rounds remaining, there's not enough time to potentially get a better price from Bob. It's more prudent to accept the guaranteed offer from John."
