"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your ideal price and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to get the product as close to John's price ($80) as possible, so starting at $65 gives me a good buffer.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is polite but clearly communicates that the initial offer is too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice's counteroffer of $82.50 is just slightly above John's price of $80. 
* **Not Worth the Risk:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice would go lower. It's possible she'd reject further offers and I'd end up having to buy from John anyway.
* **Saving Time and Effort:** Accepting now secures the product and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
