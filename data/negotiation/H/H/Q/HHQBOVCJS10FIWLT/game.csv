"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $975,000. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still not a workable price for me.  Let's try $1,025,000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $990,000 still falls short of my desired price. I'm prepared to meet you halfway once again. How about we settle on $1,005,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1005000.0,Alice,7,
