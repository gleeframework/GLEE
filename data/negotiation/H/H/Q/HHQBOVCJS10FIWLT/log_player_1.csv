"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate, but it also keeps the deal within your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to take the quick deal,  I need to hold out for a better price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $975,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I need to see if we can bridge the gap further before I consider selling to him.  I'm not willing to compromise on my bottom line, so I will counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still not a workable price for me.  Let's try $1,025,000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I still think $990,000 is a fair price. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable accepting his offer. There are still rounds left, and I'm determined to get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to reach a deal that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $990,000 still falls short of my desired price. I'm prepared to meet you halfway once again. How about we settle on $1,005,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1005000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm offering $995,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, we're running out of rounds. I'm not confident I can reach my target price in the remaining time.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
