"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you consider $80? ",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $90 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  I'm really hoping to close this deal today.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $85 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about we settle on $88?  I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us.",88.0,Alice,5,
