Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still ensuring a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at $150.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having a safety net in John's offer."
