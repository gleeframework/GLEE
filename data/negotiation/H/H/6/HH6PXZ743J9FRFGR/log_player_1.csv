Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. Could we meet somewhere in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your prompt response, Alice. I'm still looking for a price that works within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,000. Would you consider meeting me halfway?

While I could push for more, Bob seems firm at $15,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
