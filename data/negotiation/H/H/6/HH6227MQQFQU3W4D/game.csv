"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $70. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $90? That's a $10 discount from my original offer and a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $90, which would be $80. Would you be willing to accept that price?",80.0,Bob,4,
