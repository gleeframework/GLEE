"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters. It's also higher than my minimum value of $80, so I'm still making a profit even if he accepts immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95. While it's closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm countering with $98. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to buy, but I'm also leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $92. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 96}
```

I'm countering with $96. This is a further compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our last offers. I'm hoping this will be enough to get a deal done, as we're getting close to my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'd like to get.  With only four rounds left, I'm concerned I won't be able to get a higher price. To secure a sale and avoid losing out completely, I'm choosing to sell to John for $80."
