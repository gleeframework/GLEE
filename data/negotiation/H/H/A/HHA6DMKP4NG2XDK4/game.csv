"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product.  However,  $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $750000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's unique value.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $825000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000,  which is a fair compromise considering my initial offer and your latest offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815000. I believe this is the best price we can reach considering the product's value and rarity.",815000.0,Alice,5,
