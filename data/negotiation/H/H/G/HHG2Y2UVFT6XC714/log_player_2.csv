"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I believe it has great value and would like to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still above your ideal price. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially secure a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer significantly reduces the price, but it's still within a reasonable range, leaving room for further negotiation. This aggressive move shows your intent to purchase but also emphasizes the price difference. It should spark further negotiation and reveal Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but her offer is still above what you're comfortable with.  You have several rounds left, and you can likely secure a better price by continuing to negotiate. While buying from John is a safe option, it's not the most financially advantageous one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, showing you're serious about buying the product but still want a good price. It also provides a clear middle ground for Alice to consider, potentially leading to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to you and the market demand. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a strong commitment to a price close to her minimum.  While you'd like to go lower, the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John is too high at this point.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's still significantly lower than what John is offering, and you can't be sure you'll get a better deal if you continue negotiating."
