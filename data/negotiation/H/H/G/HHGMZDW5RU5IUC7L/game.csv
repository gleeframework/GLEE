"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've done some research and found that similar products in the market are selling for significantly higher prices. Considering the value this product can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000? It's a good middle ground, and I'm ready to move forward if you're open to it.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $925,000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering it to you for $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $920,000.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we've discussed.  It's a strong price that allows me to move forward with the purchase. Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm now offering it to you for $915,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,
