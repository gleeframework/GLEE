Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can bring the price down further."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still above my ideal price.  I'm going to counteroffer again to try and get closer to my target of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference again.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1,275,000 is a more reasonable price. It's a small increase, but it's still a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down to a price that is very close to my target of $1,200,000. It's likely that further negotiation will be incremental, and I don't want to risk going back and forth for a few more rounds only to end up with a price closer to $1,300,000.  I'm going to accept her offer and secure the product."
