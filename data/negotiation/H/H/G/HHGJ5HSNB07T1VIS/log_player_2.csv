"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair and competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $650,000 is still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $675,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000

This is a good deal for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will go up instead of down.  $675,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer."
