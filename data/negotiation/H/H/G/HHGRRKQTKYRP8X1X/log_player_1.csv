""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept $1,000,000 (from John) if Bob refuses.
* **Negotiating Room:** There's a potential profit of $500,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,000,000).

**The Offer:**

By offering the product at $1,350,000, you're:

* **Leaving Money on the Table for Bob:** This price gives Bob a $150,000 incentive to buy from you instead of missing out. 
* **Maximizing Your Profit:** You're securing a $350,000 profit above your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims for a win-win situation where both you and Bob benefit from the deal."
