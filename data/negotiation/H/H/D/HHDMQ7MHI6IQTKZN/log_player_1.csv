"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10,000. It's a steal for what it can do! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down while still making a profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to sell the product to Bob for $8,000, it's still early in the negotiation and I believe there's room for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $8,000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about $9,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it still allows me to make a profit.  Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can agree on that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it's reasonable considering the negotiations so far.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and move on."
