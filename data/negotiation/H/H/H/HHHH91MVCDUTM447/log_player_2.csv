"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product which I believe would be of immense value to you. Given its high quality and unique features, it's worth $12,000 to us. However, I understand the importance of negotiation in transactions like these. To make this deal attractive for both parties, I am offering the product to you for $10,800. This is a special offer tailored specifically for you, considering your needs and the benefits our product can bring to your business or personal use. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details about the product. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

Alice's offer of $10,800 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
