Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'd still be getting a good deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This price is fair for both of us and allows for a successful transaction.  Let me know what you think.
