{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy! I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by mentioning Bob's potential enjoyment of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can potentially get a better price.  I will counteroffer to see if there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $105. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product!  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
