"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  He should counteroffer Alice to try and get a better price, but keep in mind that he has a backup option with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9,000 is your budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, it's still above his budget. He should counteroffer again, trying to get closer to his desired price of $8,000. He has John as a backup option, but it's worth trying to see if he can get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  He's already countered Alice multiple times, and her latest offer is still above his budget. While he could continue to counteroffer, it's unlikely that Alice will go down to his desired price.  It's best to secure the product from John at a price he's comfortable with."
