"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  We want to save as much money as possible and aim for a price closer to Alice's minimum value of $1,000,000. We'll start negotiating by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my desired range. I'm going to continue to negotiate and try to get closer to my target price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering your desired outcome and the value I see in this product. Let's try to reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise, and it's close to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  It's better to secure this deal and save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
