Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $200,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. It also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but it's still above my budget. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to $1,500,000 with another counteroffer. I'm not ready to buy from John just yet."
