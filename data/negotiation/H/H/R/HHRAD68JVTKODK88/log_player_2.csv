Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,800. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, you still have room to negotiate further.  You've already shown a willingness to go lower than $9,500, and Alice has indicated a willingness to compromise. There's still potential for a deal closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. If you're serious about making a deal, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,400. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. While it's still above your target price of $8,000, it's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000, and Alice has indicated that this is her final offer.  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate further and get a lower price, so it's best to secure the product at a reasonable price."
