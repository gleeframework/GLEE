Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to give room for negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** The offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed purchase price, ensuring Alice a profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing might encourage Bob to act quickly."
