"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is still fair, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your efforts. However, $1,175,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,212,500. This price reflects the value I place on the product while still acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. Let's close this deal!",1212500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  To show I'm serious, I can go up to $1,190,000. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal soon.",1190000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,190,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 as a final concession. This is a fair price that reflects both our positions.  Let's settle this now and move forward.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
