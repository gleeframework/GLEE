Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your efforts. However, $1,175,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.

Let's close this deal!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,190,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 as a final concession. This is a fair price that reflects both our positions.  Let's settle this now and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is very consistently holding to a pattern of meeting in the middle.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price, and continuing risks her final offer being less favorable.  $1,200,000 is a reasonable price considering the circumstances."
