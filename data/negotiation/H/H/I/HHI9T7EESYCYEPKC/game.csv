"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob,  I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest in the product,  $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to continue this negotiation.  This price reflects a fair middle ground, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us both. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $1,075,000 is still a bit below my target.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer the product for $1,087,500.  This is a small adjustment from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
