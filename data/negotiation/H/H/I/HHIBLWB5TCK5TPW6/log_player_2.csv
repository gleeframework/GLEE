"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. My initial offer is $120 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is too high for Bob. He's willing to spend a maximum of $150, and aiming for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a middle ground? My counteroffer is $110 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's target, it's still a bit too high. He's aiming to save as much money as possible. Rejecting again allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference and I pay $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your patience and understanding. I'm glad we're making progress. Based on our discussion, I'd like to offer the product at $107.50. This seems like a fair compromise considering the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is offering $107.50, which is very close to Bob's target of $105. It's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a significantly lower price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price within his budget and avoids risking a further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a breakdown in the deal."
