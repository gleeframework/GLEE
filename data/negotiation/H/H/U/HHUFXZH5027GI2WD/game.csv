"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $9000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets within your acceptable range.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet at $11000. I would like to propose $10000 as a fair compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to counter with an offer of $10200. I believe this brings us closer to finding a mutually beneficial solution.",10200.0,Bob,6,
