"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,155.0
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss $155? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",155.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120. This is my final offer.",120.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,140.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $120, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $140? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,,
