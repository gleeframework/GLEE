Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $8,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,000. I think that's a fair price for the product's value to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $12,000. I think that's a fair price for the product's value to me.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently sticking to a price point far below the product's value to me. While he's showing some willingness to negotiate, his counteroffers are incrementally small.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price point close enough to $15,000 within the remaining rounds to make continuing negotiations worthwhile. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best outcome for me at this point."
