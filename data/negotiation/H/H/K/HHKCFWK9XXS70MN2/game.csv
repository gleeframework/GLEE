"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $80 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, $140 is still a bit too steep for me.  I could potentially go up to $90, but that's about as high as I can go. Do you think that would work?",90.0,Bob,4,
