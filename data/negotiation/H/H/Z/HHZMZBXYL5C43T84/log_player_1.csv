"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving a good profit margin for me. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to me, hoping to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still within the first few rounds and can potentially get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $9,750, hoping to meet in the middle. I'm also emphasizing my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider $9,600 as a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,600 is getting close to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a bit more. I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to John. There's still a chance Bob might come up to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable. How about we split the difference and go with $9,650? I'm confident you'll be happy with this price, and I'll be able to get a good deal, too."", ""product_price"": 9650}
```

I'm offering a price that's only $50 higher than Bob's latest offer, making it clear that I'm willing to compromise and that this could be the final price. I'm also emphasizing the win-win aspect of this price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose $9,600 as a final counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, the negotiations have gone on for a while and I'm not sure if I can push him higher. Plus, $9,600 is a good price, and selling to John would net me $12,000, but I might be able to close the deal faster with Bob."
