"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $150, so I'm offering the product to you for $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $125? I'm confident that this price is fair and allows you to make a profit as well.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $128. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm close to your price, but $128 is still slightly more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $126? It's a small difference, but it would be a good deal for both of us.",126.0,Bob,6,

"I can see that you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more small concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $127. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",127.0,Alice,7,
