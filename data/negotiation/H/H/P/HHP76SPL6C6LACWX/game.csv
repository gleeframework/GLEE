"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in the negotiation.  While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $2,050,000? This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",2050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $2,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I need to be honest, I'm getting close to considering buying from John. Can you meet me at $1,900,000 or lower?",1900000.0,Bob,6,
