"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is $950,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can likely get a better deal than $950,000.
*  Even if the negotiation fails, you have the option of buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $950,000, and you want to pay as little as possible. 
* Offering $850,000 is a significant reduction, but it's still above Alice's minimum selling price of $800,000.
* This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying the product but are also trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer is $975,000, which is still higher than your initial counteroffer of $850,000. 
*  While it's closer to your maximum price, you can still potentially negotiate a lower price.
* You have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's last offer was $975,000, and you want to pay as little as possible.
* Offering $900,000 is a compromise that's closer to her previous offer but still significantly lower than her original asking price.
* This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet her halfway but still trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $987,500, which is getting very close to your maximum price of $1,000,000.
* While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will continue to raise her price, potentially forcing you to pay more than $1,000,000.
* Given the risk of escalating price and your backup option with John, it's more prudent to buy from John for $1,000,000. This ensures you get the product while staying within your budget and avoiding potential risks."
