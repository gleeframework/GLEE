"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still represents a good deal for both of us.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1550000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and is a good deal considering the limited time we have left in the negotiation.  I'll accept his offer."
