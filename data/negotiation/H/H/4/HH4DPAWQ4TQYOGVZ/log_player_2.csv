"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. This is a fair price given its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the initial offer allows for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1400000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which still represents a good deal for both of us.  This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,600,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred maximum of $1,500,000. There are still rounds left to negotiate, and you could potentially get closer to your target price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
