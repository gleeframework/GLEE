{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your $10,000 minimum.
* **Below Bob's maximum:**  It's a good price for Bob, giving him some wiggle room. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers and a more engaging negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to save a bit more 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and your desired price. You should reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,750? That's the best I can do 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is closer to your desired price than your minimum of $10,000. It's a good compromise and likely the best you'll get from Bob.  While you could try for a higher price, there's a risk that he'll walk away, leaving you with the lower offer from John."
