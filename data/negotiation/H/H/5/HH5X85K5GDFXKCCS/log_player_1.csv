Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

While Bob is getting closer, $920,000 is still not high enough to meet my minimum goal. I'll counter with a price that's still within a reasonable range for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to come down to $935,000.

Round 7

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.  While $910,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum goal, and we're nearing the end of our rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000."
