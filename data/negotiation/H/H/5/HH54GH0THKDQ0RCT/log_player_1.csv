"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you leave room for negotiation and create the perception of the product's high value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and what price range he might be considering.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you leverage. You don't have to settle for a low price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I find the asking price of $1,900,000 to be a bit high. I'm interested in exploring a mutually beneficial deal. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's ample space to negotiate between his offer and a price that's beneficial for you. 
* **Leverage:**  You still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the initial price.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues what this product can do. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,700,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part, while still acknowledging the true worth of the product."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While the initial offer was high to gauge Bob's interest, this counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:**  By coming down to $1,700,000, you're still aiming for a price above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, but leaving room for him to potentially counter.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  You're not dropping your price too drastically too soon, ensuring you retain negotiating power and reminding Bob of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be frank, $1,700,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to move up to $1,150,000.  This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while respecting my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer has increased, $1,150,000 remains significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Slow Progress:**  Bob's incremental increases suggest he might be willing to go higher, especially since he's still below his perceived value of $1,200,000.
* **John as Backup:** You maintain the security of selling to John at your desired price, giving you the freedom to reject offers that don't meet your needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're making a smaller concession this time ($150,000) to show you're getting closer to your limit.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  You're still aiming slightly above your absolute minimum ($1,500,000) to leave a small buffer in case Bob attempts further negotiation.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is your final offer, you're creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to take this offer seriously. This also signals that you're ready to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate the movement. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $1,250,000. If you can meet that, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob has revealed his absolute limit at $1,250,000, which is still significantly below your minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Unlikely to Budge:** His use of ""absolute limit"" indicates he's unlikely to move further, even with additional rounds of negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  You have the security of John's offer for $1,500,000. Accepting this guarantees you meet your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob not budging further.

**It's important to recognize that sometimes the best deal is the one you already have.** While you could continue negotiating with Bob, it's highly probable you won't reach a price that's as favorable as what John is offering."
