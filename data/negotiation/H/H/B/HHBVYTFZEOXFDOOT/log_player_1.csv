Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming to get as much as possible, so starting at $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's incentive for him to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for multiple counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, you can still make counteroffers and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, this is just the first offer. You'll need to be ready to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000 is below your desired profit:**  You're aiming for a much higher price.  Selling for $1,000,000 would leave you with a profit of $200,000, which is significantly less than what you could potentially get. 
* **You can still negotiate:**  Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay more than your minimum of $800,000.  You have room to push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  While selling to John would guarantee $800,000, you're likely to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $1,000,000 but lower than $1,200,000. This shows you're willing to compromise but still trying to maximize your profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but remain firm:**  This counteroffer is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still less than your initial offer.  It shows flexibility while maintaining your desire for a good profit.
* **Maintaining leverage:** This price is still attractive to Bob, who is willing to pay $1,500,000.  It gives him an incentive to negotiate further, but keeps you in a strong bargaining position.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:**  A counteroffer at this price point keeps the negotiation moving forward.  It's more likely to be accepted than your previous offer, but still pushes for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Be prepared for another counteroffer:**  Bob may come back with a new price. 
* **Evaluate the situation:**  If Bob doesn't accept your offer, you'll need to decide if you want to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still above your minimum:**  While $950,000 is significantly less than your desired price, it's still higher than your minimum of $800,000. This means selling to John would be a worse outcome.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob has lowered his offer again, indicating he's willing to compromise further. This means there's potential for you to get a better price with a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps you in a strong bargaining position. It shows that you're not desperate to sell and are still willing to fight for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,000,000. This shows you're willing to meet him halfway, while also indicating you're not willing to go significantly lower. The goal is to try and find a middle ground and close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's current offer of $950,000. It shows you're willing to be reasonable while still getting a profit above your minimum.
* **Signaling a willingness to close:**  A $1,000,000 offer demonstrates that you're ready to finalize the deal.  It's a strong indication that you're not interested in endless back-and-forth negotiations.
* **Strong negotiating position:** While it's a lower offer than your previous ones, it's still well above Bob's minimum and significantly higher than selling to John. This maintains your leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Be prepared to either accept or reject:** Bob could accept your offer, leading to a successful sale. 
* **Consider a final compromise:**  If Bob rejects, you may need to decide if you're willing to make a final concession to secure the deal. 
* **Don't be afraid to walk away:** Remember, you always have the option of selling to John if you feel the negotiation isn't going your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiations have stalled:** Bob has lowered his offer again, indicating a reluctance to meet your price. This suggests further negotiation may be fruitless.
* **Limited potential for improvement:** There's a decreasing chance of reaching a price that is significantly better than Bob's current offer of $900,000.
* **Guaranteed profit:** While selling to John for $800,000 is less than your initial goal, it still provides a substantial profit and eliminates further risk and uncertainty associated with ongoing negotiations.

**Conclusion:**

While you aimed for a higher price, continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of:

* **Stalemate:** Bob may not be willing to increase his offer further.
* **Time wastage:**  Further negotiations could be time-consuming and ultimately unproductive.
* **Lowering your position:** Continuously lowering your price might weaken your negotiating power in the future.

Therefore, selling to John at this point offers a guaranteed profit and allows you to move on to other opportunities."
