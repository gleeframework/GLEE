Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the ""incredible value"" and ""unique opportunity"" to justify the high price.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to get more than $1,000,000.

**It's important to note:** This strategy is based on maximizing profit. A more risk-averse approach would be to offer a price closer to $1,000,000 to ensure a sale."
