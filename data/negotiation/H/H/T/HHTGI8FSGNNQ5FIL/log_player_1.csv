{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so this price gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum of $12,000, so you're not losing money.
* **It's a reasonable opening price:** This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation, making him more likely to counter-offer. 

By offering this price, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a final price that is closer to my desired value. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, allowing me to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original price, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is better than his initial offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Bob is showing interest and willing to negotiate.  I can likely reach a more favorable price by counter-offering. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $12,000.

I'll counter-offer Bob to keep the negotiation going, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $8,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a good compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **This offer is closer to Bob's offer:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,500, which shows Bob I'm serious about selling to him.
* **It's still above my minimum:** This price is still higher than my minimum of $12,000, so I'm not losing money even if Bob accepts.
* **This encourages further negotiation:** This counteroffer is a fair compromise and keeps the negotiation going. 

I'm confident that this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation, as I am showing a willingness to compromise while still protecting my financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9,250. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While closer to my desired price, $9,250 is still below my minimum of $12,000.
* **There is still room for negotiation:** Bob is showing continued interest and willingness to compromise, which suggests the possibility of reaching a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer is a secure backup:** I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

I will counter-offer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  However, I will be more cautious in this counteroffer, as I am approaching the point where John's offer becomes more attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to compromise. However, $9,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I can't go any lower than $9,750. This is truly my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're able to accept it."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While still a bit below my ideal, $9,750 is much closer to my minimum of $12,000, and it's a decent compromise considering Bob's budget.
* **A clear signal:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, which might prompt Bob to accept to avoid losing the deal.
* **Preparing for a potential walk-away:** If Bob rejects this final offer, I'm prepared to accept John's offer and walk away from the negotiation.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to secure a sale with Bob, but I'm also ready to move on if necessary."
