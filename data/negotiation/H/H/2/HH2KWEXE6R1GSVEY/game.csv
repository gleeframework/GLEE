"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It seems we both recognize the significant value of this product.  While $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to move down to $1,200,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair deal given the potential returns you stand to gain.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to go up to $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000, so I'm thinking of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
