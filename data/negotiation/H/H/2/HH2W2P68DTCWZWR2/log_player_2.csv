"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. We can aim for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** We know Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,000,000.  
* **Aggressive but Fair:**  Offering $1,050,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It shows a strong desire to buy, but also demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. If she accepts, it's a great deal. If she rejects, we'll have a clearer picture of her bottom line and can adjust accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** Alice's counteroffer is higher than our initial counteroffer but still lower than her first offer. This indicates she's willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  Rejecting again shows we're serious about getting a better price and aren't willing to settle yet. 
* **Next Steps:**  In the next round, we can make a counteroffer closer to her $1,375,000, but with a slight decrease to show progress and test her limits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer ($1,050,000) and Alice's last offer ($1,375,000). It demonstrates our willingness to compromise while still leaving room for a little more negotiation.
* **Show Progress:**  It shows Alice that we're not simply throwing out random numbers, but genuinely trying to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Testing the Limits:** This will gauge how close Alice is to accepting a deal. If she rejects, we'll know she's holding out for a higher price and can adjust our strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Increasing Offers:**  Alice's offers have been steadily increasing. While her current offer is still lower than John's price, it's getting closer to the point where buying from John might be the better option. 
* **Holding Out for a Better Deal:**  We need to stay firm in our goal of securing a lower price. We can afford to reject a few more offers, hoping Alice will come down further.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  In the next round, we'll counter with a slightly higher offer than our previous one, but still well below Alice's current offer. This will show we're willing to compromise, but also demonstrate that we're not willing to settle for a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing the Scales:** We're moving closer to Alice's last offer but still staying below her current offer. It shows that we're serious about getting a deal but won't overpay.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, we need to start seriously considering the risk of running out of time and having to buy from John.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will reveal whether Alice is willing to meet us halfway or if she's determined to stick to a price that's too high for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Equal Prices:** Alice's offer is now the same as John's price. There is no advantage to continuing negotiations with Alice.
* **Time Constraint:** We have only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will lower her price further.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Buying from John guarantees the deal, avoiding the risk of Alice rejecting our counteroffer and potentially forcing us to buy at a higher price in the final round. 

It's better to secure the product at the acceptable price point and move on."
