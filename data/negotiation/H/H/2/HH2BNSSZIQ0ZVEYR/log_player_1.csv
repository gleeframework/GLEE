"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation, but I'm also emphasizing the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $115? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget limit. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm not desperate for a sale, so I'll counteroffer again, aiming to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $111.25?  That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 111.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $109? It's a fair offer and would allow me to get the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $109 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable."", ""product_price"": 110}
