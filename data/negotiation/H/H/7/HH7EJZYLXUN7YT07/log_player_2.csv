"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $14,000. I think it would be a great fit for you and provide significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can do better than $14,000, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident in the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for you. It's less than your maximum price of $15,000, and it's reasonable considering Alice's value for the product.  Accepting this offer saves you money compared to buying from John."
