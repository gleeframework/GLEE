"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you in the long run.  To start the negotiation, I'm offering it at $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High but reasonable starting point:** Aim high to establish a strong position and leave room for negotiation. The offered price is significantly higher than the minimum, but not exorbitantly so, leaving Bob with potential profit. 
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's long-term value and potential justifies the high price in Bob's mind, making him more likely to engage.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The phrase ""to start the negotiation"" implies flexibility and willingness to consider Bob's perspective, making a rejection less likely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I see the value in this product, but  $1,350,000 is not feasible for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum and the product's worth to him. Accepting would be a substantial loss. While his counter-offer is aggressive, it signals interest. You're still in early rounds, so rejecting and countering allows you to negotiate towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the immense value this product offers while acknowledging your budget concerns."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:** Clearly rejecting Bob's low offer while reiterating the product's value keeps the power dynamic balanced.
* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  Lowering the price by $200,000 shows a willingness to negotiate but maintains a strong position above your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** Framing the counter-offer as a compromise encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable offer. 
* **Positive Language:**  Phrases like ""find a middle ground"" and ""acknowledging your budget concerns"" maintain a collaborative tone, crucial for successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. To be frank, I'm working with a hard limit of $900,000 for this purchase. If you're willing to work within that range, I'm very interested in closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Threshold:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still $100,000 short. Accepting now would mean leaving significant money on the table.
* **""Hard Limit"" Tactic:** Bob stating a ""hard limit"" could be a negotiation tactic. It's important not to fold immediately, as he's still expressing strong interest. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting and countering strategically, you can gauge if his ""hard limit"" is flexible and potentially secure a deal closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, and I want to find an agreement that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my sincere desire to make this deal happen.  If this price is truly unworkable, perhaps we can explore alternative deal structures or payment options?"", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Constraints:**  Showing understanding of Bob's ""hard limit"" helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Small Concession, High Value:** A smaller price reduction ($100,000) signals that you're nearing your bottom line while still offering a compromise.
* **Introducing Alternatives:**  Suggesting alternative deal structures (e.g., payment plans, performance bonuses) can unlock possibilities if Bob's budget is truly inflexible.
* **Final Push:**  The language implies this is a final push, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to make a move towards your target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, I need to be upfront.  My absolute maximum budget for this is $925,000.  That's as high as I can go. If you're open to it, I'm ready to close the deal right now at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has increased his offer slightly, but he's still significantly below your minimum. His repeated emphasis on a ""hard limit"" suggests he's unlikely to move much further. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob not budging and you losing out on John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures you achieve your minimum acceptable outcome without further negotiation risk.

While a deal with Bob close to your target price might be ideal, it's now looking less probable. Accepting John's offer is the most rational choice at this point."
