"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you in the long run.  To start the negotiation, I'm offering it at $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I see the value in this product, but  $1,350,000 is not feasible for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the immense value this product offers while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. To be frank, I'm working with a hard limit of $900,000 for this purchase. If you're willing to work within that range, I'm very interested in closing the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, and I want to find an agreement that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my sincere desire to make this deal happen.  If this price is truly unworkable, perhaps we can explore alternative deal structures or payment options?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, I need to be upfront.  My absolute maximum budget for this is $925,000.  That's as high as I can go. If you're open to it, I'm ready to close the deal right now at that price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
