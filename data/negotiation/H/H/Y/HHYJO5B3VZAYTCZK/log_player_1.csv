"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay a premium for the product. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to negotiate further and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close this deal. What about $1,012,500? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1012500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're moving closer to Bob's range but still holding firm above $1,000,000.  This shows we're willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""final offer,"" we aim to encourage Bob to act decisively now rather than continuing to negotiate for smaller increments.
* **Above John's Offer:** Even if Bob rejects this, we're still in a good position to walk away and accept John's $800,000 as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $975,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($800,000) and John's standing offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could try to push Bob further, his increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely we'll get much closer to $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a very good deal and avoids a potential loss if negotiations stall."
