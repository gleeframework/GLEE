"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is still a good price for you, as it's significantly more than what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
