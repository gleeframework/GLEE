Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy**

The key here is understanding your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement).  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, making that your ""walk-away"" point in negotiations with Bob.  

While you know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, you don't want to immediately start there. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more, especially if the product is unique and not easily obtainable elsewhere.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1750000
} 
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Starting Point:** $1,750,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and your guaranteed offer. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit. 
* **Justification of Value:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reinforces that the product is worth a premium. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** Phrases like ""Let me know your thoughts"" and ""we can discuss further"" signal your willingness to negotiate without seeming desperate.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price strategically based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers. Remember, your goal is to maximize profit while staying above your $1,500,000 safety net."
