"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $900,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who is willing to make a significant investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to work with you,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking for a premium price for this product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account the gap between our initial offers.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute top limit.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and allows us to finalize this deal without further delay.",800000.0,Bob,4,
