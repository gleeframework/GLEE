Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $900,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to work with you,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account the gap between our initial offers."", ""product_price"": 825000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute top limit.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and allows us to finalize this deal without further delay.
