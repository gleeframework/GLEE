"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it holds for your business.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value, $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13000 is below my minimum, I'm open to finding a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $17000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for compromise.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $17000 is still a bit high for me. To make this work, I'm offering $15500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value and allows us both to come to an agreement.  What do you think?",15500.0,Bob,4,
