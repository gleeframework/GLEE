Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it holds for your business.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value, $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I won't settle for anything less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is below my minimum, I'm open to finding a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $17,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $17000 is still a bit high for me. To make this work, I'm offering $15500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value and allows us both to come to an agreement.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $15,500 is above my minimum of $15,000 and it seems like Bob is genuinely interested in purchasing the product.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $15,000."
