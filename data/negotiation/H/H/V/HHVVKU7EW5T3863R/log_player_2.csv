Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it holds for your business.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value, $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13000 is below my minimum, I'm open to finding a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $17000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for compromise.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above my budget of $15,000. I want to see if I can negotiate further, but I'm getting closer to my limit. It's time to counteroffer again."
