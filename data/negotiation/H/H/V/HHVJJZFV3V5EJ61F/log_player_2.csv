"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer of $120 is the best first step.  You'll then have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  How about $90? "", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, though. I'm willing to go down to $105.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're still trying to save money.  While $105 is better than the initial $120, you can still potentially get it for less.  Rejecting Alice's offer will allow you to make another counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your target price."
