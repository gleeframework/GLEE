Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to keep my minimum profit in mind. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great price for this product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, so how about $120? That's a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, his offer of $120 is still below my minimum.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my desired profit. It's a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
