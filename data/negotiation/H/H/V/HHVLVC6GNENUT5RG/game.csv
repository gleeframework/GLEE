"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe its value to you could be even higher. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. This is my maximum budget, and I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1300000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1300000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit short of what this product is truly worth.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1200000?  This is a reasonable price considering the value you'll gain from owning this product. Let's close this deal and avoid any further back-and-forth.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
