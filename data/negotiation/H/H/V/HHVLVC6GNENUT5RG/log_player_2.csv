The product is too expensive at $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still too high. I'm going to try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit short of what this product is truly worth.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1200000?  This is a reasonable price considering the value you'll gain from owning this product. Let's close this deal and avoid any further back-and-forth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While $1,200,000 is still more than I wanted to pay, it's closer to my maximum budget. If I reject, we'll likely go back and forth more, and I'm not sure Alice will budge much further. It's better to take this offer than to risk going back to John and paying $1,000,000."
