{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe its value to you could be even higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the potential value of the product to Bob, hinting that it could be even more valuable to him than my asking price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price, encouraging Bob to counteroffer. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation and avoiding a quick rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. This is my maximum budget, and I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While selling to John for $1,200,000 is an option, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's position:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's budget limitations, showing that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Maintain value:**  I emphasize the product's value, justifying my counteroffer and establishing a middle ground. 
* **Concrete price:** I present a specific price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value while leaving room for further negotiation.  

This approach aims to find a compromise while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1300000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  There's still potential to negotiate a better deal, as Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to explore a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit short of what this product is truly worth.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This is a reasonable price considering the value you'll gain from owning this product. Let's close this deal and avoid any further back-and-forth."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Appeal to fairness:** I emphasize a fair price for both of us, creating a sense of compromise and urgency.
* **Meet in the middle:**  I suggest a specific price that's the midpoint between our last offers, making it a logical and neutral proposal.
* **Urgency and finality:** I mention closing the deal and avoiding further back-and-forth to encourage Bob to accept.  

By proposing a ""final"" price that meets my minimum value, I aim to close the deal while also acknowledging Bob's budgetary constraints."
