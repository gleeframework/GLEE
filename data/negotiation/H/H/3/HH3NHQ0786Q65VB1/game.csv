"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has even greater value to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is significantly lower than my starting point, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000.  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,025,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $950,000 is still too low.  How about $975,000? It's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this.",975000.0,Alice,5,
