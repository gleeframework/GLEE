"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'll counter with a higher price, but I'm still open to selling to John if the negotiations don't progress."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is significantly lower than my starting point, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000.  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,025,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob is still quite a bit below my minimum, but closer than before. I will make another counteroffer, but if the price doesn't move closer to my desired amount, I'll sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $950,000 is still too low.  How about $975,000? It's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this."", ""product_price"": 975000}
