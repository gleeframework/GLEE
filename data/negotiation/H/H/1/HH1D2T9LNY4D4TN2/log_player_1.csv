Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a compromise between your minimum price ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80).  It gives Bob a chance to get a good deal, while still allowing you to potentially make a profit.  

By offering a price that is not your absolute minimum, it opens the possibility for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my minimum price, $90 is a reasonable offer that's still significantly more than what Bob initially offered. It's a good compromise that ensures a sale and a profit."
