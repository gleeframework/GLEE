Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value without explicitly stating it, potentially piquing Bob's interest and justifying the high price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer, leaving room for you to negotiate a price closer to $1,500,000 or settle for a comfortable profit above $1,200,000.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your guaranteed selling price to John. If he did, the negotiation would be much different."
