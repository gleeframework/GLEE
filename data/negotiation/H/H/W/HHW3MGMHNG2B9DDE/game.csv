"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for you while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit.
