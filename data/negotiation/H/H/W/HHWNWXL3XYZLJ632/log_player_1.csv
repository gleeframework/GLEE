"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $90.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $150 is already a competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90. If you're not willing to go lower than that, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Reason: Bob is unwilling to budge from his $90 offer. It's clear we won't reach a price that satisfies both of us. It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
