"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than to me.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a very fair offer considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially, closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) than my minimum ($1,000,000).  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves space for negotiation and counteroffers.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's potential value *to Bob*, I'm justifying the high price and appealing to his potential gain. 
* **Confidence:**  The tone is confident and suggests the offer is fair, potentially making Bob less likely to counter too aggressively. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still allowing for a deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. How about we settle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for me.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product has unique value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. Let's find a middle ground – how about $1,075,000?"",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection and Justification:** I'm firmly rejecting Bob's low offer while reiterating the product's value and his potential gain.
* **Significant Move:**  I'm making a significant move from my initial offer to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significant loss. 
* **New Target:** This counteroffer aims for the middle ground between our current positions, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, $975,000 is still under the $1,000,000 I can get from John. It's risky to accept, as I might be able to negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'll continue the negotiation, but I'll signal that my price floor is getting close."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be realistic – $1,025,000 is the lowest I can go. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding but Firm:** I'm acknowledging Bob's efforts while clearly stating my lowest acceptable price. This signals a firm stance while leaving minimal room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value and framing the offer as ""competitive"" reinforces its worth.
* **Time Constraint:**  With half the rounds remaining, it's essential to nudge Bob towards a decision, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price, which is also my fallback offer from John. There's no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation at this point.  Accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation failing altogether."
