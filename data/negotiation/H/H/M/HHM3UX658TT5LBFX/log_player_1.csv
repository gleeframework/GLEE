"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the tone for negotiation and gives me room to lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are too low for me to accept. I've made significant concessions, but I'm unwilling to go below my minimum price.  With only two rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating.  Selling to John is the best option to ensure I get the price I need for the product."
