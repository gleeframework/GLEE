"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $105? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be.",105.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $100? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product is worth $80 to you.,100.0,Bob,4,
