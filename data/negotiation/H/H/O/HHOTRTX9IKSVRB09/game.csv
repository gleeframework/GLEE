,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
