It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is conceding much smaller amounts now. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significant savings.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  You could end up having to buy from John at the full price. 
* **Reasonable Price:** $1,090,000 is a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price.

While you might be able to squeeze a few thousand more in savings, it's not worth the risk at this point.  Accept the offer and secure a good deal."
