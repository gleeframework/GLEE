Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, and $7,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000. Let's try $10,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement at this price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. That said, $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500, but that's really the most I can do.  What do you say?"",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $10,000, which is the lowest price I can accept. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $10,000.  You've reached a point where cutting your losses and going with the guaranteed $8,000 from John is the smarter move."
