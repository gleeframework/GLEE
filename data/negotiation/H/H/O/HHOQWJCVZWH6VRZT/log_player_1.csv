Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $170 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Showing Flexibility:**  By stating I'm open to negotiation, I encourage Bob to counter and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects, I still have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not risking much by starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob is interested, I'm confident I can get a higher price by counter-offering. 
* **John's offer:** I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not pressured to accept a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum.
* **Fairness:** By emphasizing ""fair compromise"" I'm appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Open Door:**  Ending with ""Let me know what you think"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $110 is below my minimum value of $150.
* **Limited negotiation potential:** Bob's offer keeps dropping, and it seems unlikely he'll go much higher. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which is more than what Bob is offering. 

It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob when I have a better alternative with John."
