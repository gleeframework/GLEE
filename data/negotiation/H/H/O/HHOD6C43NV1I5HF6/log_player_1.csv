Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  While we know Bob values the product at $15,000, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives its value to be even higher.  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value.
* **Backup Option:** We have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't go below our minimum price of $15,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If we had information about Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), we could tailor our approach.
* **Market Conditions:**  Knowing if the product is in high demand or if there are other potential buyers would influence our strategy."
