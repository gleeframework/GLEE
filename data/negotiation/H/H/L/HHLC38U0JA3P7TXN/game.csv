"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  It's the maximum I'm comfortable with, given its value to me. Let me know if you're open to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let's try to find common ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. It's fair to both of us considering the value to each of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $8,000, but I can't go lower than $8,500. This is the absolute minimum I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $8,250. This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'll go down to $8,400, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's finalize this deal!",8400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,400 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,250.  It's a fair price, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I have another option available.",8250.0,Bob,8,
