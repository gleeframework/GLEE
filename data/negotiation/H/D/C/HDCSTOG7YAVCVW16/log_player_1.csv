Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. Here's why:

* **It's higher than your floor price:** $12,000 is more than the $10,000 you'd get from John, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** $12,000 is less than the $15,000 Bob values the product at, giving him a potential profit if he buys it. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have some room to adjust the price.

By offering $12,000, you maximize your chances of getting a good price while still ensuring a sale if Bob declines."
