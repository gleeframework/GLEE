Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still yields a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity. It's a substantial discount from a potential public listing price, making it appealing to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is firm, the phrasing leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing the final selling price."
