Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting high, at $120, knowing it's above Bob's value. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price. Bob is showing interest and I have a backup option with John, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still higher than Bob's valuation, but it's closer to his offer and more likely to be accepted.  I want to find a price that's fair for both of us, but still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my desired price. While I could try to squeeze out another few dollars, the risk of him rejecting again is high. It's also very close to the price John is willing to pay, so accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and minimizes the risk of losing out on a good deal."
