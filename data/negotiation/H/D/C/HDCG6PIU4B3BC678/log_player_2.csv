"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$750,000 is a good price, but I can potentially get it for even cheaper.  It's worth exploring further negotiation with Alice before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate seriously.  If she rejects this, I'll adjust my counteroffer in the next round based on her reaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but I'm still hopeful I can get it for less. I'll counteroffer again, but this time I'll be a bit more conservative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm serious about negotiating but still aiming for a price lower than her current offer. This is a middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price range, and we are getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds.  At this point, accepting her offer of $650,000 is a good deal.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or I'll run out of rounds before reaching an agreement."
