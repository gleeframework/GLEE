"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is far outside my budget. Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the price gap between our positions is quite large. I'm confident that we can find a more agreeable price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this is a significant move on my end, demonstrating my desire to close this deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach a deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we should try to avoid too many more rounds.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. It's important to me that this product goes to someone who truly values it.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,550,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal now.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
