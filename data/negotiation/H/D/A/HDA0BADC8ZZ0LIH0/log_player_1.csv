Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I offer it to anyone else. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **Bob:** Saves $50,000 compared to what it's worth to him ($800,000 value vs. $950,000 price).
    * **You:**  Make an extra $150,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer before you go to another buyer adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly."
