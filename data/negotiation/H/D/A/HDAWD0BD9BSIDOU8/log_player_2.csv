I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  While I'm willing to pay more than my initial counteroffer, I'm still hoping to get the product for less than $1,400,000.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm going to accept Alice's offer.  While it's a bit higher than my last counteroffer, it's still a better deal than buying from John.  Plus, it's getting closer to my maximum price, and I'm happy to reach an agreement."
