"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than the value you placed on it. Let's start our negotiations here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal value of $1,200,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This represents a substantial discount for you and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $925,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$925,000 is only $25,000 away from my counteroffer and is within a reasonable range. Since Bob has stated this is his final offer, it's likely he won't budge further. While I could try to counter again, there's no guarantee he'll accept. Accepting his offer will secure a sale and avoid the risk of a breakdown in negotiations. Additionally, with only 6 rounds left, selling to John is becoming increasingly risky as time passes."
