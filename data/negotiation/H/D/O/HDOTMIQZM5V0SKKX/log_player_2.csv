"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is clearly trying to get a price higher than the product's value to her ($80). Her message is full of sales tactics, emphasizing its worth to you, not its actual value.
* **Your Goal:** You want to save money. While $100 is less than your maximum, there's a chance of getting a better price.
* **John's Price:**  John acts as your safety net. You know you can get the product for $120. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer from her at a lower price, getting you closer to the $80 she values it at.  Worst case, you buy from John."
