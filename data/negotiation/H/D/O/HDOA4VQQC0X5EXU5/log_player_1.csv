Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $18,000}

This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping Bob will find it reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as that's below my minimum price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Considering his previous offer of $10,000, I'm willing to meet him halfway. I'll offer:

{""product_price"": $14,000}

This is a compromise that's closer to my original price, but still a bit more flexible than my initial offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'll try to get a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's getting closer to my minimum price, I'll try to nudge him up a bit more. I'll offer:

{""product_price"": $13,500}

This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me at this price. Let's see if he's willing to compromise further."
