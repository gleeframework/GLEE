"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $900,000 is certainly a respectable offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right number. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
