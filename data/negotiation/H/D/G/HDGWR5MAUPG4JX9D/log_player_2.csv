Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $100, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  While the product might be good, it's not worth the extra $20 to me.  I'll go with John's offer."
