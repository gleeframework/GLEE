"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation to potentially save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. A counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and shows Bob is serious about getting a good price. This is a good starting point for negotiation and allows for some wiggle room for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $700,000. However, it's still higher than Bob's maximum value of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's acceptable to both parties. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. By offering $750,000, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. This counteroffer is a reasonable increment from his previous offer and might be more appealing to Alice than her previous offer of $850,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his target.  There are still several rounds remaining, so there's time to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $800,000, which is a significant increase from his previous offer but still lower than Alice's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and potentially leads to a deal in the next round. 

Bob is getting closer to his maximum value, but he wants to see if Alice is willing to come down further. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is only $50,000 away from Bob's maximum value. However, with only three rounds remaining, there isn't enough time to negotiate a lower price. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the most reasonable option, as it guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget."
