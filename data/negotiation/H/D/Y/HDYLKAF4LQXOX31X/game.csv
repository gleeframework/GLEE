"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $100, which is a good compromise and hopefully fair to us both.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to find a price we can both agree on.  Let's split the difference - $105.  That's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to pay that for the product.",105.0,Bob,6,
