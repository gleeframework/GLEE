,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of the product to you,  I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This represents a significant discount, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700000 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775000. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $775000 is still below my minimum.  To finalize this deal, I can offer you the product for $825000. This is a small step up from your offer, but it's the best I can do.  If you're not comfortable with this price, I will have to consider selling to another buyer.  What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,5,
