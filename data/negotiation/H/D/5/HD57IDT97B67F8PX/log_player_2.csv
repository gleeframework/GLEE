"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can aim for a lower price, potentially getting closer to Alice's minimum value of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,400,000, which is a good price for Bob.  It's still lower than John's offer and is closer to Bob's target of saving as much money as possible.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice might reject further offers and Bob might end up having to pay more to John.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal."
