Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and it also shows him that I believe the product is valuable.  I'm confident in my product and willing to be flexible, but I want to maximize my profit.  I'll be ready to counter if he comes back with a lower offer, and I'll always have the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
