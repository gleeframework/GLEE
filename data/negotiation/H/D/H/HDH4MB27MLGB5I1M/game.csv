"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $10,000 for the product. This still allows me to save some money while being fair to you. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
