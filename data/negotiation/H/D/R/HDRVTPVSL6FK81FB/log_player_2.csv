"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $950000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Bob should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price.  There's no harm in trying!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the rarity of this product, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $875,000 is a good price considering Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's a significant saving compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer is the best choice in this situation."
