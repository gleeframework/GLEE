"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway, or if he'll make a counteroffer closer to his value.  I'm also leaving the door open for negotiation by using the phrase ""confident you'll find it useful,"" which implies there's value in the product beyond just its base worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum value of $120, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I can try to push for a higher price in the next round, or if he remains firm at $90, I can choose to sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. By emphasizing ""fair price"" and ""good deal"" for both of us, I'm aiming to appeal to his sense of fairness and encourage him to accept this offer.  I'm still leaving some wiggle room for potential negotiation in the following rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position. I am willing to pay $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $92. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round. If he doesn't budge, I'm ready to sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we split the difference and settle on $93? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 93}
```

I'm going to try and close the deal with a final offer of $93. I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and hopefully secure the sale. It's still above my minimum but close enough to my desired price. If he rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. I am willing to pay $91 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. It's clear that Bob is not going to budge much further.  Even though I'm slightly above my minimum value, I'd rather take the guaranteed $120 from John."
