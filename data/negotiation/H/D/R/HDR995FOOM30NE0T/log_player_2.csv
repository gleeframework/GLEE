"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,350,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still within Bob's budget.  This should start a more serious negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's a slight concession from her previous offer, it's not enough for Bob.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There is still a chance to get a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is acceptable to both parties.  This counteroffer is a slight increase from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It's still below Alice's current offer, but closer to her value, making it more likely that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than Bob's maximum budget. While there's still room for negotiation, it's getting increasingly likely that the final price will be above what Bob is willing to pay. Given that John is offering the product at Bob's maximum budget, it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
