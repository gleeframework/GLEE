Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $880000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with, and it's still a great price for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is within my budget and a significant improvement from her previous offers.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees me a good deal within my budget."
