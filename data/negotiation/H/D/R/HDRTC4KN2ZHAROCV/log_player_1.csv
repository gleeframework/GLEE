"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,350,000 is a good offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's valuation is significantly higher, so I'll try to push for a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,350,000 is lower than I'd be comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This reflects the product's significant value while still being a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher on my target price. I'd be willing to consider $1,325,000, which is a significant discount from my initial thoughts. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $1,325,000 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's time to close the deal."
