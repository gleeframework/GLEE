Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product truly is exceptional and provides a lot of value, which I'm sure you'll agree with once you experience it.
