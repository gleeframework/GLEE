"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also being optimistic about the value of the product for Bob, hoping to capitalize on his potential need."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate and I can always sell to John for $15,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, showing flexibility, but still keeping it above my minimum. My message is friendly and focuses on finding a compromise, which can be helpful in building rapport during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $16,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is close to my minimum value of $15,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's also important to consider that I could always sell to John for $15,000. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
