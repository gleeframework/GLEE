Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you've been interested in.  I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $7,000 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'd be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and meet at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, I'm still not at a price that feels fair to me. I have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $8,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting quite close to John's offer. I'm willing to pay $7,900, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, his final offer is still too low for me.  Given John is willing to pay my minimum price, it makes sense to accept his offer."
