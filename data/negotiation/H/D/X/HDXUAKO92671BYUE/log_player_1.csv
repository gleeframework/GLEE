Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Selling to John right now guarantees me that amount, and I'm not willing to risk settling for less. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. However, $850,000 is still too far below the value I place on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which reflects both the value I see in it and your need for a fair price. This offer is my best, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair compromise and keeps us both within reasonable margins. Let's reach a deal on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal target. I'm willing to see if I can push for a higher price with Bob in the next round, as I'm confident I can get a better deal with him.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John at $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer to where we need to be, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product and allows us both to benefit. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
