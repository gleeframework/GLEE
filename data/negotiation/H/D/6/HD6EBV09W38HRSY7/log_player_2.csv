"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer. He's offering $130, which is $10 less than Alice's offer. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a fair price. It's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's counteroffer, but still provides her with a profit.  Bob can secure the product for a price within his budget and avoid the risk of further negotiation or buying from John at a higher price."
