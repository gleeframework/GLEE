"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Can you meet me in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,000,000. I'd like to make a more aggressive counteroffer of $1,600,000. I'm willing to walk away if this price isn't acceptable to you.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
