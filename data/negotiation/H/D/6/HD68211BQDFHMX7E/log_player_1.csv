Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate a bit. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This is a strong offer, and I need to see some movement on your end to justify going any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is not increasing significantly enough to warrant continuing the negotiation. He's still far below the product's value to me and even further from my original offers.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price, avoiding further time and potential losses in a drawn-out negotiation."
