"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to charge at least $13,000 to make it worth my while. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before going with John.  It's worth seeing if we can reach a compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already had another buyer interested in the product, and I need to consider that. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good deal, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. Even though the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, it's not worth pushing further for a lower price.  I can get the same product from John for a guaranteed $10,000, so it's time to move on."
