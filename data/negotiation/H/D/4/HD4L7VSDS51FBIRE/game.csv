"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. Can you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,040,000 as a compromise. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,040,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $1,040,000. Can you consider $1,032,500?",1032500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might be too far apart on price. While I'm happy to negotiate,  $1,032,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's try $1,037,500. If this doesn't work, I might have to consider other options.",1037500.0,Alice,7,
