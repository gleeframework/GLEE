Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering a price above Bob's perceived value ($100) gives me room to negotiate.
* **Room to Compromise:** $175 is still below my minimum price ($150) so I have flexibility to lower the price if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** There's room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm open to negotiation, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  $140 is a middle ground between Bob's offer and my minimum price, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly approach to keep the negotiation open and encouraging.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" emphasizing that it's a good deal for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum price:** While $130 is getting closer to my minimum price of $150, it's still below my desired range.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in further price reductions, and I'm not sure if I'm willing to risk losing even more money.
* **Guaranteed sale with John:** Selling to John guarantees a price of $150, which is above my minimum and a safe choice."
