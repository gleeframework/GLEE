This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000, but I'm willing to negotiate.  By offering a price slightly below what I know it's worth to Bob, I'm showing him I'm open to negotiation, which can encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something around $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I would get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is still a significant profit, it's lower than my desired outcome. I'm confident I can push for a higher price by counteroffering."

Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob."

I'm choosing to sell the product to John. While I would have preferred to sell to Bob for a higher price, we've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.  Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
