Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000} 
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  With only one round left, the risk of rejecting and ending up buying from John for $1,000,000 is too high. $487,500 is a good price, and while I might be able to squeeze a little more, it's not worth the gamble.  I've managed to save over $500,000 compared to buying from John."
