"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to go up to $10000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit high with $15000.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500?  Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,4,
