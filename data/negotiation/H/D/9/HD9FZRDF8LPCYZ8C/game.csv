"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to pay $14,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $15,500, which is a fair compromise. I'm sure we can both be happy with this price.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Let's try $15,250. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with this deal.",15250.0,Bob,6,
