"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $12,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get the best possible price. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows us to close this deal quickly. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $13,800. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $13,800 is still higher than her own valuation of $12,000, but it's lower than Bob's initial willingness to pay $15,000 and much better than John's $15,000 price. This is a good compromise, and Bob should accept the offer to save $1,200 compared to buying from John."
