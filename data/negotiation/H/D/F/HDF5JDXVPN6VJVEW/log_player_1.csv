Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is advantageous, but we don't want to scare him off.** Offering it at his maximum value ($10,000) leaves no room for profit.
* **We start high to test the waters.** The $19,000 offer is significantly above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Our backup plan (John) ensures we won't settle for less than $15,000.**  This allows us to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Excellent! We've made a significant profit.
* **Bob negotiates:** This opens the door for a back-and-forth where we can potentially still settle above $15,000.
* **Bob rejects:** No problem. We move on to John, securing our minimum desired price."
