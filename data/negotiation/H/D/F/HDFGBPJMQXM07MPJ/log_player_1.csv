"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal happen. How about we settle at $875,000? This reflects the product's true value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $780,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $800,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed $800,000 which is better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a lower final offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed profit."
