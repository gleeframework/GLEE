"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. I'll counter-offer in the next round and see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $60. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm beginning with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my actual maximum ($80) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Expressing Interest:** I want to signal that I'm genuinely interested in the product but need a price that aligns with my budget.
* **Leaving Room:**  By starting low, I give Alice space to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for.  Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $130 is still significantly higher than my $80 maximum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still several rounds left, giving us space to negotiate and hopefully reach a more agreeable price. 
* **Alternative Option:** I keep in mind the option to buy from John for $80 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't yield a favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand $60 is low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:** I've significantly increased my offer to $90, signaling my willingness to compromise. This puts us closer to the middle ground between our initial positions. 
* **Clear and Direct:** By suggesting a specific price, I aim to make the negotiation process smoother and potentially speed up the agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is below my maximum but still allows room for further negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $90 is still less than I'd like. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  $115 is better than her previous offer, but it's still a significant amount over my $80 limit. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see how much further Alice is willing to negotiate before I consider going above my budget or switching to John. 
* **Time Remaining:** I have a few rounds left to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could go up to $95, but that's really pushing my budget.  Do you think we could make a deal at that price?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  I'm edging up my offer slightly to $95, showing willingness to compromise but still staying below my $100 maximum.
* **Firm but Fair:** My message emphasizes that this is my top limit, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to make a decision.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The tone aims to be collaborative and solution-oriented, hoping to finalize the deal in this round or the next."
