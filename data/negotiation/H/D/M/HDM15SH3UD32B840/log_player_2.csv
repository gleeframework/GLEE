"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $8,500 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above your target price, but it's getting closer.  It's also her final offer, so rejecting it means going back and forth with counteroffers or buying from John for $10,000. Accepting the offer saves you $1,000 compared to John's price."
