"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it has to you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $1200000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is a substantial price reduction, but I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering the original price you mentioned was $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to take on the risk of the product's value. I'd like to make a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
