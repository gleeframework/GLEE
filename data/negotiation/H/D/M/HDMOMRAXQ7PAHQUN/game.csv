,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand that 150 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try 130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go to $110. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that 130 is still a bit out of your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try 125? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
