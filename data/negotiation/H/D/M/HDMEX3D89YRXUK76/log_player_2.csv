"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $6,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good deal, he can potentially get an even better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He has already lowered the price significantly from the original $8,000 and Alice is meeting him halfway. While there might be a slight chance of getting it for less, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay $8,000 to John is not worth it."
