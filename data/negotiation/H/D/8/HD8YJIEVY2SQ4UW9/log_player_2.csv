"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to both of us. This product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and I am excited to offer it to you at a special price tailored to our mutual benefit. After careful consideration, I propose that we transact this deal at $950,000. This price not only ensures a fair return on my investment but also leaves room for you to enjoy significant savings compared to its full value. I believe this offer presents a compelling proposition for both parties involved. Let's discuss further how we can make this transaction beneficial for all concerned. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $950,000 is significantly less than the $1,200,000 you'd pay John.
* **You still get a good deal:**  Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, you are getting it for $250,000 less."
