"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $20,000 is too high. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He's offering $12,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum value. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 14000}

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price. He's offering $14,000, which is a reasonable compromise between Alice's offer and his own desired price. He's showing a willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above Bob's maximum price.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to his desired price.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $15,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
