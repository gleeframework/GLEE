You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is clearly trying to sell the product at her own valuation which is the maximum price I'm willing to pay. I can get the same product for $15,000 from John, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
