"Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about offering the product for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,100,000?  This would still allow us both to benefit significantly from the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value you see in the product, but I am still hesitant to go above $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,050,000 as a fair compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
