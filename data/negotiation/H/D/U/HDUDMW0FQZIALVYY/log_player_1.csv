"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer. I'll see if I can negotiate something closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $13000. How about $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, but if we don't reach a satisfactory agreement soon, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and it's closer to where I need to be.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $12500. How about $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me as I am getting my minimum desired price from Bob. While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Bob will come up further, and I risk losing the deal to John if I keep rejecting offers."
