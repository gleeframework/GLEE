"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 simply isn't enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a good price for both of us. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
