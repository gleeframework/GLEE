{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point that allows for a potential deal without immediately jeopardizing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can come to an agreement at $8500 for the product. I hope this meets within your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and ensures a sale. Accepting his offer is the most logical choice to maximize profit without risking the sale to John."
