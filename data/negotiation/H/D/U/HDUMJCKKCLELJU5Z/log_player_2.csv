"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find immense value in. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value, $950,000 is a bit high for me. I would be willing to pay $700,000."", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer significantly lower than the seller's initial price, but still within a reasonable range.
* **Leaving Room:**  This offer gives room for negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it opens the door for her to counter.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing we can buy the product for $1,000,000 from John gives us a strong fallback position. We don't want to drag the negotiation out too long and risk losing out on a reasonable deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved towards our offer, $875,000 is still significantly higher than both her value ($800,000) and our initial counteroffer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's message suggests she's willing to negotiate further.  We need to show we're also willing to move, but not too quickly.
* **John as a Backstop:**  We're still comfortable walking away and buying from John for $1,000,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $875,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price that's a bit more comfortable for me. How about we settle at $775,000?"", ""product_price"": 775000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We are increasing our offer, but by a smaller increment than Alice's last move. This shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains a firm stance. 
* **Target Range:** $775,000 puts us in a range that's a good deal for us if accepted, but still leaves room for a final compromise if needed.
* **Deadline Pressure:** We're moving closer to Alice's likely ""walk away"" point, so this offer adds a bit of pressure to close the deal."
