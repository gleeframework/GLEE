"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $1000000. This is a great deal considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand that you're still a bit below your target, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $920000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you $930000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
