{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's not too aggressive:**  $120 is a decent discount from your minimum desired price ($150) but it's not so low that it leaves no room for negotiation.
* **It's open-ended:** The message leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling pressured. 
* **It emphasizes value:**  The message subtly points out that the product is valuable, which could increase Bob's perception of its worth.

Let me know what happens with Bob's response and we can adjust your strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is more than Bob's perceived value of the product, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $150. You can likely get a better deal by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **It's a compromise:**  It's halfway between your previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $105 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **It reinforces your value:** You're still emphasizing the value of the product, reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal at $105.
* **It's open-ended:** The message encourages further negotiation but leaves the door open to a quick agreement.

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you do $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a good offer, it's still below your minimum desired price of $150. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target.  You've already shown flexibility, and Bob is clearly interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go down to $110, which is a great deal for both of us.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

Here's why this final counteroffer makes sense:

* **It's a small compromise:** You're only dropping your price by $5 from your previous offer.
* **It's still above your minimum:** $110 is still more than your minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **It emphasizes finality:** You're letting Bob know this is your final offer, which could encourage him to accept.
* **It's polite but firm:** You acknowledge Bob's negotiation but stand your ground.

This final counteroffer gives you a good chance of securing a sale without compromising too much. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $110, but I'm willing to meet you at $100 again. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses and sell to John. You've already made several concessions and Bob is unwilling to budge.  While $100 is better than nothing, you're still below your minimum desired price and John is offering a guaranteed $150.  It's better to move on and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
