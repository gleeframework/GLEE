Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its value."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  He values it at $150, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a price that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'll counter Bob and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $100. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $105? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  $105 is a good deal considering the alternative is selling to John for $80. It's also close to my desired price point, making it a fair compromise."
