"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is above my maximum valuation. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $850,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair offer considering my budget."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price to provide room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I've included a brief, polite justification for my counteroffer, mentioning my budget.
* **Objective:** My goal is to purchase the product for significantly less than my maximum valuation of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is too far below the product's worth.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Limit:** Alice has come down to my maximum valuation of $800,000. 
* **John's Price:** John is also offering the product for $800,000.
* **Limited Upside:** Continuing negotiations might not yield a significantly better price, and there's a risk Alice might increase her offer.

It makes sense to accept Alice's offer now."
