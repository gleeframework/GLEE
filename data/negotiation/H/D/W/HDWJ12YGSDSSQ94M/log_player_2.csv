"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $800,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $600,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $700,000. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'll reject the offer and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $700,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $650,000. Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $675,000. It's getting close to the value it holds for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting close to my ideal price point. While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, at this point the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially reaching a stalemate (or even worse, her going back to her previous offer of $700,000) outweighs the potential benefit. It's better to lock in this deal and save myself the time and effort of further negotiation."
