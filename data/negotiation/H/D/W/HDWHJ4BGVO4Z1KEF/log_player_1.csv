Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $100 is more than the $80 Bob is willing to pay, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $100 is below your minimum of $120, meaning you'd still make a profit.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to discuss the price. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Try to get closer to my target price:** I can counter with a price closer to $120, hopefully finding a middle ground.
* **Assess Bob's seriousness:** If he's truly interested, he'll likely counter again, showing his willingness to negotiate further.

**Note:** The decision to reject Bob's offer is based on the goal of maximizing profit. While selling to John guarantees $120, continuing with Bob might yield a higher price, albeit with a risk of ultimately ending up with a lower price or no sale at all."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more breathing room."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Middle Ground:**  $95 is a midpoint between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasizing ""good deal"" for Bob increases the chance he'll accept.

This strategy aims to find a mutually agreeable price without immediately resorting to selling to John."
