"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but we're open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for a value that benefits both of us. How about we start at $100 for this exceptional item?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and your interest, how about we agree on $90 for this item? This price reflects a balance between our expectations and your budget.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my limit.  Let's split the difference at $87.50.  This would allow us both to close the deal fairly.",87.5,Bob,4,
