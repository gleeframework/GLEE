,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $110 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $65 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, say $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. How about $85? This would be a great deal for you, and I'd still be able to make a good profit.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $85 is getting closer, but I'm really trying to stay under $80.  Would you be willing to do $78? That's my final offer.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $78 is still a bit below what I can reasonably accept. I'm willing to go down to $82. This is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal.",82.0,Alice,7,
