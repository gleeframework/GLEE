"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $2000000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we perhaps aim for something closer to $1800000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm offering you a price of $1900000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that the product's value justifies a price above $1700000. Let's try $1750000 as my final counteroffer.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1800000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $1725000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think?",1725000.0,Alice,5,
