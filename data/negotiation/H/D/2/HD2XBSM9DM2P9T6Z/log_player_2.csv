"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let me know your thoughts.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and it would still leave you with a substantial profit margin. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your continued interest.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true worth while also being fair to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price near my budget. I've made a fair offer at $1,050,000, and she's still significantly higher.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $1,000,000."
