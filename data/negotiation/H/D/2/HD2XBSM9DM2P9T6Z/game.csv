"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering I have other options.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but  $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer $900,000. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and it would still leave you with a substantial profit margin. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while respecting the value it holds.  Let me know if this works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your continued interest.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true worth while also being fair to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen.
