Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""amazing"" to make the product sound appealing.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage and potentially counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and assess whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay $110 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  While I'm open to negotiation, $110 is too low for me.
* **Selling to John is a better option at this time.** John is guaranteed to pay my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out.

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net.
* By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This can potentially push Bob to offer a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language like ""split the difference"" and ""happy"" to make the counter-offer sound reasonable and agreeable.
* **Direct and Concise:** I'm getting straight to the point with the counter-offer and not dragging the negotiation out.

**Strategy:**

* **Aiming for a Compromise:** I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of a compromise and accept this price.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to evaluate whether to make another counteroffer or simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I can't go above $115 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While he's come up a little from his previous offer, $115 is still too low.
* **John's offer is a sure thing.** I'm guaranteed to get my minimum price of $150 by selling to John.
* **Negotiating further with Bob carries risk.**  There's no guarantee that he'll budge further, and I could end up losing time and potentially getting a worse price.

**Strategy:**

* I'm prioritizing certainty and minimizing risk.
* Selling to John ensures I get the best possible outcome at this point."
