"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to offer you $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us make this deal work. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
