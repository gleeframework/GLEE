Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, but I'm afraid I'm at my limit. I can do $13,500.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to go above $13,500. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a real risk he won't budge.  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, which is a better outcome than potentially losing both Bob and John in further rounds."
