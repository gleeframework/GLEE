"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product of immense value. While I cannot disclose the exact nature of the product, I assure you it's worth far more than the price I'm offering.  Consider this an exclusive deal at $1500000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, given the product's potential. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to consider a deal, but I need to be more competitive. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1200000 is a significant amount, I'm confident this product holds greater potential.  Let's find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects a considerable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique attributes. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering $1250000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1250000 is a reasonable offer, I'm still confident in the value of this product.  I'm prepared to make a final concession, but I need to stay above a certain threshold to make this deal worthwhile.  My final offer is $1300000.  This price represents a considerable compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'm counteroffering $1290000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
