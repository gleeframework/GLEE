Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the return on investment you'll experience."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can meet Bob somewhere in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?  This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

We're getting close, but we're still leaving a significant amount on the table compared to John's offer. Let's push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers.  Let's close this deal. How about $1,275,000? This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,260,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's getting riskier. Accepting $1,260,000 is a strong profit and avoids the risk of him walking away or our negotiations stalling."
