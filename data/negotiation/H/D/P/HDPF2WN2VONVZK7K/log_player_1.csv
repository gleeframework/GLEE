Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with a price of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Let's try $87 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $87 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's better to secure the deal now than risk Bob lowering his offer or walking away."
