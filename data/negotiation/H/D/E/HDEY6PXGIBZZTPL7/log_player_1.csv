"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit, and I believe this product is worth more than $10,000 to Bob, given he's expressed interest. 

By starting high, I establish a strong initial position and hopefully get Bob to focus on that number rather than the minimum value I would accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than my absolute minimum of $10,000, I believe I can get a better price.  I know this product is worth more to me than that, and Bob's initial rejection of my $15,000 offer shows he's willing to negotiate. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm dropping my price to $12,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for potential negotiation. I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair, considering Bob's counteroffer and the fact that I'm still making a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more,  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer. I also know that John is willing to pay the same amount, so there's no benefit in continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's time to secure the deal and move on."
