"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen. ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $925,000. That's the highest I can go. Let's see if we can make it work.",925000.0,Bob,4,
