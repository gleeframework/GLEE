# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $825,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new offer of $795,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

```

**Reasoning:** Alice is very unlikely to go below $795,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation rounds.  While there's a tiny chance of getting the price down a little more with Alice, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of Alice raising her price or the negotiation dragging on."
