Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $12,875. Would you consider $12,687.50? I think this is a fair compromise.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $12,687.50 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Exceeds the alternative:** This offer surpasses the guaranteed $12,000 from John. 
* **Diminishing returns:**  Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing Bob and settling for John's offer increases.
* **Time value of money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate returns, whereas further haggling delays the income. 

This acceptance reflects a balance between maximizing profit and mitigating the risk of losing a good deal."
