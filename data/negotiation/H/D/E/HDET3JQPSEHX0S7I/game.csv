"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond the current market.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this simple: $1,225,000 and we have a deal. This is my final offer.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,225,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go as low as $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. I really need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
