{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both firm on our positions. To demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1,400,000.

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge beyond $1,250,000. With only four rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I get the best possible price and eliminates any risk of ending up with a lower offer from Bob."
