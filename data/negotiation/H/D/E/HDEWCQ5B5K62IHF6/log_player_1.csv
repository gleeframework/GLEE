Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you start by aiming higher to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification:** The phrase ""immense value"" and mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of desirability and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still landing you above your minimum price. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
