"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly useful for you, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your budget, $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $13,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I still think $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to compromise?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest,  $10,500 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I could let it go for $11,500. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere for this quality.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think I'll have to look elsewhere if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",11000.0,Bob,6,
