"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was hoping to discuss a price that's a bit more reasonable for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  To demonstrate my willingness to reach a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still offers you a substantial value, and it's a fair reflection of the product's potential.
