{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget.**  You're only willing to spend $10,000. 
* **It's worth exploring negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can get Alice closer to your price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.** This keeps you in a strong negotiating position."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with your maximum.**  By offering your absolute limit, you clearly state your position and force Alice to make the first concession. 
* **Be prepared for rejection.** Alice might be unwilling to drop so much in the first round. However, you've set the stage for negotiations."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your price, but still above your budget.**  $14,000 is better than $17,000, but you still have room for negotiation.

* **John's offer is still an option.**  This keeps pressure on Alice to negotiate further."

* **Keep John's offer in mind.**  You can still walk away at any point, so Alice knows you have options."

* **John's offer still provides a fallback option.** Alice knows you have other options and needs to make a final concession."
