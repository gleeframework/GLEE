Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product.  

This strategy is based on the following considerations:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  Starting high allows for more potential profit, although it increases the risk of rejection. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** A lower starting price could limit your ability to earn more.
* **John as a backup:** The presence of John as a willing buyer at $1,500,000 gives me a safety net.  If Bob rejects my offer, I can always move on to John and secure a guaranteed profit."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1,600,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $1,600,000 is a good deal, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to push for a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it benefits both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}

I'm aiming for a middle ground. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to earn a decent profit."
