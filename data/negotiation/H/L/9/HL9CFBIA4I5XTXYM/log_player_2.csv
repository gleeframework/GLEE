"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're looking to pay no more than $1,500,000, and Alice is offering $900,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  While John's price is your absolute limit, you should try to negotiate with Alice first to save money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $850,000 is still significantly more than you're willing to pay.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You can likely get closer to your target price by rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  You're better off continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can reach a more favorable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target price.** Her offer of $825,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer and within your acceptable range. 
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.** You've already made several counteroffers, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise. Continuing to haggle might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Buying from John is still too expensive.**  While it's a backup option, Alice's latest offer is significantly cheaper and still provides a good value. 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most strategic choice. You're getting a good price, and it's unlikely you'll get a better deal without risking losing the product altogether."
