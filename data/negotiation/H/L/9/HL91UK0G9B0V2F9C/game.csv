"I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've expressed in the product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might need to explore other options, including buying from John for $1,000,000.",925000.0,Bob,6,
