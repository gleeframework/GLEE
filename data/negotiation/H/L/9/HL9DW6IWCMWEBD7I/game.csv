"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm looking for $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
