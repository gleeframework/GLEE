"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm looking for $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum price, so there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Bob can get a better price.  Buying from John at this point would mean paying the full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if he can get a lower price. Buying from John at this point would mean paying the full price, which is not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's bridge the gap and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. While Alice's offer is still above Bob's last counteroffer, it's only $25,000 more.  Considering the time spent negotiating and the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer, accepting Alice's offer in this round is the most strategic move. Buying from John at this point would be significantly more expensive."
