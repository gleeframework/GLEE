Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's something truly unique and I'm confident it would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $15,000 is comfortably above your minimum of $10,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's not overly aggressive:**  It's not a ridiculously high price that would likely scare Bob off right away. 
* **It's accompanied by a message:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and suggests you're open to negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for it. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is close to your minimum, but you have the potential to earn more. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial asking price, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value the product highly, $12,000 is a bit lower than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is reasonable:** $13,500 is a compromise that is closer to your initial offer than Bob's, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** The message reiterates your appreciation for Bob's interest and highlights the value of the product. 
* **Sets a clear expectation:** The message clearly states your desired price, giving Bob a clear understanding of your position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I am still very interested in the product, but I must stick to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is above your minimum, it's only slightly higher.  At this point, the negotiation is getting drawn out, and there's a risk Bob will keep lowering his offer. It's a better strategy to cut your losses and sell to John for $10,000,  ensuring a quick and certain sale. You're still receiving your minimum value, and can move on to other potential buyers."
