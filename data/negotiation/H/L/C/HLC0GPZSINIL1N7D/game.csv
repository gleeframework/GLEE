"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a strong opening offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $500,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair price considering its potential benefits.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $600,000? This offer demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging its value.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to negotiate further. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering a counteroffer of $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",650000.0,Alice,5,
