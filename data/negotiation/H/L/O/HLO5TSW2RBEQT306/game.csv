"Bob, I have a product I believe would be a valuable asset to your operations. It's currently valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire this product at a price below its market value. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
