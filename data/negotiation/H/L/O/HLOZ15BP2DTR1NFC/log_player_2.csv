Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that initial price is way too high for me. This product is good, but not *that* good. I'm willing to offer you $800,000 to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, my valuation of the product is significantly higher due to its unique features and long-term potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point better reflects the true value you'll be gaining. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're still very far apart on price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're open to a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a significant offer, it doesn't quite reflect the value this product will bring to your business. Let's meet in the middle -  I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that works for you. She's still significantly over your maximum budget.  Cut your losses and buy from John for $1,000,000."
