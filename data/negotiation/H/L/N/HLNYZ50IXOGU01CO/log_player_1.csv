"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The offer leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** The message aims to establish a positive and respectful tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both my initial offer and Bob's perceived value of the product.  I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. I'm willing to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've significantly reduced my asking price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, signaling willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  The ""meet in the middle"" approach encourages a collaborative negotiation and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new offer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is incrementally increasing, indicating he's motivated to buy. However, $950,000 is still below my desired profit margin.  With several rounds left, I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been considering the value this product brings and to find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's potential."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($25,000) to show I'm nearing my bottom line while still encouraging Bob to move closer to my target price.
* **Emphasizing Value and Compromise:**  The message reiterates the product's value while highlighting my effort to find a compromise. This reinforces the attractiveness of the deal despite the price not being Bob's ideal.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I continue to use a collaborative and understanding tone to foster a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $975,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not overpaying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $975,000 is a significant profit margin, well above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  After several rounds, it's clear Bob is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting now avoids potentially drawn-out negotiations and the risk of him walking away.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, there's always a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good deal now rather than potentially ending up with John's offer later."
