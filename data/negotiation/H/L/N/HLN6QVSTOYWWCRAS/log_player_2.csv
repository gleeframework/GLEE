"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still a significant amount above the product's value to Alice ($8,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above the product's value to Alice. This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  Bob is hoping to find a price that is closer to the product's value to Alice, but still within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and there is still room for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows that he is willing to negotiate, but still wants a price closer to Alice's minimum.  $10,500 is a good compromise point, and Bob is hoping Alice will accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, even though it is slightly lower than her previous offer. Bob is still willing to negotiate and try to reach a price closer to his budget. There are still several rounds remaining, and Bob has time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his counteroffer, but only slightly. He is demonstrating that he is serious about purchasing the product and is willing to meet Alice halfway. This offer also keeps the price within Bob's budget and shows that he is still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still too high for him to accept. There are only three rounds left, and Bob still has time to try and negotiate a lower price. If he rejects the offer, he can make a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's minimum price, and potentially get a better deal. It is still worthwhile to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, Bob needs to be more aggressive.  He's increased his offer to $12,000, which is still within his budget but also significantly closer to Alice's last offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to meet her halfway. Bob is hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as it is a good compromise for both parties.  If Alice rejects, Bob will be forced to make a decision in the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final round with Alice. Alice's offer of $14,500 is still too high for Bob, even though it's slightly lower than her previous offer.  With only one round left, the likelihood of Alice accepting a counteroffer at a price that satisfies Bob is low. Additionally, Alice's previous rejections show that she's not willing to budge much. It's now more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $15,000, which is his maximum budget. This decision ensures he gets the product while staying within his financial limits."
