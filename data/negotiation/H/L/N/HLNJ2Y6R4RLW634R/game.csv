"I understand that $180 might be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $150. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm sure we can find a happy medium.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $145. It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $135. It's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product. Let's close the deal.",135.0,Bob,6,
