Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while considering your budget."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is moving closer to our desired price range. Accepting $1,300,000 now would leave potential profit on the table. We'll counter-offer to nudge him closer to $1,400,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. How about we settle on $1,375,000? This seems like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product will bring you."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,325,000. I believe this price is a good balance between the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we're getting close to a price that represents a good profit. Accepting $1,325,000 at this point avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiations stalling out. While we could push for a slightly higher price, securing a deal now at this level is a reasonable outcome."
