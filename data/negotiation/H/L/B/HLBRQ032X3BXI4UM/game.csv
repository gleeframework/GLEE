,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
