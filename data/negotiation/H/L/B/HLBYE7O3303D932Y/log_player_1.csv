Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $8,500 is too low for me, and I think I can do better with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I can't go all the way down to $8,500, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is still a great price for a product worth much more, and it leaves some room for us both to be happy.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500, which would be $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is still too far below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can push him closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9,000 is still below my bottom line.  Let's split the difference again - I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,250.  This is a fair price, and I think it's a good opportunity for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,125 is closer to my target price, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I have a few rounds left, so I'm going to try to push for a higher price."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  We're getting close with Bob, but it's clear that we're not going to be able to agree on a price that works for both of us.  I've only got two rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John."
