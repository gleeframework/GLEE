"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I can't go all the way down to $8,500, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is still a great price for a product worth much more, and it leaves some room for us both to be happy.  Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500, which would be $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9,000 is still below my bottom line.  Let's split the difference again - I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,250.  This is a fair price, and I think it's a good opportunity for you. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be flexible, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, which would be $9,125. Can you consider that?",9125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,125, but I'm still holding out for $9,200.  It's only a small difference, but it's important to me.  Let's close this deal and be done with it. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your desire to get to $9,200, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, which would be $9,150. Can you consider that?",9150.0,Bob,8,
