# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your desire for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?

Alice is coming closer to my desired price, but I still think there's a bit more room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to hers and see how she responds."

# Alice's message: I understand that $675,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $725,000.

This is a good price, and it seems like Alice is firm on her final offer. It's better to accept this deal than to risk pushing her away and having to pay the full price to John."
