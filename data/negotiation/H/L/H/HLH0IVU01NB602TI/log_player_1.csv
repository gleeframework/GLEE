"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident that Bob will find the value in this product, and hopefully, we can reach a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise that is still above Bob's offer, but it shows that I am willing to negotiate. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the value of the product and gives Bob a good deal while still ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm going to counter with $940,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer but shows I'm still willing to negotiate. It's a midpoint between our last two offers and hopefully, we can finally find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm concerned that we are running out of time and the negotiations are stalling. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum acceptable value. John's offer is a guaranteed deal that meets my financial needs, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
