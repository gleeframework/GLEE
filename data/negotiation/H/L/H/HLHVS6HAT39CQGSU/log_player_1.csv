Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
