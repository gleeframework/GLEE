"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which is worth a significant amount to me, for a price that I believe is fair and competitive. I'm asking for $950000. This is a chance to acquire something truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  However, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to continue with this negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $900000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $880000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my offer?",880000.0,Bob,4,
