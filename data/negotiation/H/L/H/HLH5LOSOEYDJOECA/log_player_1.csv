Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which is worth a significant amount to me, for a price that I believe is fair and competitive. I'm asking for $950,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product without revealing my exact minimum. 
* **Open-ended Question:** I encourage Bob to engage and provide his perspective. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counter-proposal or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** I'll make a counter-offer, but I'll need to be careful not to push Bob away entirely.

I'll aim for a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price point, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  However, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to continue with this negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** Show that I'm taking his offer seriously and not dismissing it out of hand.
* **Counter-Offer with Justification:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to my desired price but still a compromise from my previous offer. I'm justifying it as a ""middle ground"" to make it seem more reasonable.
* **Maintain Open Communication:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to keep the negotiation moving forward.

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain Interest:**  Show Bob I'm still interested in doing business with him.
* **Show Flexibility:**  Demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Increase the Price:**  Hopefully, this counter-offer will bring us closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $900000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $880000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price of $800,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's a good chance he'll walk away, and I might end up selling to John for a lower price.
* **Time & Effort:**  Further negotiation might take more time and effort without guaranteeing a significantly higher price.

At this point, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision to maximize my earnings while minimizing risk."
