"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which reflects its exceptional worth. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for this product. It's significantly less than its true market value.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $900,000. I think that's a more reasonable price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still below the value I've placed on this product. How about $950,000? This would be a fair compromise that reflects the unique qualities and potential of this opportunity.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from this product. Can you consider that?",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $920,000 is still a little below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $935,000. This offer takes into account both our needs and is a fair reflection of the product's worth.",935000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $935,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $930,000, but no higher. I think that's the best we can do without going over my budget. Can you consider that?",930000.0,Bob,8,
