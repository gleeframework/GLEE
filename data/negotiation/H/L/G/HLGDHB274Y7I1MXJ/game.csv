"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm initially offering it to you for $2,250,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the potential return on investment you'll see.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I do believe this product would be valuable, but the price point you've presented is a bit high for my budget. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? This reflects a more reasonable investment on my end while still acknowledging the product's potential.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation while still leaving room for a profitable partnership.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find a middle ground here. While I appreciate you moving on the price, it's still a larger leap than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,525,000?  This shows I'm serious while acknowledging the value this product holds.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
