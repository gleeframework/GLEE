"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,750 just isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,900, which is a fair compromise. This would allow us to both get a good deal.  What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
