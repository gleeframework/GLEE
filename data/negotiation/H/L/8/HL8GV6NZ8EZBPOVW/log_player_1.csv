Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss it further."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while still ensuring we get a price higher than John's offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down a bit, while still remaining above our guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message aims to convey value and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
