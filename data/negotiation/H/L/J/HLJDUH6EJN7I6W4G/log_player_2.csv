"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great opportunity to acquire something that will benefit you significantly. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to her. While $9,500 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting her offer. You can then try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy it from John for $10,000."
