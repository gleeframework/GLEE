{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By starting at $13,000, I have room to lower the price if Bob counters.
* **John as a backup:**  The fact that I have John as a backup at $10,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to walk away from the negotiation if the price drops too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $11,000 is better than $10,000, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **John as a safety net:** If negotiation fails, I still have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize the value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob by reminding him it's a ""great deal"".
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not dropping to Bob's initial offer, I maintain some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, potentially pushing me below my minimum.
* **John's offer as a fallback:** I can always sell to John for $10,000 if this negotiation falls through.  It's better to secure $11,500 now and minimize the risk of a lower price."
