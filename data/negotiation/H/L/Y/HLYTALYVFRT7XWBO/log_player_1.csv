Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit and $12,000 is a good starting point.
* **It's lower than Bob's valuation:** Bob has a clear incentive to accept, as he'll still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you have room to adjust the price further. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product is worth $8,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than $8,000 from John, I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob.  He clearly wants the product, and I have room to negotiate closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between our last two offers. This keeps the negotiation moving while also staying within my desired price range.  Let's see if he's willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,000. Can we meet in the middle one more time? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would love to keep negotiating, Bob has come up to a price point that is very close to my desired outcome. Accepting his offer of $10,000 secures a good profit for me and closes the deal. It's important to recognize when a good deal is on the table and not risk losing it by pushing for too much."
