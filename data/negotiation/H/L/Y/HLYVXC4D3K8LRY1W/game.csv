"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value this product highly, I'm open to negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $1,250,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
