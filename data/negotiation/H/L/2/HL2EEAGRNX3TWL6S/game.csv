"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it a great deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,400,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,400,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,550,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
