{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value, giving him some wiggle room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit greater than my minimum acceptable price. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me. How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is my final offer. If we can agree on this, we can both be happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
