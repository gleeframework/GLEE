{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but considering the number of rounds remaining, I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,630,000. It's not the ideal price, but it's a significant profit for me and it's the best I'm likely to get from Bob at this point.  I'd risk losing a sale altogether if I continue to push for a higher price."
