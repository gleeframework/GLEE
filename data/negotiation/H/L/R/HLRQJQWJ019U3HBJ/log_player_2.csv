"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worthwhile to try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to get a deal done, especially since you're clearly interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above my budget. While it's closer to my ideal price, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I can secure the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget and guarantees the purchase."
