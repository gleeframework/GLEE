"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, or potentially sell to John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counter-offering at $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still being within my acceptable range. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next rounds. I'm also aware that I can sell the product to John for $80 at any moment, so I'm not under immediate pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is just $5 below my minimum acceptable price. This is a strong signal that I'm willing to negotiate but I also want to be fairly compensated for the product.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and finally agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. It's also the same price I could get from John. Although I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and I risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price. It's best to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
