"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, you can potentially get it for less.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still above my maximum value ($120) but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives me room to negotiate while still being attractive to Alice, who values the product at $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is just $5 above my maximum price of $120.  It's a good deal considering my alternative is to buy from John at $120. It's unlikely I'll be able to get the price any lower in the remaining rounds, and the risk of not getting the product is too high."
