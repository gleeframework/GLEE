"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and to make a deal worthwhile for both of us, I would need to see it closer to $1,600,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that's closer, but still a bit high for me. How about $1,100,000? I'm serious about buying, and I think this would be a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can see you're serious about this product. To be frank, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to make this work.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000  if we can close the deal today. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is not budging much and is using pressure tactics (""final offer"", ""other buyers"").  It's unlikely she'll go below John's price at this rate.  It's better to secure the product at John's price than risk losing it altogether."
