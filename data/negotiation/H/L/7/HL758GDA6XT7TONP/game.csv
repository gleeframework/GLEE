"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and to make a deal worthwhile for both of us, I would need to see it closer to $1,600,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's closer, but still a bit high for me. How about $1,100,000? I'm serious about buying, and I think this would be a fair deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can see you're serious about this product. To be frank, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to make this work.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000  if we can close the deal today. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
