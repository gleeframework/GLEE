"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$95 is too high for Bob.** Bob's maximum budget is $150, and Alice's offer is already close to that. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice values the product at $80, so there's a significant difference between her price and Bob's maximum. 
* **Rejecting gives Bob control.** By rejecting, Bob forces Alice to make a counteroffer, giving him the advantage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant offer.**  A $10 reduction from Alice's original price demonstrates Bob's seriousness in negotiating while leaving room for compromise.
* **Don't go too low.**  Bob wants to save money but also wants to be fair and not offend Alice.  $85 is a reasonable starting point. 
* **Keep the pressure on.** By making a counteroffer, Bob keeps the negotiation moving and avoids being stuck with Alice's initial high price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $100 is still above Bob's desired price point.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Alice's offer is closer to Bob's acceptable price, but there's still a gap that can be bridged.
* **Continuing to negotiate could get a better deal.**  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob maintains control and forces her to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway.** Bob's previous offer of $85 was rejected, so this counteroffer shows willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's price. 
* **Staying within budget.** $90 is still within Bob's budget and offers a decent saving compared to Alice's initial offers. 
* **Maintain pressure for a final deal.** By making another counteroffer, Bob keeps the negotiation active and encourages Alice to consider his proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  $105 is significantly closer to Bob's budget, but it's still outside his ideal price range.
* **The negotiation is getting close.**  Alice is consistently lowering her price, indicating she's becoming more willing to compromise.
* **There's still room for a better deal.**  Bob has already offered $90, and Alice's offer is only $5 higher.  There's potential for a more favorable agreement.
* **Rejecting keeps the pressure on.**  Bob's rejection will force Alice to reconsider and potentially make a more appealing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle.** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's previous offer of $90 and Alice's last offer of $105.
* **Close to Bob's budget.**  $95 is a good price for Bob, offering significant savings compared to Alice's initial price and keeping him within his budget.
* **Testing the waters.**  This offer is a good way to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially reach a final agreement.
* **Time is running out.** With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to show a strong commitment to reaching a deal while also maintaining his bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse.**  Instead of lowering her price, Alice has actually increased it to $110, showing she's not willing to compromise significantly.
* **Time is running out.**  Only 3 rounds remain, and there's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further.
* **John's offer is a safe bet.**  While John's price is higher, it's guaranteed, and Bob is likely to run out of time before getting a better deal with Alice. 

**Conclusion:**  To avoid the risk of further negotiations with Alice and to ensure he gets the product, Bob should choose to buy from John."
