"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000 is too high for Bob, as he is willing to pay a maximum of $15,000.
* **John's price:**  $15,000 is Bob's absolute maximum, but he can still try to negotiate with Alice.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can start the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money. 
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* **Counteroffer:** $13,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant discount from Alice's offer but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.

This counteroffer signals Bob's interest while demonstrating his willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $13,000 is a little low for me, but I'm flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than Alice's initial offer but higher than Bob's counteroffer, finding a middle ground.
* **John's price:**  $15,000 is still higher than Alice's current offer.

Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product for a price lower than John's, achieving his goal of saving money."
