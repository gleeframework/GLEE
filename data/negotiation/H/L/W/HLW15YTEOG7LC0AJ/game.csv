"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,100,000 is a little high. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
