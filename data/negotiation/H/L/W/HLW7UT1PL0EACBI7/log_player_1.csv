Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $95 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $95 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $80, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not demanding, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $80 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $85 is closer to my minimum of $80, I can potentially still get a better price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  He's already shown interest, and my initial offer was quite high.
* **Minimizing Losses:**  While selling to John is a secure option, I'd rather try to get a little closer to the $95 I initially proposed. 

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $90?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, lowering my price but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and open tone, keeping the conversation productive.
* **Fair Price:** I believe $90 is a fair price considering the value to Bob and my own minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:** I remind Bob that this is still a ""good deal,"" emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $87.50? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $87.50 is very close to my minimum of $80. 
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation could drag on, and there's no guarantee I'd get a better price. 
* **Time Factor:**  It's possible that John might not be available indefinitely.  Accepting this offer avoids the risk of losing both buyers. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $87.50 is a solid deal and minimizes the risk of losing out on any sale."
