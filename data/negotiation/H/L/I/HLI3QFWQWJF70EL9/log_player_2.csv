# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you won't regret it.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let go of this product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about we settle on $1350000? It's a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let me know your thoughts.
