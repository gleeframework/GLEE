"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer is as much about understanding Bob's eagerness as it is about getting my ideal price. His response will give me valuable information for the rest of the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $800,000, which gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value of the product.  Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about obtaining a price closer to its true worth.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly under the product's value to both of us.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer  demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer, signaling flexibility, but remains firmly above Bob's first offer. 
* **Time Constraint:** As we only have 10 rounds, I need to balance pushing for a high price with the risk of running out of time. This offer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming high. 
* **Backup Plan:** My safety net of John's offer allows me to be firm in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $650,000. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob's offer increased, but it's still a small jump.  This suggests there's more room for negotiation, and accepting now would likely leave money on the table.
* **Time Factor:** While we are nearing the halfway point,  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds.  The potential gain from a significantly higher price outweighs the risk of Bob walking away at this stage.
* **Alternative Option:** The existence of John's offer gives me a safety net and allows me to continue pushing for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we both see the value here. How about we bridge the gap significantly? I'm willing to come down to $850,000 if you're ready to finalize the deal."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** I'm making a substantial drop in my asking price to signal seriousness and encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial offer.  
* **Urgency:** This offer creates a sense of urgency by implying I'm ready to close the deal if he meets my price.  
* **Profit Margin:** While lower than my initial goal, $850,000 is still a healthy profit margin above my minimum acceptable price.
* **John as Leverage:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup, but I believe this offer is attractive enough to entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $700,000?  That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** While Bob's offer has increased, it's clear we're reaching an impasse.  His latest offer is still significantly below my $850,000 counteroffer, indicating a reluctance to move substantially closer to my acceptable range. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only four rounds remaining, the risk of Bob's offers remaining below John's guaranteed $800,000 outweighs the potential of a slightly higher offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John's offer provides a safe and immediate exit strategy, ensuring I achieve my minimum desired profit without further negotiation or risk."
