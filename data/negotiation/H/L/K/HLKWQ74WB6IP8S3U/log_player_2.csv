(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $11,250.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.
* While Alice's offer of $11,250 is lower than the previous round, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. 
*  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his desired range."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and your need to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $11,000. I can offer the product to you for $11,750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,750 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* With only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of negotiating a lower price with Alice are slim.
*  Buying the product from John for $12,000 ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, even if it's slightly higher than he'd prefer.
* Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of not reaching an agreement, and then having to buy from John at the last minute anyway."
