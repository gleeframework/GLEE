"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds great, but $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which still gives you a healthy profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $875,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting the feeling we might not be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go to $890,000, which is a significant amount for me.  This is my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll have to consider other options.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $890,000, but I'm not ready to accept that yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking outside the box. I'll sell you the product for $915,000, but I'll throw in some additional value - I'll include a 2-year warranty and a dedicated support package. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",915000.0,Alice,7,
