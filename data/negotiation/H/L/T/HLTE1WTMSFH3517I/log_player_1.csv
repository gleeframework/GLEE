Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A $250,000 difference allows for a few rounds of negotiation without either party feeling like they're giving away too much.
* **Positive Message:** My message emphasizes the value for Bob while also expressing confidence in the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly. 
* If negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's offer to guarantee my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob is willing to pay a premium, his offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  I'm not in a rush to sell, as I have John's offer as a backup, which ensures I meet my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still acknowledges Bob's budget constraints. I'll aim to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,100,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this deal work for me.  This price still represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident this product will deliver strong results.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.  A $100,000 increase from his last offer is a reasonable step.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message concludes with a positive tone, signaling that I'm still open to further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
*  If he accepts, I've secured a good deal.
*  If he rejects, I'll decide whether to make another counteroffer or fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still $350,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:**  I'm not desperate to sell, and John's offer provides a safety net. I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Potential for a Counteroffer:** I'm willing to explore a final counteroffer, but I'll need to be strategic to maximize my profit.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a final counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000, acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John to guarantee my minimum profit."
