Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5

# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I can do $115, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good price, I still have a few rounds left and am hoping to get it down to $110.  The offer from John is still an option if I can't get a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and while I'd prefer a lower price, $118 is still a good deal compared to John's price of $120. There are only a few rounds left, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
