"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get a product worth $10,000 to you for a lower price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of getting a better deal, either from Alice countering with a lower price or by sticking with your option to buy from John."
