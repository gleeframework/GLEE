"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer and recognize the value of this product. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for it. This represents a significant saving for you compared to selling it to John, and it would be a great deal for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
