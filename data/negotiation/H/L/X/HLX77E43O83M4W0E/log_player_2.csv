"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice's offer is exactly $1,200,000, there's no room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to explore other options, potentially finding a better price.  Buying from John at the same price offers no advantage."
