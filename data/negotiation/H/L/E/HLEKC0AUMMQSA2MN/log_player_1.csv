Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a bold move, but I believe it's a good starting point.  It gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, but also establishes a high value for the product in Bob's mind. 

I'll be watching closely to see how Bob reacts. If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own.  I'm prepared to be flexible, but I won't settle for less than $1,500,000.  If things stall, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy Bob is willing to pay my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if I can get closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to earn a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $1,500,000 and not too far off my last offer. I'd rather accept his offer than risk further negotiation and possibly ending up with John's offer."
