"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's within his budget while still leaving some room for negotiation. Offering $120 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $130, which is within Bob's budget of $150.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product while still saving $20 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might yield a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and the deal falling through entirely."
