"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we bring the price down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, my budget ceiling is $950,000. If you're able to come down to that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your transparency, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.",975000.0,Alice,5,
