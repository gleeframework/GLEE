"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I'm willing to lower the price to $13,800. This is a compromise that takes into account your concerns and my needs. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13800.0,Alice,3,
