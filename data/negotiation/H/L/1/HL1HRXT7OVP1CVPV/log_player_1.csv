"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what I know it's worth to Bob, but still above my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a $150 budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, but it's a good sign that he's interested. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $135? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, could we agree on $132 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $132 is just above my minimum price of $120, and I've already rejected his offer twice.  It's likely that if I reject this offer, he will either go down further, or I'll end up selling to John for $120.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
