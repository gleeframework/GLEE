"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your offer, I'm unable to go that low at this time.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects a significant price reduction from my initial offer and keeps the deal profitable for me.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to come down to $1750000, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'd be willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
