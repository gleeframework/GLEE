"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good starting point for negotiation.  Since I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, I'm leaving some room to potentially come down in price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is more than my minimum, it's still lower than my initial offer and leaves room for me to potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $18,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $17,000. This is a good deal for me, as it's significantly higher than my minimum of $15,000.  While I could potentially push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal to John or further rounds of negotiation is not worth it."
