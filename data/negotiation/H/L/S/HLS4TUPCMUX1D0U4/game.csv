"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I think $9,250 is closer to a fair price, I'm aiming for something a little lower. Would you be willing to do $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  Let's make this our final exchange to save us both some time.  How about $8,800?  If that works, we have a deal.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer.  While I value our time, I'm aiming for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,7,
