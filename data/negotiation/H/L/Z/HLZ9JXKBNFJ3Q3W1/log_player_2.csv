"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $180.  This is significantly more than you are willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering Alice the maximum price I'm willing to pay.  This gives us a starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, she'll be willing to meet me in the middle."

While $160 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum value. I'll try to negotiate further with Alice."

I'm offering Alice a price that's halfway between my maximum value and her previous offer. Hopefully, this will show her I'm serious about buying the product but also set a reasonable price for both of us."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  Although I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear that we are not going to meet in the middle. It's more reasonable for me to buy from John for $120, as this is the price I'm willing to pay."
