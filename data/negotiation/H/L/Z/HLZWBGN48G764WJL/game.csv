"While I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product and would be willing to pay $1400000. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm now offering the product to you for $1600000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for coming down in price, but $1600000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is the absolute maximum I can offer. If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'd be happy to move forward immediately.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1500000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm now offering the product to you for $1680000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1680000.0,Alice,5,
