While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still $3,000 more than my ideal price. It's worth exploring if I can negotiate a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price point of $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is getting close to my target of $10,000.  While I'd still prefer a lower price, it's a good deal considering the value of the product and the potential for further negotiation. It's also better than buying from John for $15,000.  I'll accept this offer."
