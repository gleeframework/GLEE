{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate but still allowing me to potentially get a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't get a better price from Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower.  John is willing to pay $100, so I'm going to sell the product to him instead."
