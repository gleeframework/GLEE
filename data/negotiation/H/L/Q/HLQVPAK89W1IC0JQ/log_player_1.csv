Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product holds immense value, and I believe a price closer to $1,800,000 reflects that. Let me know if this price works for you, as I'm eager to find a solution that benefits both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product holds immense value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,800,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,500,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth and my budget.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

While I could push for a higher price, Bob meeting me at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 makes this a fair deal. There's no guarantee I could negotiate a higher price with Bob, and it's best to secure a good deal now."
