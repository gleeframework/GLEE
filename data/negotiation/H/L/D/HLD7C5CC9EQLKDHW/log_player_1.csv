"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough to potentially get a good price, but it's also lower than my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects, I can always make a counteroffer or go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I could accept and get some money, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference closer to your last offer, say $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though he's moving closer.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
