Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $10,800. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Alice is still unwilling to come down to my desired price range.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  While I would have preferred a slightly lower price, saving $2,200 is a good deal."
