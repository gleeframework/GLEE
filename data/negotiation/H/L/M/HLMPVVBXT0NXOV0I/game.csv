"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 right now.  Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $10,800. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,800 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to split the difference and offer $9,650. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's get this deal done!",9650.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,800 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $10,200? This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
