Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $11,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's not overly aggressive, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion, inviting Bob to counteroffer if needed. 
* **Plan B:**  Keeping John as a backup option provides leverage in case Bob becomes too difficult to negotiate with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I believe it's worth less than what you're asking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a loss.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me. I can aim for a price closer to my desired $10,000 or at least something higher than $8,000. 
* **John as leverage:**  Knowing that I have John as a backup buyer gives me more negotiating power. I can use this leverage to push for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** The counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a drastic loss. $9,500 is a reasonable compromise that's closer to my desired price and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly and professional tone, emphasizing a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Leveraging John:**  While not explicitly mentioned, my knowledge of John's offer gives me leverage to be more assertive in the negotiation. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I'm prepared to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to accept a slight loss to secure the sale.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower offer from Bob or even a stalemate.  Accepting his offer brings the negotiation to a close.
* **Time factor:**  Selling to Bob for $9,000 is a quicker and more certain outcome than risking further negotiation or waiting to see if John is still interested."
