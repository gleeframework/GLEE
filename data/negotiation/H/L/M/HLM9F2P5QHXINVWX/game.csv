"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $95 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal considering the value of the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
