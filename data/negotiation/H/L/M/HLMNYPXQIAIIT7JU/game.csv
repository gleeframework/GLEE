"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $1150000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I need to make a profit, and $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we compromise at $1100000 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but that's as low as I can go. Can we make a deal at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the price I'd be willing to sell it to John for. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000 one last time, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we compromise at $1075000?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
