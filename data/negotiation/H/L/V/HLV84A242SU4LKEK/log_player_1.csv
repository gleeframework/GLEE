Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he counters.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While we want to maximize profit, offering it too close to $10,000 might make Bob walk away.  $9,500 is a price that's significantly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves us room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Encouraging a Deal:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" and the product's value to Bob, hopefully encouraging him to accept. 
 
**Important Note:**  We don't want to go too low initially.  We have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's no need to undervalue the product."
