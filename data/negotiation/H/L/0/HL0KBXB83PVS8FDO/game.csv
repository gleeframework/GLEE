"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a significant discount from the original price, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'm going to counter with $1025000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counter with $1075000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $980000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer.",980000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle, but I'm still willing to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than $1075000. I'm going to make one more offer, and it's going to be a take-it-or-leave-it situation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000, but if you don't accept, I'll be forced to sell it to someone else. The offer is on the table, and I'm waiting for your response.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
