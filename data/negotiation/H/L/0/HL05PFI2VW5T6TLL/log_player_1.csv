Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1200000 is significantly beyond my budget.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant reduction from the original price, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for this product.
