"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer in its industry, and I think you'll be impressed by its features and benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is significantly beyond my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing but would need to see a lower price point.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, as a starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my seriousness about buying while also pushing for a better deal.
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for my counteroffer (budget limitations) to make it seem reasonable.
* **Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiations, allowing us to find a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant reduction from the original price, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my maximum budget.  While I'd prefer to pay less, it's a fair price considering my limited time and the risk of another seller (John) offering the same price.  Accepting this offer secures the product without exceeding my financial limit."
