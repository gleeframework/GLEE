"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price.  While $9,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, which would be $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiation, and I see that we're getting closer to a potential deal. However, $10,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
