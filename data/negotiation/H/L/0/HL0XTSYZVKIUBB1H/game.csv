"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can make this work.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go to $115. This is the highest I can go at this point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $115 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $125? This would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $125.  My final offer is $120. This is my absolute limit. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal.  If not, I'll have to go with another seller.",120.0,Bob,6,
