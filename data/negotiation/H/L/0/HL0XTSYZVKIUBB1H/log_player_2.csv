{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see how flexible Alice is.  $100 is a good starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my budget, but I'm open to further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but closer to my $120 limit. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go to $115. This is the highest I can go at this point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise.  $115 is still within my budget and leaves room for a possible final agreement. I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to see if Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $115 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $125? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is tempting, it is still above my maximum budget of $120. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price in the next round, and if unsuccessful, I'm prepared to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $125.  My final offer is $120. This is my absolute limit. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal.  If not, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer, and I'm emphasizing that I'm at my limit.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer to avoid losing the sale to John. I'm also reminding her of the alternative, putting pressure on her to make a deal."
