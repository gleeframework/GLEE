**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for you, especially considering you can get the product from John for $1,000,000. While further negotiation is possible, it's likely that Alice won't go much lower. Accepting her offer saves you time and effort, and you still get a decent price."
