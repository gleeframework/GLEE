Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him a potential incentive to accept.  By leaving room for negotiation, I increase the chance of a successful deal while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a price so far below the product's worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.  I believe this is a fair offer that gives Bob a reasonable price while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and the potential profit is still significant.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob will walk away and I'll be forced to sell to John at a much lower price. To avoid this, I'll accept Bob's offer."
