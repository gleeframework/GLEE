"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm starting with an offer of $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product is not worth $20000 to me. I am willing to pay up to $15000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. While I would prefer to get more,  accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, and selling to John would result in the same amount."
