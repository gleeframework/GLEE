Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the asking price."", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $15,000, there's space for Bob to counteroffer, and for you to potentially still land above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Emphasizing the product's value might make Bob more willing to consider a higher price, even if he initially intended to spend less. 
 
**Important Note:**  Keep in mind John's standing offer of $12,000.  If the negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, don't hesitate to walk away and take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is above his perceived value of the product ($8,000), indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $9,000 would be a $3,000 loss compared to selling to John. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  By countering, you can try to meet somewhere in the middle and still get a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you do $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This counteroffer is closer to the middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  Importantly, it keeps the price above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (which you can get from John).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While close to your minimum, it leaves a little bit of room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to keep costs down. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is better, but still below your minimum acceptable price from John ($12,000).
* **Signal Your Limit:** By rejecting this offer, you are clearly signaling to Bob that you're not willing to go much lower.
* **John as Leverage:** Remember, you have John's offer as a fallback. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $12,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  I have another buyer at that price, but I'd rather make this deal with you if possible."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message positions your counteroffer as your final price.
* **Transparency and Leverage:** By mentioning the other buyer (John), you add credibility to your claim that this is your lowest price.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** Despite the firm stance, you're still expressing a desire to work with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:** 

* Bob might be willing to meet your price knowing it's the lowest you'll go.
* If Bob rejects this offer, it's likely time to walk away and sell to John for $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate might not be productive."
