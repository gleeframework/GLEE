"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. I believe this product will truly benefit you, and this adjusted price reflects its value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is a fair price. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Can you meet me at a price that's closer to what I'm willing to pay?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but my lowest price for this product is $8,000. That's already a very fair offer considering the value it brings.  Take it or leave it.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"I've thought about it, and I'm still not willing to pay $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $7,500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,6,
