"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully pushes Bob to reveal how much he values the product. I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,500,000, so I'm comfortable with this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still push for a higher price. It's clear Bob values the product, and I want to see if I can close the deal closer to my initial $2,000,000 asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good deal for me.  I believe Bob is motivated to buy the product and will likely accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, we're already on round 4. This is a good deal, and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob."
