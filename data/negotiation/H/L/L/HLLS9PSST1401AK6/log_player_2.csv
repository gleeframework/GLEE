Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,700,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential this product holds.

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above my budget.  Rejecting and counteroffering is the best course of action to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,400,000. This is a firm offer, as I have another interested buyer.  Please let me know your decision.

Alice's offer is still above my budget. I'm not willing to risk another counteroffer, especially since Alice mentioned another buyer.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the safest option and ensures I stay within my budget."
