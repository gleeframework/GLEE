"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to match this price again.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to go to $13,000. If you're willing to consider that, I'm ready to finalize the purchase. ",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $14,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14500.0,Alice,5,
