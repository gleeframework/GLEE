"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great deal for you! I'm willing to sell this amazing product to you for $100. It's a fantastic opportunity to get a great value for your money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $100 is lower than John's price of $120.
* **You still get a good deal:** While $100 is more than the product is worth to Alice ($80), it's within your budget of $120 and saves you $20 compared to John's price."
