"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering its value and quality.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested, but $9500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to go down to $8500?  I'm really interested in this product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9500 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and quality. I'm confident you'll love it!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I'm still interested, $9000 is still a little too high for me.  Would you consider $8750?  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8750 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $8600. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and quality. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon.",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down further. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $8600 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8300.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",8300.0,Bob,6,
