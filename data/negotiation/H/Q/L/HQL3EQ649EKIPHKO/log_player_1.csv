Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and a great price considering the value you'll get out of it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits to Bob (""fantastic opportunity,"" ""great price""). This encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Room to Move:**  I have a lot of room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. If I need to, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get out of the product. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I have room to negotiate further, and potentially get a better price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him. This could lead to a better deal for me than selling to John.
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:** Selling to John at this point would guarantee a profit, but I'm not willing to settle for the lowest possible price just yet. I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $900,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This can signal a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a price higher than Bob's initial offer, but it's significantly lower than my initial offer. This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling pressured.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the value Bob will gain from the product, hoping to sway his decision in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get out of the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, or a stalemate where Bob walks away. 
* **Time is Money:**  Each round of negotiation takes time, and I'm losing out on the potential income from selling to John. 

**Conclusion:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a significant profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely."
