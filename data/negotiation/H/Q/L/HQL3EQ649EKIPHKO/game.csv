"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get out of the product. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $900,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get out of the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
