"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range.  This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not going to overpay.  I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by highlighting my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. It's worth trying to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my $10,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm confident we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm showing flexibility by increasing my offer from $12,000 to $14,000.  This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. By stating that this is my ""absolute limit"", I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and pressure Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $15,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my budget, even with a slight reduction. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as there is still room for a compromise that benefits both of us.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $13,500.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price, offering $13,500. This is still higher than my ideal price of $10,000 but it shows I'm willing to compromise while still staying within a budget I'm comfortable with.  By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness and encourage her to accept a deal closer to my offer."
