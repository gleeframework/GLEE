Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob. I'm being friendly and optimistic to build a positive rapport and encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me. I need to get at least $15,000 for the product.  I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground while still staying above my minimum.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm confident we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $15,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $13,500.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're running out of rounds. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal and ensures I get a reasonable amount for the product."
