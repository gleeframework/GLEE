"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's a number we can work with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob,  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand it's a significant investment, but I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This price still offers a good value for you, and I think we can find common ground here. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in your product, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, $1,100,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise. It's a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,150,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,125,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
