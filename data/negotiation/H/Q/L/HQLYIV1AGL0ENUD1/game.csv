"Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't commit to such a high price. Would you consider selling it for $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than what I need.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,300,000? I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget and the value of the product, I propose we settle on $1,150,000. This price allows us to reach a compromise while staying within my financial limits.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value your continued interest, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,250,000. This offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while ensuring I can still make a worthwhile deal.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. I'd like to continue our negotiation by suggesting a price of $1,200,000. This proposal aims to find a balance between your needs and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't work for me. To be completely transparent, I'm getting close to accepting John's offer of $1,500,000. To avoid that, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and I respect your final offer. However, I am unable to meet $1,350,000. I would like to propose $1,300,000 as my final offer. I hope this brings us closer to closing the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
