Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves him with a potential ""win"" if he negotiates you down slightly.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to make a decision quickly, preventing him from delaying or shopping around. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance, you could adjust your initial offer higher or lower."
