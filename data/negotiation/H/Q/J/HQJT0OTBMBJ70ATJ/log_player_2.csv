"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, potentially exceeding $1000000. I believe this product could be a game-changer for you. While I can't disclose the exact details without a signed NDA, I'm confident it aligns with your business interests.  I'm willing to offer you this product for $1250000.  This is a significant discount from the true value of the product, and I'm sure you'll see the tremendous potential it holds. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While she claims it's a discount, it's still too expensive. It's better to reject the offer and consider John's offer of $1,200,000, which is within your budget."
