"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly sought after. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing our hand.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, we anchor the negotiation at a point favorable to us. Even if Bob counters much lower, the negotiation will likely revolve around a higher number than if we started closer to his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a good offer, we are still early in the negotiation.  Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to go significantly above his initial valuation of $1,000,000. There's room to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession & Anchoring:**  We acknowledge Bob's offer and make a significant concession to show flexibility. However, we anchor our counteroffer close to $2 million, reinforcing the product's high value. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** This framing technique can be psychologically persuasive, even though the ""halfway"" point is subjective.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We keep the negotiation moving forward, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price point above Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to go up to $1,900,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the Limits:** Bob is inching closer to our desired range, but his language (""as high as I can go"") could be a negotiating tactic. We need to test if he has more flexibility.
* **Time Consideration:** We're still relatively early in the negotiation. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob and allows us to explore slightly higher figures.
* **Backup Option:** We have the security of John's offer if the negotiation with Bob stalls or becomes unfavorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I respect your position on this, and I'm trying to find a number that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $1,975,000? That's a significant move on my end."", 
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We acknowledge Bob's movement and make a smaller concession, signaling we're approaching our limit.
* **Odd Number Effect:**  Using $1,975,000 instead of a rounded number creates a sense of precision and might make the offer seem more appealing.
* **Emphasize Value:**  We remind Bob of our concessions and frame the price as a win-win solution.
* **Time Management:** We're at the halfway point and need to start guiding the negotiation towards a close.  This offer encourages Bob to make a decision while still leaving us room to negotiate slightly further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with that price. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,950,000 is a significant amount above Bob's initial valuation and a good return for us. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the capital sooner rather than later.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's offer shows goodwill and may lead to future business opportunities."
