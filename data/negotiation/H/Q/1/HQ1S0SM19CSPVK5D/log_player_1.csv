Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm being polite and open to discussion. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for John:** This offer allows me to sell to John if Bob rejects, but I am still hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below what the product is worth to Bob. Accepting would be a bad deal for me.
* **Opportunity for a better price:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer gives me the chance to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a backup:**  While I'm pursuing a better deal with Bob, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at a price I'm comfortable with.  This allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that even $120 is a good deal for him, as he values the product at $80.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** While I'm offering a compromise, I'm not dropping my price too far below my minimum. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both parties and increases the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and still lower than what the product is worth to Bob. Accepting would be a bad deal for me.
* **Negotiation stalled:**  Bob's offer shows he's not willing to move much closer to my desired price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.  

It's better to cut my losses with Bob and move on to a guaranteed sale with John."
