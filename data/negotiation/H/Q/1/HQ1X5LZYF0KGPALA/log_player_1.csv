{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $145 is a price that:
    * Is significantly more appealing than Bob's perceived value of $120.
    * Leaves me with a profit margin if Bob accepts. 
    * Isn't so high that it would immediately scare Bob away. 

By starting with this offer, I leave room for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price that benefits me."
