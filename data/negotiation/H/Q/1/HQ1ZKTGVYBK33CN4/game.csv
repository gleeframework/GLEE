"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal. Let's see if we can find common ground!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $9000.  If you're willing to meet me halfway, we can close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
