"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is a good price, I'm aiming for more. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price than Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping to reach a compromise quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,600 is a good price, and we're already in round 4. It's likely we won't get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by being too stubborn. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of selling to John for a lower price."
