"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is the absolute maximum I can offer. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I can go up to $12500, which is a fair compromise, and still within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $13000. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. Let's see if we can get to a deal!",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, I can't go any higher than $12750. This is a good compromise for us both, and we can finalize the deal. Let's make it happen!",12750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I think we're really close now! I'm willing to meet you at $13200, which is just a small increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal!",13200.0,Alice,7,
