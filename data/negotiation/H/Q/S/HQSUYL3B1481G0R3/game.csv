"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $105? That seems like a fair compromise.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I'm really close to accepting, Alice, but I need to stick to my budget. Let's meet at $103. This is my final offer.",103.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not going to give up yet, Bob! I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $106, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",106.0,Alice,7,
