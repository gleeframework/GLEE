{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I know John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob, potentially reaching a stalemate or even lower offer.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired value."
