Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $850,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to your desired price. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will become less flexible or you could lose the deal entirely. Accepting this offer saves you $125,000 compared to buying from John and is a good outcome for both parties."
