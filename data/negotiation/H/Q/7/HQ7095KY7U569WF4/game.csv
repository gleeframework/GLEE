"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,500,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,375,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This would still be a significant profit for you, and allows me to meet you halfway.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
