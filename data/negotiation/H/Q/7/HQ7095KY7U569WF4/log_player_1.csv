"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and I'm confident I can get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,500,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,375,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,250,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. Even though we're getting closer, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a better agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This would still be a significant profit for you, and allows me to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems to be very firm on his price, and I've already made several concessions. With only 4 rounds left, the chances of getting a better offer from Bob are slim.  It's time to secure the sale with John for $1,500,000, which meets my minimum acceptable price."
