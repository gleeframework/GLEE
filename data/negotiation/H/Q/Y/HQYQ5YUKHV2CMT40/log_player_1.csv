{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is slightly lower than the value of the product for Bob ($12,000) but higher than what I would be willing to accept from John ($15,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate and gives me a buffer before needing to accept a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).  I am willing to negotiate further with Bob, so I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest! $10,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  Would you consider $12,000?  This is still a good price for you considering the value of the product, and it gets me closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 12000}
