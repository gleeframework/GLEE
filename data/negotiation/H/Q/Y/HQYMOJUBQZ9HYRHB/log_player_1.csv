Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and might lead to a higher profit if Bob is willing to budge. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The initial high price helps understand how interested Bob is. If he outright rejects it, you know he's very price-sensitive. If he counteroffers, you can negotiate.
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, ensuring you won't be stuck with the product.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Listen to his concerns and adjust your price accordingly, keeping your minimum of $12,000 in mind."
