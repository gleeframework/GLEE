"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and try to lower the price further. While John is a backup option at $12,000, it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm interested, I'm only willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $10,500 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer of $11,500, but it's still above Alice's minimum value of $10,000. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still being a better deal for Bob than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would still give you a good deal while ensuring I get a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial price and closer to Bob's desired price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price without risking further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a loss of the deal altogether. Buying from John would be more expensive, making Alice's offer the best option."
