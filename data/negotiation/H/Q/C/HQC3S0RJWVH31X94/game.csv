"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still gives you a good value. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  While I'd love to meet you at $9,000, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  This would still represent a significant saving for you and ensure I'm able to make a fair profit. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $9,250. This is the maximum I can go, and I hope you can consider it. If not, I'll have to reconsider my options",9250.0,Bob,4,
