Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still gives you a good value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you're not selling below your minimum and still have room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This allows Bob to understand the offer quickly and respond accordingly.

It's important to remember that negotiation is a dynamic process, and you'll need to adjust your approach based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum value, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still a $1,000 difference between Bob's offer and your desired price. You may be able to secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Understanding Bob's willingness:** Rejecting the offer shows you're not desperate for a sale and gives you more information about Bob's true budget and willingness to negotiate.

You can use this information to formulate a more strategic counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  While I'd love to meet you at $9,000, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  This would still represent a significant saving for you and ensure I'm able to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $9,250. This is the maximum I can go, and I hope you can consider it. If not, I'll have to reconsider my options 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's strategically sound to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to your minimum:** $9,250 is very close to your minimum value of $12,000.  
* **Limited upside:**  Further negotiation is likely to be very time-consuming, and the potential gains are minimal.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you continue to reject offers, Bob might walk away, forcing you to sell to John for your minimum price.

By accepting, you secure a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing a sale altogether."
