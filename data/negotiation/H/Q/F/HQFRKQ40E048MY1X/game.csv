"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of the product, $1200000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850000 is still below my target. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a price you can live with.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1100000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm at $975000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product for me. Let's reach a deal now.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your determination, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $975000 is still not enough to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make a final compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a price you can live with.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
