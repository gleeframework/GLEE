"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000, a price that I think is a great compromise between what I need to make and what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room to negotiate a better price. By rejecting this offer, you might encourage Alice to propose a lower price closer to her $800,000 valuation. You can always buy from John at $1,500,000 as a last resort."
