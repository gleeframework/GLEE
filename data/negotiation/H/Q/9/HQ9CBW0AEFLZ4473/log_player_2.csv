"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and still allows me to make a significant profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a better deal."
