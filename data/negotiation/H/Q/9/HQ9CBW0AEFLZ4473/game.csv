"Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and still allows me to make a significant profit. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
