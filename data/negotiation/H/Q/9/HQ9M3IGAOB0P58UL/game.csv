"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to pay more than the initial offer. In light of this, I am willing to consider a price closer to your proposal. I am now offering the product at $900,000. This is still a substantial discount from its true value, but I hope it aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to go to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to come away happy.",875000.0,Bob,4,
