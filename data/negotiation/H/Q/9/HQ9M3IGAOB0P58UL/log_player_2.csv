**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate further before committing."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to pay more than the initial offer. In light of this, I am willing to consider a price closer to your proposal. I am now offering the product at $900,000. This is still a substantial discount from its true value, but I hope it aligns better with your expectations.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, which is a good sign.  However, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject her offer and try to push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've reviewed your latest offer and I'm pleased to say that I'm willing to consider it. I am now offering the product at $880,000. This is a fair compromise that respects the value you place on the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my last offer, and we're now only $5,000 apart.  At this point, it's worth accepting her offer.  It's a good price and I'm unlikely to get it much lower. Buying from John would cost me a lot more."
