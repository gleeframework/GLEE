"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,100,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the potential return will be well worth it.  Let me know your thoughts. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay the full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below her valuation, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's no need to pay more than your alternative option."
