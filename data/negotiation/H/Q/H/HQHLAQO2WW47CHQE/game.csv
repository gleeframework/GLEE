"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope you'll consider it!",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my original counteroffer of $850,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original counteroffer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and our previous negotiations. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
