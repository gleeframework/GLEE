"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. While I appreciate the value it holds, I am currently only able to offer $10,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still feel that $13,000 is too high for me. I would like to propose $12,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
