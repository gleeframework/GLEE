I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value, hoping to capture some of the surplus.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,500 is close to my minimum value, I'm not ready to sell at that price yet.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $10,500. This is a good compromise between our initial offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob has finally met my minimum value, and I'm happy to close the deal at $10,000.  It's not ideal, but it's a fair price and I'm confident I won't find a better offer in the time I have."
