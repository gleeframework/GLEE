"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad to hear that you're willing to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle again?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1600000, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it for a moment. Let me propose $1700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the price I was willing to pay for the product from John. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",1650000.0,Bob,6,
