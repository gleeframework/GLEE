"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be of great benefit to you. This price reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer of $850,000 is closer, it's still too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still too high for me. To bridge the gap and come to a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach a final deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm going to be upfront: $875,000 is still too low for me. I understand we're both trying to find a solution that works for us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $890,000. This is a final offer.  If you're not comfortable with this price, then I'll have to explore other options.",890000.0,Alice,5,
