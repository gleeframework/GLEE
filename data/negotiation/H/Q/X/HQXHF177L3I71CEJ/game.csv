"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $115 for it. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than that to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested. $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $105?  That's still a great deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could you do $95? That's the highest I can go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to work with me.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.",100.0,Alice,5,
