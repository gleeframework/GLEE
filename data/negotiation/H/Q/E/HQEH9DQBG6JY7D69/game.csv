"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $950000, which is a $50000 reduction from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you at $825000 just yet. I can offer you a price of $925000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your latest counteroffer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",925000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I understand you're holding firm, but I'm still not comfortable with $925000. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $875000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement with a bit more compromise.",875000.0,Bob,6,,
