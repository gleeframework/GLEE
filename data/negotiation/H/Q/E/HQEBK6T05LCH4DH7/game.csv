"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to you, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit further, however, and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's try to close this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,3,
