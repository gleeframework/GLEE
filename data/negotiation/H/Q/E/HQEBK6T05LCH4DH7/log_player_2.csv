"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a unique opportunity with immense potential. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  My asking price is $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it at $1,400,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer, potentially saving more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit further, however, and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's try to close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good price for me.  Buying from John would cost $1,500,000, so this is a better deal."
