Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $9,500 is more than your minimum of $8,000, giving you some profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $9,500 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, making it attractive to him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate and potentially reach a higher price. 

Keep in mind that this is just the initial offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what you'd like to get for the product.  You have room to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer.  You can try to meet him halfway, but it's important to keep your minimum price in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I can't go as low as $7,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about $8,500? This still gives you a great deal on a product you value highly. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? I'm really interested in the product and think it's worth it, but I need to make sure I can afford it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but accepting Bob's offer is the best decision for now. Here's why:

* **Your Minimum:** Bob's offer is exactly your minimum price. This means you won't be losing money on the deal.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  You've already shown your willingness to compromise. If you reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll come back with a higher price. He might walk away.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and you might end up with the same offer or a lower one. Selling to John right now guarantees you a quick and sure sale.

While you're not getting the price you initially hoped for, it's important to consider the potential risks of further negotiation."
