"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you, Bob! I'm willing to let you have this amazing product for $90. It's a steal at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $90
* **Your Value:** $100
* **John's Offer:** $100

You can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  You should reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
