"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price is still a good value for you and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this offer.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you truly place on it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,225,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It allows you to make a healthy margin and ensures I get a valuable product within my financial constraints. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price I had in mind. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
