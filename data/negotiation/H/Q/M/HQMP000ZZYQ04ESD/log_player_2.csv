"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than what I value the product at. I will try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but your price is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than Alice's ($100) to see how much she's willing to negotiate. This leaves room for me to increase my offer while still potentially getting a price well below my $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down in price, but it's still above my target. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $90 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price close to her value of $80.  This leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think I've gone as low as I can. I can offer the product to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, $85 is a reasonable deal and significantly less than John's offer. It's unlikely I'll get a much better price from Alice at this point."
