"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  $1,200,000 is less than the $1,500,000 you'd pay to John.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though you're paying more than Alice values the product, you're still saving $300,000 compared to buying from John."
