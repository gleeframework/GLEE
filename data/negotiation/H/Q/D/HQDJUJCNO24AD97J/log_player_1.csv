Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing John provides a guaranteed $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but wants a slightly lower price. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100), increasing the chance he'll reject it. 
* **Below John's Offer:**  It's crucial the offer is below John's $150, ensuring you don't lose money if Bob accepts.

This strategy aims to find a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
