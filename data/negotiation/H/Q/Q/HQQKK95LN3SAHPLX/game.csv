"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $20,000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  I believe this product will be very valuable to you, and I'm offering it at a significantly lower price than what it's truly worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  I could consider a price closer to $7,000 if you're open to it.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This is a significant discount from my original offer and reflects my desire to reach a fair deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $7,500. That's a fair offer considering the price I have from another seller.",7500.0,Bob,6,
