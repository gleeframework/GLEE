"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for this product. This is my maximum offer, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
