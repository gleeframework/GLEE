"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am pleased to offer you our exclusive product for $950,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item valued at $1,000,000 by you, at a price that reflects its high quality and rarity. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can likely get a better deal. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and the product is worth less to Alice than it is to you. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is intriguing, but I believe a more agreeable price can be reached.  Given the product's value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, I'd like to offer $850,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing for a significant profit for you while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to meet my valuation, I must respectfully decline your proposal. I am unable to lower the price below $900,000 due to the product's intrinsic value and the costs associated with acquiring it. I hope this price remains within your acceptable range, as I am confident in the product's worth and the opportunity we have to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $900,000, which is significantly closer to your desired price of $850,000.  At this point, it's a gamble:

* **Reject and counteroffer:** You risk Alice walking away or being stubborn, potentially leading to a higher price or even a deadlock.
* **Accept:** You secure the product for a price that's within your budget and leaves some room for profit.

Given the risk involved in further negotiation and the possibility of needing to buy from John at $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
