# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $130. I believe it's a very fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can likely get a better price from Alice, as $130 is still above your maximum budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $125?

You're still closer to your goal of saving money, but $125 is still above your budget.  You should try to get Alice down closer to $115."
