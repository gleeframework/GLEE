Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I can meet you at $80, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.

Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $80, which is her value for the product.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a price better than John's offer."
