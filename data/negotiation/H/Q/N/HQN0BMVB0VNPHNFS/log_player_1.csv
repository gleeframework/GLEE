"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's a bit lower than your initial offer, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him for $11,000, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would still leave you with a good profit, and it's a fair price for the product's value. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $12,250. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, $12,250 is a good deal and it's within my minimum threshold.  It's better than selling to John for $12,000 and avoids further negotiation."
