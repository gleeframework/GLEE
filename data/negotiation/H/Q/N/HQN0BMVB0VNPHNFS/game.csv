"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's a bit lower than your initial offer, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would still leave you with a good profit, and it's a fair price for the product's value. Let's close this deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $12,250. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",12250.0,Bob,4,
