"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle on this.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
