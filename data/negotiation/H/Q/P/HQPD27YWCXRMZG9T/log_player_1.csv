{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a slight margin to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a profit for Alice. This approach aims to avoid a quick rejection and encourages Bob to engage in a back-and-forth, potentially leading to a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is still a decent amount, Alice is aiming for a higher profit and knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows her to counter with a price closer to her desired amount and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
