"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This demonstrates that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down considerably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal. He's still within his budget, so there's no reason to rush into a purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing a willingness to negotiate but also demonstrating that he won't be pushed around. This offer is closer to Alice's last offer, signaling that Bob is getting closer to his acceptable price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has lowered her price significantly.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting the offer and potentially increasing the price again is present. It's likely that Alice will not go much lower than $1,125,000, and accepting this offer is a good compromise.  It saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and it ensures he gets the product."
