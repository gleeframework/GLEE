Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product. I think it's something you'll find valuable.  My asking price is $150, but let me know if you'd like to discuss the price."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest.  If he's immediately turned off by the $150, he can counter-offer or walk away.  His response will provide valuable information for Alice to proceed. 
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has a safety net: John is willing to buy the product for $100. This knowledge allows Alice to be more confident in her negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  There's a balance to strike. If Alice's initial offer is too high, Bob might not even consider it, leading to a missed opportunity."
