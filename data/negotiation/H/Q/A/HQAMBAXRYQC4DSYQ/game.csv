"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer of $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product but my budget is limited.  Would you consider a price of $1,400,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I could consider coming down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still receive a good price. ",1500000.0,Bob,4,
