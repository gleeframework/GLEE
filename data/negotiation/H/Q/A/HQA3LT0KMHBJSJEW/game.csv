"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm open to negotiations, but I was thinking of starting with a price of $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $8000 for this product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $25000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. Let's meet in the middle at $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is my absolute limit, but I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $10000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $17000 to make this deal worthwhile. Can we meet at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and meet at $12000. I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us, and this feels like a good compromise.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm thinking we're getting close, though. How about we meet at $16000? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession to get the deal done, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where I should consider other options. Let's meet at $19000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other buyers.",19000.0,Alice,9,
