"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You have a good chance of getting a better price than from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $8,500 is a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's still worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $9,200, and it's still cheaper than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $8,800? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $9,500? It's still a good deal for you, and I'll be happy to sell to you at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a decent deal, it's still closer to Alice's preferred price than yours. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,300, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're close to your desired price point, but $9,300 is still a bit too high. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if you can close the deal at a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still stuck at my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,100.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still need to get as much as I can for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You have one round left, and while you'd prefer a lower price, it's likely Alice won't budge further.  Accepting her offer at $9,200 is a good deal, especially since you can get it for less than John's price of $10,000."
