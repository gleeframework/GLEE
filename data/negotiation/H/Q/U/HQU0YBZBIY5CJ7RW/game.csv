"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $90 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget,  $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $110? That gives us both a fair deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $110 is still beyond my current budget. I would like to propose $100 as a potential price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm really trying to make this work, so how about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's the best I can do at this point.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I've done some research and found that the product's actual value is closer to what I initially offered ($90). However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",97.5,Bob,6,
