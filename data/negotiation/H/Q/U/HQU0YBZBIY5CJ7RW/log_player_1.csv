{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Starts with a high price:** It's closer to my minimum value ($150) than Bob's perceived value ($80).
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** I can adjust the price down if Bob rejects the initial offer. 
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** The message conveys a positive attitude towards reaching a deal.

I'll be prepared to counter any offer Bob makes, and if negotiations stall, I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $90 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $150.  I'm still hoping to get closer to that value. I'll counteroffer Bob to try and get a better price, and if he rejects again, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget,  $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $110? That gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain value:** $110 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains positive and suggests a win-win situation.

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $110 is still beyond my current budget. I would like to propose $100 as a potential price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum value of $150, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to take one more step to try and get a better price. 

* **Staying persistent:**  I'll counteroffer one last time, trying to bridge the gap between our positions.
* **Close to minimum:** If this final offer fails, I'll be ready to sell to John for $150."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm really trying to make this work, so how about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's the best I can do at this point."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final counteroffer. It's a small compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Closing the Gap:** The offer is aimed at bridging the gap between our positions and finding a middle ground.
* **Clear Communication:** The message conveys a sense of finality, signaling to Bob that this is my best offer.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I've done some research and found that the product's actual value is closer to what I initially offered ($90). However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $97.5 is tempting, it's still quite far from my minimum value of $150. At this point, the negotiation has gone on long enough, and I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $150, which is a much better outcome for me."
