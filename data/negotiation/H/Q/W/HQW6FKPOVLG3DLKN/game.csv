"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, as long as it meets my quality expectations.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value this product brings.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but we're still quite a ways apart.  This product offers significant value that justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to consider $1,450,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to make a deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. If you're serious about selling this product, I believe this is the best option for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
