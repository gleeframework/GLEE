Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find my asking price to be fair. What do you say to $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still securing a great deal for Alice. 
* **John as a Back-up:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position. Alice won't settle for less than that amount.

**Why this strategy works:**

This approach balances ambition with a safety net. It aims high with Bob while ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on a guaranteed sale."
