""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $119, I'm aiming for the highest price Bob might accept while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price."
