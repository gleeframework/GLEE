"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposal.  I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a long way from what I'm willing to pay. How about $950,000? I'm serious about buying if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I value this opportunity with you and am willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer - I hope you see the value proposition here.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,600,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $1,000,000. Let me know if that works for you, otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
