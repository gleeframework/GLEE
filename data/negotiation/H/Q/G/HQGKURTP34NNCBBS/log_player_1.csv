"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,150,000. How about we try $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $1,075,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still confident I can get a bit more.  I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more.  Let's settle on $1,112,500. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to our desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1112500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but $1,112,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

It's getting close to the end of our rounds, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price,  $1,075,000 is a solid offer. It's better than selling to John, and it's a good compromise with Bob. I'm going to accept his offer."
