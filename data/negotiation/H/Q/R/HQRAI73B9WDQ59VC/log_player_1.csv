"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm rejecting it and will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still ensures I make a reasonable profit while leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 meets my minimum but offers no room for profit. John is also offering $150, so I will sell to John as I'm guaranteed the same amount and don't need to continue negotiating with Bob."
