"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,900,000 is still a bit too steep for me though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That sounds fair to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
