"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up for $10,000, so this is your chance to secure it at a slightly higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a classic negotiation tactic. She's trying to create a sense of urgency and fear of missing out to get you to pay above your maximum price. Since you have John as a backup option at $10,000, there's no logical reason to accept Alice's inflated price."
