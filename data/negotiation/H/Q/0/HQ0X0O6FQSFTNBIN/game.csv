"Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and it gives you a chance to acquire it before anyone else. Let me know your decision.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
