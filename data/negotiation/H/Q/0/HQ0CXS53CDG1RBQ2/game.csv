"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your desire for a lower price, $1200000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
