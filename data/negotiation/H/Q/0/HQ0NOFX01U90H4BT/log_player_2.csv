"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $11,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I get to sell it quickly. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
