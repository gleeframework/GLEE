"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal.

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $900000 at this time. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is still a great value for you, and it's closer to the original price I had in mind.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a great value for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept your offer of $1000000. I'm starting to think that we may be too far apart, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to come to an agreement. However, I'm willing to make one final offer to you. I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
