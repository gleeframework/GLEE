Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and the high demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, she should aim higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,190,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justify the Price:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""high demand"" to justify the price above Bob's valuation. 

**Why this strategy is better than offering a lower price:**

* **Loss of Potential Profit:** Offering a price closer to $1,000,000 significantly reduces Alice's potential profit, especially since she has a guaranteed buyer at a higher price.
* **Underselling:** A low offer might make Bob suspicious of the product's value or lead him to believe he could have gotten an even better deal."
