"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, my budget is a bit tight, and I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's still a good deal for you.",850000.0,Bob,4,
