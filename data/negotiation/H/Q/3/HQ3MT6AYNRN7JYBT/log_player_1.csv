Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Offering it at $100 gives Bob a perceived discount and a strong incentive to buy. 
* **Maximizing Your Profit:**  While you could try for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might reject it. This offer aims to secure a good profit ($20) while still being appealing to Bob.
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John if Bob refuses, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
