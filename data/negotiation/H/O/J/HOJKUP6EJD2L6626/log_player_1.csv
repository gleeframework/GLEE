Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it has the potential to be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is still above Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob increases his incentive to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000 from John) and Bob's likely range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000 from John). Accepting this offer would be a huge financial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is interested, so there's potential to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and trying to find a price point that both of us can agree on."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little to $850,000. This price reflects the value the product brings and is still a good deal for you. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him that he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone helps keep the negotiation going. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would mean a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation Room:** While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, there's still some room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob. I will try to find a price point that is closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being attractive to Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to drop to $825,000 for this incredible product. This price reflects the value it brings to you, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I continue to highlight the value of the product to Bob.
* **Final Offer Tone:**  I use a slightly more assertive tone, suggesting that this might be my final offer before considering John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a successful negotiation.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John for $1,000,000 as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
