Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm still confident in its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850000, but I'm still a little hesitant at that price.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $800000.  This feels like a good middle ground for us both.",800000.0,Bob,4,
