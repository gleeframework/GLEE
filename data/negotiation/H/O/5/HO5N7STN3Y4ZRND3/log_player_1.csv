"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This product truly offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $12,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to pay $9,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Explanation:  While continuing to negotiate with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, it's becoming clear he's unlikely to meet the minimum threshold. Selling to John guarantees the $10,000, avoids further negotiation, and ensures a profit."
