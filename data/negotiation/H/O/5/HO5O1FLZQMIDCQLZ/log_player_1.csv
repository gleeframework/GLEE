Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm better off negotiating further or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is too low for me. Could you do $120?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $90 is a reasonable compromise. It avoids the risk of Bob walking away and ensures a profit."
