Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 tempts Bob with a price higher than his perceived value ($120) but offers a significant discount compared to what John will pay. This increases the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, there might be room for slight negotiation with Bob if he counters. However, remember your minimum acceptable price is $150."
