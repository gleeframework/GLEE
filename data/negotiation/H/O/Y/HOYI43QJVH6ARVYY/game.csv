"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value and benefits this product offers, I'm prepared to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Would you be willing to consider this compromise?",10500.0,Bob,4,
