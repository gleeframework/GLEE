{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I was quoted by another seller. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a fair price for what you were quoted elsewhere, I'm confident my product offers unique value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is my absolute minimum. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the value of my product to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although $85 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident I can get my desired price with John, so I'll choose to sell to him instead."
