"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $110 is still more than I'm hoping to spend. Could we try something around $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $90?",90.0,Alice,5,
