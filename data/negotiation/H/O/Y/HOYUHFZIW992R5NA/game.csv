"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
