I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be careful about how much I'm willing to concede. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous offer, but I'm also starting to consider selling to John."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I'm running out of time and Bob is not willing to budge much further. I'd rather get a slightly lower price than my minimum, which is what John is offering, than continue negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with an even lower price."
