"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This should encourage Bob to counteroffer and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to make a counteroffer and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more, as it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also shows that I'm not desperate for a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $75.  How about we try $85? That's a good compromise, and it ensures we both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm going to offer $85 to Bob in this round.  This is closer to his value, but still provides some profit for me. I'm hoping this will push Bob to accept or at least counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
