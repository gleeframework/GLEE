Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit above our minimum.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a ""limited time"" element can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without overthinking. 

**Important:** If Bob rejects this offer, we know we have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, ensuring we never sell below our minimum."
