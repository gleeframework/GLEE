"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $11,500.  I'm really interested in the product, but I have a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $11,500 from Bob is a better outcome than taking John's offer of $12,000. It's close enough to my minimum, and a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
