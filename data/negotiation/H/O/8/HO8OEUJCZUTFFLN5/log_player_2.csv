"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what the market typically offers. Considering its worth to you, I propose a price of $15,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  This is a fair price given my needs and the market value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. I am unable to accept $10,000 for this product. My counteroffer is $13,500. I believe this price reflects the product's true value while remaining competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my budget, but it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  If I reject, I might be able to get the price down to $11,000 or $12,000, which would be a good deal for both of us.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice for now, but I'm keeping the option of buying from John open if I can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $12,000?  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
