"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price reflects the immense value and potential this product holds.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth a lot, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
