{

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,400. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is making concessions, it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000.  At this point, accepting John's offer of $10,000 is the best option to ensure you get the product at the best possible price for you."
