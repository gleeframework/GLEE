"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming to me.  While I do think it's a great product, $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last counteroffer? Would you be willing to do $9,625?",9625.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,400. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10400.0,Alice,5,
