Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're willing to be flexible, which is important for getting Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still potentially get a better price. By rejecting, you can counteroffer and try to close the gap between his offer and your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $8,700? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit short. How about $8400? I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is $400 higher than what John would pay. While it's still not your desired price, it's a good compromise, and it's likely the best you'll get.  Accepting his offer maximizes your profit in this situation."
