"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe will significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, I understand its true worth to be $1,200,000. However, I am extending an exclusive offer to you at a price that reflects its immense value while ensuring a favorable transaction for both parties. Considering the market dynamics and the importance of this opportunity for us, I propose to sell the product to you for $950,000. This offer includes all necessary support and customization services to ensure a seamless integration into your existing systems. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of a mutually beneficial partnership. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than her own valuation of $800,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* While you could buy from John for $1,200,000, there's a good chance you can get a better price from Alice with a counter-offer.  

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price. This opens the door for further negotiation and a potentially better deal."
