"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer allows me to assess how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how flexible he might be in negotiations.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $800,000. This safety net gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, reflecting the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is better than our fallback option (selling to John for $800,000). However, it's still significantly lower than our initial ask.  Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about a higher price and keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better outcome. We have room to negotiate before going below Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product will generate significant value for you. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his offer ($850,000) and our previous ask ($950,000). It shows a willingness to compromise but holds firm on a price above our guaranteed sale option.
* **Maintaining Value:** This price still reflects the high value of the product and positions us for a potentially stronger negotiating position in subsequent rounds if needed. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While we have rounds remaining, reaching an agreement sooner rather than later is generally preferable. This offer strikes a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to go up to $875,000. This demonstrates my genuine interest in this product, but it's the highest I can go right now. Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is a significant profit over our guaranteed sale to John ($800,000). 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, suggesting this is likely close to his upper limit. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely. Accepting now secures a very good deal without further uncertainty."
