Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming to earn more than $100.
* **It's open to negotiation:**  This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **It includes a message:**  This personalizes the offer and provides context.

By offering a higher price initially, you have room to negotiate down if necessary, while still potentially achieving a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I was hoping to find it at a lower price. Could we negotiate down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than $100, you can likely do better. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? I think that's a fair price that still lets me make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $130 as my offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is not your ideal price, it's still better than selling to John for $100.  It's also a reasonable compromise considering the back and forth negotiation.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
