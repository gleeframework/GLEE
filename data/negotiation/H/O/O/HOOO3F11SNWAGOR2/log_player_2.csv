"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try and negotiate, especially when you have a clear upper limit in mind ($15,000).  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's roughly 2/3 of Alice's initial offer. This is a strong opening move that signals my intention to negotiate seriously while still leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my target, but I can still do better.  By rejecting the offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $7,500. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying within my budget.  I believe this is a fair price point and shows Alice that I'm serious about reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,200 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still within my budget and can likely get a slightly lower price. I'm confident that I can still negotiate down further, so I'll reject the offer and try again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $7,800, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows my willingness to compromise while also pushing for a lower price. I'm nearing my goal of getting the product for under $8,000, and with only a few rounds left, I need to continue demonstrating my serious intent to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, I'm very close to my target price of $7,500.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially increasing her price again is high. With only a few rounds remaining, the chance of getting a better deal is unlikely. Accepting the offer for $8,100 ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher cost."
