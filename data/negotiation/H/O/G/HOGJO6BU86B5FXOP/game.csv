"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $13,000 is still too far from what I have in mind.  Would you consider $10,000? That's a significant offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could come down to $12,000. This is my final offer, as it's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",12000.0,Alice,5,
