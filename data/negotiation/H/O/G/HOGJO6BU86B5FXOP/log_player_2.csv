Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could come down to $12,000. This is my final offer, as it's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $12,000, which is her value for the product.  She's signaled this is her final offer. While you might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's unlikely to be a significant difference.  Buying from John at $8,000 ensures you get the product at the best possible price for you."
