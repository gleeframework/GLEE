"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done quickly.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is still fair, considering the value to me, and allows both of us to come out ahead.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you proposed. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to get this deal done.",875000.0,Alice,3,
