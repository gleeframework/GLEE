"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is still fair, considering the value to me, and allows both of us to come out ahead."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you proposed. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $875,000. This is a better deal than John's offer of $1,000,000 and still leaves room for Alice to make a decent profit. Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product at a significant discount while also securing the deal.  Further negotiation might get a slightly better price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal to John."
