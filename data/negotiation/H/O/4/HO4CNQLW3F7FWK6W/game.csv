"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's quality, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? It's a fair price that considers its value to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In light of our discussion, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product.
