"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I make a good profit. 
* **Reasoning:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so I believe he'll be willing to negotiate within a reasonable range. 
* **Strategy:** By starting high, I aim to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for counteroffers in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my starting price of $1,200,000, and it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.
* **Reasoning:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price for me. Selling to John right now would result in a lower profit.
* **Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round and try to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Reasoning:** I believe this price is fair, as it's in the middle ground between our previous offers. It also allows for further negotiation while ensuring I get a good return on the product.
* **Strategy:** By making a counteroffer, I'm showing flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position. I hope to reach an agreement in this round or in the next few rounds before resorting to selling to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still lower than what I'd like to get.
* **Reasoning:** I'm still confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  Selling to John right now would be less profitable.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially close the deal closer to my desired price."

{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

* **Reasoning:** We're getting closer to an agreement.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product for both of us.
* **Strategy:**  I'm trying to close the deal in this round. I've made concessions, showing willingness to negotiate, and hope to get a final agreement before selling to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $900,000 is still lower than I'd like, it's only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Reasoning:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and I risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Strategy:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit. It's a calculated risk, but given the time constraints and the possibility of losing the deal, it's the best option at this stage."
