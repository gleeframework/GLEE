Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering the product's quality and worth.,180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $140. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $140. I understand that it's a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $160, which is still a good deal considering the product's value. Let me know if that works for you.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $160 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $150, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're able to accept that.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already gone down to $160 from my initial offer of $180, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $160, which would be $155. It's the best I can do. Let me know if that works for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
