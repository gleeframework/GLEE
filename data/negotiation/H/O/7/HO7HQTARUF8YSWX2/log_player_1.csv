"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling but am open to finding a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired range. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my target price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, acknowledging that Bob may not be willing to pay my initial asking price. However, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is getting closer to my minimum and is definitely a better deal than selling to John.  With only 6 rounds left, I'm willing to accept this offer."
