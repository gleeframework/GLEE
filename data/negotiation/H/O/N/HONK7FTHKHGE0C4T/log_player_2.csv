* You have a better alternative of buying from John for $10,000.
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a lower offer than my maximum budget of $10,000 to give Alice some room to negotiate. 
* This counteroffer gives me a good chance to save money, as I'm still willing to pay a significant amount for the product.
* If Alice rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on her response and my remaining options."

* There's still room for negotiation with Alice, as she lowered her price slightly. I'll try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by dropping her price to $11,000.
* I'm increasing my offer slightly from $9,000 to $9,500, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* This offer still leaves some room for negotiation but is closer to my target price of $10,000.
* If Alice rejects, I can decide if I'm willing to go higher or accept the deal with John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.
* I have a guaranteed alternative with John, who is selling the product for $10,000. 
* While there is a chance Alice might lower her price further, it's not guaranteed, and I risk spending more than my desired budget.  It's time to secure the deal with John to avoid further potential negotiation costs."
