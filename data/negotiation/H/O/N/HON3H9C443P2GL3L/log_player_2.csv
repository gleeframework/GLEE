"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.  This is a great deal for both of us, as I know it's worth more to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still more than what the product is worth to Bob ($100).  Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer and consider other options."
