"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in this product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly unique. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
