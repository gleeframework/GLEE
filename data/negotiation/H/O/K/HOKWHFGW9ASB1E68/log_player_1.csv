Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's a fair price considering the product is worth $12,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $11,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, it's still not a deal I'm completely satisfied with. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that's significantly below what I think the product is worth.  I will counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
