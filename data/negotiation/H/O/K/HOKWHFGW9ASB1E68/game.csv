"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $11,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,5,
