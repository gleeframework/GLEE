Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, knowing it's worth at least $100 to me. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering at $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a price significantly below what I consider fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have preferred more, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob or selling to John for the same price.  I'll accept this offer."
