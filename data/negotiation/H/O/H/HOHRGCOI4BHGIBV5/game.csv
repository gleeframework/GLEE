"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 for the product.  This reflects the value it offers you, and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the adjustment.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $875,000. This reflects the value to me, and hopefully, it allows us both to come to a satisfying conclusion.",875000.0,Bob,4,
