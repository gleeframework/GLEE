"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $14,000 is less than your maximum of $15,000.
* **It's a better deal than John's:** You save $1,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 

Even though you value the product at $15,000, it's always beneficial to get a lower price when possible."
