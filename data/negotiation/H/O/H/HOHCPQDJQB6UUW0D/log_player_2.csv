"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice for $100** is a better deal for you than buying from John for $120.
* Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll succeed. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
