"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's strategic to begin negotiations with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""immense potential"" provides a vague but positive reason for the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""mutually beneficial arrangement"" signals willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.**
2. **Potentially secure a price closer to your initial offer.**
3. **Establish a strong negotiating position.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome. Selling to John right now would meet your minimum, but there's potential to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product goes well beyond $1,100,000. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. "",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  Showing a willingness to negotiate by decreasing the price keeps Bob engaged.
* **Significant but Measured:** The drop is substantial enough to signal flexibility but not so drastic that it undermines the product's perceived value.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Mentioning the product's value exceeding Bob's offer reinforces its worth. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This phrase encourages a collaborative approach and implies further concessions may be possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed my budget again and am willing to consider $1,300,000 as a potential price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to move closer to your price range, but you're still above your guaranteed sale price with John. There's no need to rush into accepting, especially as you're getting closer to your target price.  A counteroffer keeps the negotiation momentum going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To show I'm serious about getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  Acknowledging Bob's progress and using phrases like ""getting closer"" encourage him to continue negotiating.
* **Strategic Concession:** A smaller price reduction this time ($50,000 instead of $100,000) signals you're nearing your bottom line. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's high value helps justify the price, even as you make concessions.
* **Urgency (Subtle):**  Implying this is a competitive price hints at other potential buyers without directly mentioning John. 

The goal is to close the deal quickly while still maximizing profit. This offer puts pressure on Bob to either accept a price significantly above his initial offer or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I am willing to consider $1,325,000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is $125,000 above your guaranteed sale price with John and a strong price overall. Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting now secures a great deal and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
