Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,250? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $11,100.  Let's make this deal happen.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $11,100. It's a good price and saves me some money compared to John's offer."
