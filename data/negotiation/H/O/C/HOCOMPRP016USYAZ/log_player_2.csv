Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $95. I can do $105, and that's as close to the middle as I'm willing to get. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $100, and you're better off securing the guaranteed $80 deal with John."
