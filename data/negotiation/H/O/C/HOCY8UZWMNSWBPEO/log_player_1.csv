Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $1,450,000 is still a great deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **It's profitable for you:**  You earn significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It mitigates risk:**  If Bob rejects, you still have a guaranteed sale with John.

This strategy aims to find the sweet spot where you maximize your earnings while still ensuring a high probability of a sale to Bob."
