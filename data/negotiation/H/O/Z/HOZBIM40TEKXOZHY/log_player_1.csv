"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price. I know the product is worth more to me than to Bob, so I'm hoping to get as close to my value as possible.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to assess whether it's worth continuing to negotiate or if it's better to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's too far below my minimum value, and I'm hoping to get closer to $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground.  $11,500 is a significant step up from Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Hopefully, this will entice him to come up a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his offer. It seems like he's not going to come closer to my desired price, and I've already had two rounds where he has rejected my counteroffers. I'm running out of time and I'm not confident that I can close the deal with him.  I'm going to sell to John for $12,000 to ensure I get my minimum value."
