"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for cheaper from John.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to make this deal work.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $11,000, he's getting a better deal than what John is offering, and he's also saving money compared to his initial counteroffer.  There's no guarantee that he can get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
