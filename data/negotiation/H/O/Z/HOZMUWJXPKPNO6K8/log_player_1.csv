{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to accept given the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to make this deal work. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
