"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $135 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $157.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.",157.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, $157.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $152.50? That's the highest I can go.",152.5,Bob,4,
