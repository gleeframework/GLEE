"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While it's better than his initial offer, I still want to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $135 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $157.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 157.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, $157.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $152.50? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiations or selling to John for less."
