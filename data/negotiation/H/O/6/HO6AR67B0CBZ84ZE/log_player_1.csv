"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $8,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $8,500.  This would allow me to make this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm feeling the pressure to make a deal, Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price. There are still rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product. Let's compromise at $8,000 - that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7200. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,200 is still below my minimum value of $8,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate, we've reached a point where further rounds are unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John at $8,000 ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further haggling."
