"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth more to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for an even lower price."
