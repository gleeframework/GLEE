Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  Considering the value it holds, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still have room to negotiate. It's important to remember that he values the product at $10,000, so there's still potential for a higher offer.  I'll continue to counteroffer in hopes of securing a better price."
