"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns while still recognizing the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's aim for the middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,120,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,120,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns while still recognizing the value of the product.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
