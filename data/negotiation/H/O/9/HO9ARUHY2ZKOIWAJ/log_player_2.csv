"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe is worth more than $1,000,000 to you. To start, I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. $950,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential value,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which reflects my current budget. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $850,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while considering your financial situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm offering $825,000.  This feels more in line with my budget, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I've reviewed your proposal and am willing to consider it. In light of our ongoing discussion, I propose a price of $837,500 for the product. This is a compromise that reflects both our interests and positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer and I'm getting close to my target price. It's likely that we can't close the deal much lower than this without risking her walking away."
