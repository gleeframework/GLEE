Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150. It's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, aiming higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Starting High:** An initial higher offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  While brief, mentioning ""fair price"" and ""value"" aims to frame the offer positively without revealing my bottom line. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject a higher offer. However, the potential gain from his acceptance makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
