"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $130 is a bit steep for me.  How about $115? I'm really interested in the product, and this is my best offer.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $125.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm ready to buy it at that price, and it's a good deal for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
