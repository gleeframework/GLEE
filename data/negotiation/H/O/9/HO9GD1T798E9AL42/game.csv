"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10000 is simply too low for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down to $12500, which still allows me to make a fair profit.  This is a significant offer considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $11250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11250.0,Bob,4,
