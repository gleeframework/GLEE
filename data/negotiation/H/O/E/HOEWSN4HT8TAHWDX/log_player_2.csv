"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm happy to initiate the conversation by offering it to you for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There are 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the offer and providing your perspective. While $1,050,000 is a respectable figure, it falls a bit short of what I had in mind. In the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price.  There are still rounds left to negotiate, so Bob should try to push for a lower price. He can likely get a better deal if he counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the value of the product, I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This price is a fair compromise, closer to your value and within my budget. I believe this is a good opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find common ground.  While I acknowledge your offer, I'm still seeking a price point closer to my initial valuation.  Therefore, I propose a price of $1,090,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,090,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he can still do better. There are five rounds remaining, and Bob can likely secure a deal closer to his target price by counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,090,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
