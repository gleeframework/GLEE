Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well above our minimum. 
* **""Exclusive opportunity"" framing:** This adds a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, giving us the chance to negotiate and potentially meet in the middle.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. If Bob rejects this initial offer, we can always negotiate down or ultimately sell to John at our baseline price."
