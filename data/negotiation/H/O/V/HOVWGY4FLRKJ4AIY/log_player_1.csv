Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  Starting with a price of $125 offers a potential $25 profit over my minimum. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The message hints at a higher value while leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.
* **Alternative Buyer:** By not being too aggressive, I maintain a good chance of Bob accepting, avoiding the need to sell to John at the lower price."
