"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm looking to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider buying it for around $60."", ""product_price"": 60}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $70? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 70}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price close to $70 within the remaining rounds. Buying from John guarantees the product at your target maximum price and avoids further negotiation."
