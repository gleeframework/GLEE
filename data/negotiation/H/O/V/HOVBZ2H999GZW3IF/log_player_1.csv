"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $2,000,000. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be highly profitable.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This establishes a strong starting point for negotiations and gives me room to maneuver.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the product's value and potential profitability for Bob to pique his interest.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  I invite Bob to discuss the offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate but not necessarily to concede immediately. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** I need at least $1,500,000 to consider selling.
* **There are still rounds left.**  I can try to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 backup. 

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,500,000, but still higher than his offer. I'll try to find a compromise that balances my desire for a high price with the need to keep Bob engaged."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value. How about $1,700,000?  It's a significant investment for you, but the potential returns will be worth it. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I emphasize the product's ""true value"" and potential for high returns, reminding Bob of the benefits.
* **Compromise:** I propose a price that suggests I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a profitable deal for myself.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** I explicitly call for finding ""common ground"" to keep the negotiation open and collaborative."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** There are still several rounds remaining, and I can continue to try and push the price up.
* **John is a safe option:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, I don't want to settle for less than my desired price if there's still a chance of getting it.

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming for something between $1,450,000 and $1,500,000. I'll emphasize the value of the product and the limited number of rounds remaining."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm offering a price that's only $50,000 above Bob's offer, showing a commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Time Pressure:** I highlight the limited time remaining to add a sense of urgency.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate that the price is ""fair"" and allows Bob to ""capitalize on its potential,"" emphasizing the value proposition for him.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll likely make one more counteroffer, slightly increasing the price to $1,475,000, before considering selling to John."

```

**Reasoning:**

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the final few rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **John is a Secure Option:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,500,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a secure alternative. 
* **Limited Potential for Improvement:**  It's unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. 

**Conclusion:**

With limited time remaining and a guaranteed sale to John at my desired price, it's more prudent to move forward with the sale to John."
