"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I agree the product is valuable,  $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. Could you do $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,500, which is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $13,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
