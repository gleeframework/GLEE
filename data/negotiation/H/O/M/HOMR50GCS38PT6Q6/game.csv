"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1280000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to come to an agreement at this price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price, considering the product is worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm counteroffering at $1300000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
