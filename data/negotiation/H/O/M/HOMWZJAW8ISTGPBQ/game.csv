"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Could you consider a lower price, closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $14,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $15,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
