"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to reach a price that works for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $11500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  I'm hoping to get closer to $10,000 in the next round. I'm still open to negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I see that we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to your offer, but I still think we can do better. Would you be willing to go down to $9200? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying the product if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer, but it's not enough.  I've reached a point where I'm more comfortable selling to John for $10,000.  This is a safe option that guarantees me my minimum desired value.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
