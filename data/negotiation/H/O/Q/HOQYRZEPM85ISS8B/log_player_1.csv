Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. I'm also keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm offering $105, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  The message is positive and emphasizes a fair outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $95 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than selling to John for $80, and it's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away.  It's time to close the deal."
