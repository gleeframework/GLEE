"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $13,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your own value for the product.  Let's make this happen!",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,500. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
