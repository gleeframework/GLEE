"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,5,
