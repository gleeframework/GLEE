Alice's starting price is already a good deal, but there's room for negotiation. I should aim lower to see if I can save even more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000.

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  I'll try a counteroffer a bit closer to her price to see if we can settle without going to John's price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.
