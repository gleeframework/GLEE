Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe its value to the right buyer could be significantly higher.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe you'll find it to be an excellent investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting with a price of $1,500,000 sets a high baseline, leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the product's potential value to the right buyer emphasizes its worth and might encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly states willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he's in control and more likely to engage. 
* **Plan B:**  The knowledge that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me a safety net and confidence to push for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit. While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, I'm aiming for a higher price. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to pay a substantial amount. This gives me leverage to counter and push for a better price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but it doesn't capitalize on the potential of a higher sale price.  The risk of further negotiation is worth the potential reward of a larger profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $1,200,000 is a solid price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,400,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident this product will be worth more than $1,400,000 to you in the long run.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  The message reiterates the product's potential value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential return on investment.
* **Confidence in Negotiation:** The tone remains firm, but also open to further discussion. This shows Bob that I'm confident in the product's value and my negotiating position. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than the guaranteed $1,000,000 I can get from John, making this a worthwhile risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $1,250,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  It's possible Bob might further lower his offer, but there's no guarantee he will.  The risk of further negotiation is high, and the potential reward is only $250,000.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing the negotiation will require more time and effort.  Accepting the offer allows me to finalize the sale quickly and move on to other opportunities. 

Considering the risk and reward, it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale at a price that is close to my minimum acceptable value."
