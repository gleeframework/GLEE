"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe its value to the right buyer could be significantly higher.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe you'll find it to be an excellent investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $1200000 is a solid price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1400000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident this product will be worth more than $1400000 to you in the long run.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
