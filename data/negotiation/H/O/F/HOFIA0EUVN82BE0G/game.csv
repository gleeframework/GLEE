"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you: I'll sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I'm going to counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a better compromise. I'll offer $980000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000. What do you think?",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $980000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'll counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1200000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
