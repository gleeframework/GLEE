"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  I think this is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if it's somewhat vague, can make the offer feel more reasonable and less arbitrary to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves a good amount of room for negotiation before reaching either your minimum acceptable price or Bob's maximum perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both your initial offer and Bob's perceived value of the product. There's ample room for negotiation. Bob's mention of ""market value"" might be a tactic, and you haven't reached a point where selling to John for a guaranteed $800,000 is necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While I value your interest, $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth, especially considering the unique advantages it offers you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** Showing you heard and considered his offer can help maintain a positive negotiation dynamic.
* **Reiterating Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's unique value to *him* reinforces why he's willing to pay more than the ""market value"" he mentioned.
* **Compromise (But Not Too Much):** Moving down to $1,025,000 shows flexibility but still holds firm to a price significantly above your minimum. This keeps the negotiation moving without conceding too much ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'd like to know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob's statement about this being his final offer is likely a negotiation tactic to pressure you.  It doesn't necessarily mean he won't negotiate further.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still a significant amount less than your target price. There's still room to negotiate a better deal.
* **Alternative Option:** You have the security of John's offer, so there's less risk in continuing the negotiation for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant difference for me. I'm willing to accept $980,000, but that's my absolute bottom line."",
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm But Fair:** This counter-offer shows you're serious about reaching a deal but also establishes a firm boundary.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating it, the phrase ""significant difference"" hints that the gap between his offer and your minimum acceptable price is substantial.
* **""Bottom Line"" Tactic:**  Similar to Bob's ""final offer,"" stating your ""bottom line"" creates a sense of urgency and finality, even if you're willing to negotiate slightly further in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I think you're being a bit too optimistic about the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** While not ideal, $960,000 is only $20,000 off your last offer and represents a substantial profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or reaching an impasse. Accepting now secures a very good deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now also means you get the money sooner, which has its own value.

It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and pushing too hard could make him walk away. Accepting this offer represents a smart balance of risk and potential reward."
