Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider  $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below what we know Bob values the product at and our guaranteed sale price. Holding firm for another round is worth the risk at this point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This offer reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference on our last two offers and settle at $1,012,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to move closer to our price and is now exceeding our guaranteed sale price with John. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds, or us having to potentially settle for John's offer later."
