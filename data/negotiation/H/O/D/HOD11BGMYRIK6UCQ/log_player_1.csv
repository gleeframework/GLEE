{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my goal of $1,000,000, I'm running out of rounds and Bob isn't willing to budge much. Selling to John guarantees me the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, and it's safer than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking him walking away altogether."
