"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further and potentially get an even better deal.  It's unlikely Alice would accept a counteroffer immediately, but it's a strategy to see if you can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. It's a bold move that signals your intent to pay a lower price. While there's a chance Alice will reject it outright, it also creates an opportunity to see how far she's willing to go to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, which is a good sign. However, you still have some room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to get an even lower price. There's a chance you can get closer to your target of $1,000,000.  Remember, you can always walk away and buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so this counteroffer builds upon the previous round. By offering $1,100,000, you are  showing that you are willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price. It is a reasonable offer that might be attractive to Alice, but it also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,180,000 is a reasonable compromise. While it's not the absolute lowest price you were aiming for, it's significantly better than John's offer of $1,500,000.  Considering you have been pushing for a lower price and are unsure if you'll get a better offer from Alice in the next round, accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
