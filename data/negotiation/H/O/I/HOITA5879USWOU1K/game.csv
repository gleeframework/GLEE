"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know you value it highly as well.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price that allows me to get a decent return while offering you a slight discount on its true value. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
