Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price is $15,000**.  I know I can get that from John.
* **Bob values the product at $10,000**.  This means I need to find a price that is higher than his value but lower than my minimum. 
* **$14,000 is a reasonable offer.** It gives Bob a potential $4,000 in value, which is significant, and it's still $1,000 more than my minimum.  

This strategy maximizes my chance of getting a higher price while still considering Bob's willingness to pay."
