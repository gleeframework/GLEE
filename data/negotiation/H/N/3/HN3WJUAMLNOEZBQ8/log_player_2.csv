"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth is $8,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal considering the product's worth to him, he can likely get a better price by negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to spend closer to $7,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $7,500, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer, Bob can still do better. He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is willing to go down to $8,200.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8,100 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it."", ""product_price"": 8100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,100. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value you've acknowledged it has to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has already countered twice, and Alice is firm on her price.  While it's possible to keep negotiating, the risk is that Alice will not budge further, and Bob will end up with no deal and 10 rounds wasted. At this point, buying from John for $8,000 is the safest option to secure the product at a price within his budget."
