"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how interested he truly is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to sell. Bob has shown interest with his counteroffer, and I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating but I'm not willing to give away too much. This keeps the pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. $1,050,000 is close, but I think I can squeeze out a bit more in the remaining rounds.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell for less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a deal done and come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $1,000,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not desperate. There's still a chance I can negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm at my minimum price and I'm not willing to go any lower. This is a serious offer and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept. If he rejects, I'll have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations aren't going to get me any closer to my ideal price. Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum, and I'm unwilling to go lower. To avoid further time-wasting and ensure I receive at least my minimum value, I'll sell to John."
