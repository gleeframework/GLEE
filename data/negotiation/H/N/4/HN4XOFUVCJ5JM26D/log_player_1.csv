Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $9,500. "",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from the sale. Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $8,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($9,500) leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This price point suggests you understand the product's value to Bob without seeming overly greedy, increasing the chances he'll accept or counter-offer instead of outright rejecting the offer."
