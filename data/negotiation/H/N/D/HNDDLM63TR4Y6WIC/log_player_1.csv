Explanation:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still far away from a price that's acceptable to you.  At this point, the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is too significant to ignore. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
