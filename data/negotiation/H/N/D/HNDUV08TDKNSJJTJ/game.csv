"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1800000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. This is a significant investment for me and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1600000 is still a bit above my budget though. I'm prepared to pay $1400000 for this product,  and I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've discussed.  This is the absolute maximum I can offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your honesty about the maximum you're willing to pay. However, I'm not willing to go below $1500000. This is the minimum I need to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1500000, so I'm offering you $1450000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
