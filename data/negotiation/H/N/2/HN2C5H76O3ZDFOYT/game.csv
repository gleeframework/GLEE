"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'd really enjoy it.  Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. ",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $130, so how about we try $132.50? That's the best I can do.",132.5,Bob,6,
