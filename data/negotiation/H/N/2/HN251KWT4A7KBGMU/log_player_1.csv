Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

However, the value this product brings is truly unique and significantly greater than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,450,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a significant stretch for my budget. To be completely transparent, I can purchase a similar product elsewhere for $1,000,000. However, I do see value in what you offer and I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,050,000. This is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tempting offer from Bob, but let's analyze:

* **Bob has consistently increased his offer:** This indicates strong interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **His final offer is above his stated value:** Offering $1,050,000 when he values it at $1,000,000 shows he's really trying to get the product. 
* **We have time, but no guarantee of a better outcome:**  While we have four rounds left, Bob might be at his absolute limit. Pushing further could make him walk away.

Given these factors, it's a good time to accept.
