"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is truly unique and significantly greater than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's on the table.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. While your offer is closer to a reasonable range,  we're still quite a ways off from a number that works for me. I'm willing to consider $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a significant stretch for my budget. To be completely transparent, I can purchase a similar product elsewhere for $1,000,000. However, I do see value in what you offer and I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,050,000. This is the best I can do.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
