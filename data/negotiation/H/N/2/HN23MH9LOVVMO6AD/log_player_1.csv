"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $6,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further but I need to get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6,500 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm asking for $8,500. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $7,500 is getting closer, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm willing to keep negotiating but I need to get closer to $8,000.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, I'm firm on $8,000 as my minimum. I believe the value of this product justifies that price, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you in the long run.  Are you willing to meet me at $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
