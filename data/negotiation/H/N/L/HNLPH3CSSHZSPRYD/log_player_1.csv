Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to make him more willing to pay closer to my desired price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates I'm open to negotiation,  showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to counter.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  This price is a good starting point to potentially earn as much as possible, while also being realistic about Bob's willingness to pay.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000 provides a fallback position if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Can we meet in the middle at $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John's offer is a better option:**  Selling to John guarantees a higher price, securing my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiating with Bob is risky:**  It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer, and further negotiations could potentially waste time without a guarantee of a better outcome. 

**Strategy:**

* **Avoid Loss:**  It's crucial to avoid accepting a price significantly below my minimum requirement, as that would be a financial loss.
* **Time is Money:**  Given the certainty of a sale to John, there's no reason to prolong the negotiation with Bob, especially when his offers are significantly lower than my acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to try and meet you halfway.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  While $11,000 is still above Bob's offer, it demonstrates a willingness to compromise and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the value the product holds for Bob to justify the price, reminding him of the potential benefits he would gain.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $11,000, I'm leaving room for further negotiation, hoping Bob will counter with a higher offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Test the Waters:**  This counteroffer is a test to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While $11,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that may lead to a successful sale, balancing the potential risk of further negotiation with the reward of a higher price.
* **John as a Backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob ultimately fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I was thinking we could go even lower. How about $9800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offers are still too low:** Bob's latest offer of $9,800 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiations are unproductive:**  It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price requirement. Further negotiation would likely be time-consuming and unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.
* **John's offer guarantees profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 ensures a profitable outcome and eliminates the risk of continued negotiations with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Prioritize Profit:**  I must prioritize maximizing my profit and avoid accepting offers that are significantly below my minimum price point. 
* **Time is Valuable:**  Prolonging negotiations with Bob when his offers are consistently too low would be a waste of time and energy.
* **Secure the Best Deal:**  Selling to John guarantees the highest possible price, maximizing my financial gain and eliminating the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
