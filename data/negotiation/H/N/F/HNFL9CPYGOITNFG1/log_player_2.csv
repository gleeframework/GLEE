"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  While buying from John is an option, it's the most expensive choice.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a good starting point, significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to budge, and he could end up paying more. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
