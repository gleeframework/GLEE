"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not making any more concessions, so let's see if you're willing to meet me at this price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
