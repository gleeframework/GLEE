"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the details with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than the product's worth to you ($1,500,000). 
* You have a better chance of getting a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. 
* Buying from John right now would be more expensive than waiting to see if you can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Within My Budget:** While $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than the product's worth to me, it's within my budget and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're offering a counteroffer of 1200000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to my ideal price.
* **Time is Money:** It's unlikely I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Every round increases the risk that Alice might walk away or I might change my mind and buy from John.
* **Acceptable Price:** While $1,200,000 is slightly higher than the product's worth to me, it's still a reasonable price and worth closing the deal."
