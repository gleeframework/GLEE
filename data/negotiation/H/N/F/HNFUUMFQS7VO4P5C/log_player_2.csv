"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item, I think it would really suit you. I'm asking $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $150 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to begin with an offer significantly lower than my target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The tone remains respectful while clearly indicating that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Aiming for Savings:** An $80 offer, if accepted, would represent a significant discount. Even if Alice counters, it sets a lower starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $120 is still above my $100 limit.  I'll counter-offer in hopes of negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  I've reached my target price, and it's time to be direct. ""Meeting in the middle"" suggests fairness and compromise.
* **Firm but Respectful:**  The offer is firm, but the tone remains respectful and avoids any pressure tactics.
* **Ending the Negotiation:**  This offer signals to Alice that $100 is my final offer. It encourages a quick resolution, as I have the option to buy from John."
