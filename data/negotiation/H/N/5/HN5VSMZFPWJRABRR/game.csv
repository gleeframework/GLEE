"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $140 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $155, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",155.0,Alice,5,
