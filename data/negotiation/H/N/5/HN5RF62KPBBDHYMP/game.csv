"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value it brings.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,262,500?  This feels like a more balanced price that reflects both our needs.",1262500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the full value of this product.  I'd be willing to agree to $1,295,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1295000.0,Alice,5,
