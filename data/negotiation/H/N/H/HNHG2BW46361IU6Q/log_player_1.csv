Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, so I'm offering it to you for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer.  $6,000 is too low, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial offer.  How about $8,500? That would be a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $7,000? That's a significant price difference, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$7,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $7,000 is definitely a better offer than your previous one.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000 to make this work. This is a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
