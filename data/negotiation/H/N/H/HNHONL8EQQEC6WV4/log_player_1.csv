Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $115, which is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $100 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, aiming to build rapport with Bob. I highlight the product's value to entice him to accept. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I create an incentive for him to accept the offer. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and explore if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $105 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $110?  That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $110, which is halfway between my previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $105. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly, emphasizing compromise and fairness.  I'm aiming to maintain a good rapport with Bob during the negotiation process. 

This counteroffer aims to find common ground with Bob while ensuring I'm not settling for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the highest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's still a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's very close to it.  Considering Bob's continued insistence on $105, and the potential for further negotiation, I'm willing to accept his counteroffer. It's a better deal than what I would get from John, and it limits the risk of losing the sale altogether."
