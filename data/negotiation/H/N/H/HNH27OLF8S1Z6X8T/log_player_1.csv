"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $160. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120), but still below my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value and deal aspect to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being aggressive, but leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I have a better chance of getting a price closer to my desired range.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His counteroffer will tell me how serious he is about buying the product.
* **Keep the door open:** If Bob rejects, I can always switch to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired range, it's still below my $150 minimum. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have more rounds to work with, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Keeping the door open:** I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob don't work out. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest.  $140 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $145.  This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the negotiation friendly and encouraging. 

**Strategy:**

By offering $145, I'm aiming to:

* **Bridge the gap:** This price is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Test the waters:** I'll see if Bob is willing to meet halfway or if he needs further negotiation.
* **Maintain leverage:** I can still switch to John for $150 if this offer doesn't work."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm willing to negotiate, $130 is still below my $150 minimum. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I have several rounds left, and I can still potentially reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations don't work out, I can still sell to John for my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, trying to find a price that both of us can agree on. I might suggest a price closer to $140, aiming to meet halfway."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $130 is a bit low for me, let's split the difference. How about $140?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly between our last two offers, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness appeal:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" aspect of the offer to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm emphasizing the possibility of closing the deal to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to:

* **Find a mutually agreeable price:**  Hopefully, this offer is acceptable to Bob and allows us to reach a deal.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Splitting the difference often leads to quicker agreement.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I still have the option of selling to John if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, the chances of successfully negotiating a higher price are slim.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and ensures I don't lose money on this deal.

**Conclusion:**

Given Bob's persistent low offers and the dwindling number of negotiation rounds, it's best to secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better result outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
