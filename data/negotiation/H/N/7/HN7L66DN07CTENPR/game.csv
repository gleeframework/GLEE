"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, given my valuation and your stated worth.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still beyond what I can pay. Let's try $13,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and it's closer to your value.  I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",13000.0,Bob,4,
