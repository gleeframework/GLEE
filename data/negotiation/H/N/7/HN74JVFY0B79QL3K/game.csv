,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $890,000. This price reflects the significant value this product offers you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, but $890,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $880,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",880000.0,Bob,6,
