Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really benefit from it. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, giving Bob a reason to consider the offer.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and focused on the potential benefits for Bob. I'm not explicitly mentioning my minimum price or the fact that I have another buyer. This avoids putting Bob on the defensive and allows for a smoother negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counter-offering at $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a price that's closer to my desired outcome.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing a willingness to negotiate. I'm highlighting the value of the product to reinforce my stance on the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still too low for me.  It's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me. John is guaranteed to pay my minimum price, so it's the safer and more profitable option."
