"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand you see value in the product, but $600,000 significantly undervalues it.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,050,000.  I believe this reflects a fair price given the product's true value and my desire to reach an agreement with you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see this is important to you, and I am willing to go up a bit. How about $800,000? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
