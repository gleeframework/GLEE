"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down a bit?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  Let's try to close the gap - how about $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000 yet. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm feeling like we're getting close.  I could do $1,025,000 to get this done today.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,025,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
