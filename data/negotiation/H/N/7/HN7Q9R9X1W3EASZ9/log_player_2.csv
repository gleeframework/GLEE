Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,025,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.

This is a tough one! We're getting into the later rounds, and while I could probably squeeze out a bit more from Alice, it's getting riskier. $1,075,000 is a decent price, and waiting longer increases the chance of ending up with John's $1,500,000 offer.  Let's take the sure win here."
