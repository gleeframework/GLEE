Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it!  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you don't sell the product for less than what it's worth to you.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It allows for some give and take in the negotiation. 

By offering $100, you increase the chances of Bob accepting your offer, but also allow yourself to potentially get closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it is still below my minimum value for the product. By rejecting his offer and proceeding to the next round, I can attempt to negotiate a higher price that better reflects the product's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Bob, I appreciate you're trying to get a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $95, but I can't go any lower than that.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $95 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is still lower than my ideal price, it's a better deal than selling to John for $120. By accepting Bob's offer, I can ensure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
