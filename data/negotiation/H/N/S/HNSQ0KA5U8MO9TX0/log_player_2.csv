"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $80 from John, so it's not worth accepting Alice's offer of $100.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $85 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $95 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than what you can get from John.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal."
