Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but below your minimum acceptable value of $120. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also sets a clear expectation of what you're looking for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $85 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
