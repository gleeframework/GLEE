"I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher return, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,000. How about we meet at $11,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
