"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone aims to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the potential benefits of the product might entice Bob to see its value. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and reactions throughout the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but I'm only willing to pay $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:**  While $800,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet, especially since it's the first counteroffer.
* **Negotiation Space:**  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Time is on my side:**  With 9 rounds left, I have time to explore other possibilities and see if Bob's willingness to pay might increase. 

**Next Move:** I'll send a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $800,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to compromise slightly. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This still gives you a good price, and it allows me to move closer to my desired value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not accepting it outright. 
* **""Meet in the middle"" Approach:** This language suggests a fair compromise and avoids appearing too stubborn. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's worth and the potential value Bob will gain.

**Next Steps:**  I'll be closely watching Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to reassess my strategy and consider options for future rounds."
