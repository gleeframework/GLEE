"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's better than John's price, you have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a respectable offer, the product's value is truly significant.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,350,000. This reflects the value it holds for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within your budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially increasing her price again, coupled with the fact that you can buy from John for a higher price, makes accepting Alice's offer the best decision."
