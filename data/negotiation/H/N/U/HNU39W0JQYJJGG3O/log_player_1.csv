I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth more to Bob.  By starting high, I hope to maximize my earnings while still being open to a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I was hoping for, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. However, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.  I'm confident I can close a deal closer to my initial asking price."

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This demonstrates flexibility, but it's still a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still allowing me to make a substantial profit."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation and make a counteroffer. I'm hoping to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a fair offer considering Bob's previous counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, and I'm hopeful that it will lead to a successful agreement."

```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $800,000.  Although I was hoping for a higher price from Bob, the negotiations have dragged on, and I'm concerned that continuing to bargain with Bob could result in a further decrease in the price, potentially even below John's offer.  I believe it's best to secure a guaranteed sale with John and move forward."
