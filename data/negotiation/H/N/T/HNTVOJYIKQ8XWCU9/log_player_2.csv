"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product, and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price point of $10,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price.  Buying from John immediately is also an option, but Bob has 10 rounds to potentially secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within his budget. This establishes a starting point for negotiation and signals Bob's seriousness about getting a deal.
* **Room for negotiation:**  A $9,000 offer leaves room for both parties to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Positive tone:** Bob maintains a friendly and cooperative tone in his message, making it more likely that Alice will be receptive to further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum price point of $10,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:** There's still room for compromise, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to budge further.
* **Avoiding a bad deal:** Accepting at $11,500 would be a worse deal than buying from John immediately.

**Counteroffer Strategy (for the next round):**

Bob could offer a price slightly above his $9,000 counteroffer, perhaps $9,500 or $9,800, to demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my range. How about we settle on $10,000? This is my final offer, as it aligns with my budget. I'm confident that this product is worth it for both of us at this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer explicitly states that Bob is willing to pay his maximum price. This creates pressure on Alice to accept as she knows further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.
* **Highlighting Value:** By mentioning the product's worth, Bob subtly reminds Alice that this price is still beneficial to her.
* **Staying within Budget:** Bob is firmly sticking to his budget constraint, ensuring he doesn't overpay."
