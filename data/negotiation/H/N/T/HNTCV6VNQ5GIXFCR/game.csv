"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is way above what I'm willing to pay.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  I'm very interested in the product and hope we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $8,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is a very competitive price for the value you're getting.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $19,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I'm motivated to find a solution that works for us both.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to do business with you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
