"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's well over your maximum budget of $8,000.  There's no point in accepting it.  You should reject and counteroffer to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is way above what I'm willing to pay.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  I'm very interested in the product and hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $8,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is a very competitive price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she has lowered the price, it's still significantly above your budget. You need to continue negotiating and see if you can get a lower price. You can afford to reject this offer and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $19,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I'm motivated to find a solution that works for us both.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to do business with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's try to reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
