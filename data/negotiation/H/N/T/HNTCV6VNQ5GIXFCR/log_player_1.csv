Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way above what I'm willing to pay.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  I'm very interested in the product and hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $8,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $19,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's try to reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000 and unlikely to budge significantly.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
