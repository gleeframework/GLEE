"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,950,000?  This reflects some flexibility on my end while still recognizing the value this brings.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,950,000 is still out of my reach.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to what I believe is a fair price.  Let's find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
