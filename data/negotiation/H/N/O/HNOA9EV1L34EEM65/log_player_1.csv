"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value but not too high to scare Bob off immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $115. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $110 is a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
