"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way too high. You're not willing to pay more than $80, and John is offering it at that price. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $80. How about we split the difference and go for $90? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to your budget, you're still aiming for $80. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $85. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $85 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for, but I'm open to continuing to negotiate. How about $88?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still holding out for that $80 price. While Alice is getting closer, it's worth seeing if you can get her to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm very close to your price but I can't quite go to $88 yet.  How about $87? It's a small difference and would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 87}
