"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in that price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $80. How about we split the difference and go for $90? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $85. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a deal. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $85 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for, but I'm open to continuing to negotiate. How about $88?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm very close to your price but I can't quite go to $88 yet.  How about $87? It's a small difference and would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you think?",87.0,Bob,6,
