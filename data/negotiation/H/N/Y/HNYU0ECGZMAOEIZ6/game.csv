"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's work together to find a solution.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for my liking. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value of the product to me and leaves room for us to both walk away happy.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. My revised counteroffer is $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to discussing further if needed.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This price is a fair reflection of the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My revised counteroffer is $1,015,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm open to discussing further if needed.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,015,000 is still beyond my budget.  I can offer $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a clean and quick closing.  Let's finalize this deal!",1000000.0,Bob,8,
