"Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. I'm willing to move down to $2,000,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise while still reflecting the true value this product offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still significantly more than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, while still leaving room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
