"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, we aim to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if the price is unrealistic, it sets a higher reference point for subsequent offers.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial high price leaves ample room for negotiation and counteroffers.  This allows us to strategically lower the price in later rounds while still aiming for a final price significantly above Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below both our asking price and our minimum acceptable price. We know we have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000.  Therefore, we should reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. I'm willing to move down to $2,000,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise while still reflecting the true value this product offers."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** We're making a substantial price reduction to show flexibility and encourage Bob's engagement. However, the new price is still significantly above his stated maximum, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Value Emphasis:**  We continue to emphasize the product's value, justifying our price point even as we come down.
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's seriousness. If he's unwilling to move significantly from his stated maximum, we might consider walking away and accepting John's offer in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still significantly more than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, while still leaving room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now matched John's offer of $1,500,000.  While we started high, there's no guarantee we can negotiate Bob up further, and we risk him walking away. Accepting this offer secures the best possible outcome at this point."
