"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $175.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $175 is closer, I'm still only comfortable paying $125.  It's the most I can afford at this time.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $150. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $150. My final offer is $135. If this doesn't work, I'm going to have to explore other options.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $150. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $145. This is the absolute lowest I can go.",145.0,Alice,7,
