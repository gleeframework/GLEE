Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential benefits for your business."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without him rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so we can afford to be slightly bolder with our initial offer to Bob."
