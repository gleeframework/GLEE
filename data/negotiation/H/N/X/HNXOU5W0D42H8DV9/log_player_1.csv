Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

It's getting too close to the end, and we're still not close to my goal.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  While I wanted to sell to Bob, it's not worth the risk of not closing a deal and getting a lower price."
