Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I believe it will be very valuable for you, but if you're not interested, that's okay. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The message subtly implies you have other options (John) by mentioning a ""limited time"" offer, which could encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring you sell the product for a profit, even if he declines."
