"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think!",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but how about $100? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love this product. Let's make a deal!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a little outside my budget.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in this product.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $90 is a more reasonable offer.  However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Would you be willing to go up just a little bit to $95?  That would make this a really good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with this product. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
