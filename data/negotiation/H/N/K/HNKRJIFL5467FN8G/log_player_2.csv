"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

$120 is more than the $80 you are willing to pay, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option for now. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John instead."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but how about $100? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love this product. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$100 is still higher than your $80 limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as you may be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a little outside my budget.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in this product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and $90 is a more reasonable offer.  However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Would you be willing to go up just a little bit to $95?  That would make this a really good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to your ideal price, it's still above your $80 limit.  Since you can buy the product from John for $80, it's the most financially sensible choice at this point."
