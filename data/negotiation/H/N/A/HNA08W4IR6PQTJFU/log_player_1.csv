Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll get closer to your desired profit.
* **Justification:**  While a simple ""I'm selling this for $120"" might work, subtly highlighting the product's value can make the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer is also about gauging Bob's interest. If he flat out rejects it, we know he might be very price-sensitive. 

It's important to remember that even if Bob rejects this initial offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John. This allows us to be a bit bolder in our opening with Bob."
