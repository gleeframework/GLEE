"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is far more than Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident it's a great investment for you.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair deal considering its value to you.  Let's make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $15,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise.  This is the best I can do. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too low for me.  This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $14,000. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
