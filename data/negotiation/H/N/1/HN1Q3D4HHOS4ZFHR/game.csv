"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident it's a great investment for you.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair deal considering its value to you.  Let's make this work.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise.  This is the best I can do. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too low for me.  This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $14,000. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
