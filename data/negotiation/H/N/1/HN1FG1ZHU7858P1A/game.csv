"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that being said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11,000 for the product.  It's a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still a decent profit for you.  Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I'm still not quite comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know what you think!",11250.0,Alice,5,
