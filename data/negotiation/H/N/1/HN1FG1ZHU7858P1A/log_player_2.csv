"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that being said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $10,000.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer.  He's also got the option of buying from John for $10,000, which is his absolute maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11,000 for the product.  It's a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still a decent profit for you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I'm still not quite comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $10,000.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, there are only 5 rounds left.  It's likely that the price will not come down to $10,000 in this time frame.  Additionally, Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000, which is the best possible deal.  Therefore, Bob should choose to buy from John."
