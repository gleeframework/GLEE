{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum. It's worth negotiating further to see if a lower price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's offer. This is a tactic to test Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially push her towards a lower price. The offer is still within Bob's budget, giving him room to potentially increase it if necessary."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's target price. However, it is lower than her previous offer. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering the offer from John. The goal is to see if Alice is willing to come down further, as she has already shown some flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above Bob's target price.  He's already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and has room to increase his offer again without exceeding his budget.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price before potentially switching to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer again, but this time by a smaller amount. This shows that he's getting closer to his limit but is still willing to compromise. It's a calculated risk, but it could push Alice to accept before she risks losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now just slightly above Bob's maximum budget.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, and Bob may end up buying from John.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the purchase within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
