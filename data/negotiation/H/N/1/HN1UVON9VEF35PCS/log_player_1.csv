Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counteroffer without you feeling pressured to accept a significantly lower price.
* **It reflects the value to Bob:** $95 is still less than the $100 value Bob places on the product, giving him an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still lower than your initial offer and leaves room for you to potentially get a better price. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between your initial offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85.
* **Still profitable:** This price is still above your minimum of $80 and offers you a decent profit.
* **Incentivizes Bob:**  $90 is still lower than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him a reason to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87 is still below your initial desired price, it's a reasonable compromise. Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Slightly better than John:** Selling to Bob for $87 is $7 more than selling to John. This additional profit is worth considering.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even though you're accepting, Bob may be open to going higher in the future.  You've already shown you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, potentially leading to a stalemate or a lower price if Bob becomes more firm. 

Accepting Bob's offer strikes a balance between potential future gain and immediate profit."
