"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and quality.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,000,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I hope we can both agree on.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
