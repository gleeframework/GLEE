Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I am going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum price of $12,000. I still have 8 rounds left and can try to negotiate a better price with Bob.  It's worth trying to get closer to my target value before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my best offer - I'm not sure I can go lower. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering your willingness to come down to $9,000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I believe I can do better, and it's worth exploring the possibility of a higher offer from Bob. I have 6 rounds left and I'm not desperate to sell yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,500.  However, I'm still closer to $9,000.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $8,750. This is a good price for both of us. Let's make this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
