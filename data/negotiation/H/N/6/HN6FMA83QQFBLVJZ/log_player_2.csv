"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, and you know John will sell for $120, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately. Rejecting and counteroffering gives you the chance to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and hopefully sparks a discussion towards a more favorable price for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is lower than John's price and within my budget.  Since I only have 10 rounds, it's a good idea to accept a reasonable offer to avoid potentially losing out on a good deal with John."
