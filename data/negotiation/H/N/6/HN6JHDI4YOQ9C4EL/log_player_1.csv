Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, securing a deal with Bob at a slightly lower price could still yield a substantial profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,190,000 positions it just below our guaranteed sale price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is our initial offer, the message implies we're open to discussing the price further, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
