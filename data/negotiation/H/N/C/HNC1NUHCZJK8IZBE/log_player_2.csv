# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

You can get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is less than Alice's offer. It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
