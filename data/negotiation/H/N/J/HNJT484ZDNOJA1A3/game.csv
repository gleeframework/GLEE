"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique nature of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be open to a price of $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $850,000? I'm eager to make this deal work.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle right between our last two offers at $875,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $875,000 is a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll offer it to you for $920,000. This is the last concession I'm willing to make, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to bump up the offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $880,000. I'll offer it to you for $915,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,9,
