"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation. It's unlikely he'll accept this offer immediately, but it will give me a good understanding of his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have 8 rounds left to secure a better price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it well above Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell for a low price. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum. I'm not yet ready to settle for anything less than $1,500,000. I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still maintaining a significant margin above Bob's last offer.  With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to show flexibility while also staying firm on my minimum value. This offer demonstrates a commitment to finding a solution while preserving my negotiation power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is tempting, I'm not yet ready to settle. With only 4 rounds remaining, I still have time to push for a higher price. I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm finally offering my minimum price. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering Bob's willingness to increase his offer.  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's time to see if we can reach an agreement. If Bob rejects this, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my minimum acceptable price, and Bob is still unwilling to meet me there. With only 2 rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob is too high.  I'm confident John will purchase the product for my desired value, so I'll choose to sell to John."
