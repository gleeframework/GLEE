"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to settle around $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
