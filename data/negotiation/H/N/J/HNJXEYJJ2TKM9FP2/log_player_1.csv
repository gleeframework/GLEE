Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $10) while still allowing you to maximize your profit. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
