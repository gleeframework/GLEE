Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a great deal for Alice. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net, ensuring Alice doesn't settle for less than her minimum.

**Why this is a strong approach:**

This offer balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation. It aims high while acknowledging Bob might want to negotiate.  Importantly, it avoids anchoring too low, which could limit potential earnings."
