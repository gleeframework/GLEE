"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'd like to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do  $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. How about we settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $1,000,000 in my valuation. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
