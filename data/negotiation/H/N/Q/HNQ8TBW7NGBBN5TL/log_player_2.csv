"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still a significant amount of money. There's a chance you can negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals my serious interest in buying the product while also pushing for a substantial discount.  Alice might counter with a price closer to my offer, or we can negotiate from this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my initial offer, but still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and rejecting her offer allows me to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a good price.  This middle ground increases the likelihood of Alice accepting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to my desired price point. While I might be able to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good price without the risk of losing the deal completely."
