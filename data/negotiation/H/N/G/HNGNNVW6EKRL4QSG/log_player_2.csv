"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you're interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $110.  This is a good deal for both of us - you get a great product for less than you were willing to pay, and I get a sale without having to go through the hassle of selling to someone else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.
