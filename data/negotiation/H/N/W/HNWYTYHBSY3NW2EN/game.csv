"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Let me see what I can do. I can offer you a compromise at $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high. My maximum budget is $12,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $12,500? ",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go up to $12,500. Let me think for a moment... How about I meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500? I can offer you $12,750. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get the best price for your product, but $12,750 is just outside my budget. I'm happy to go up to $12,250.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the highest I can go. What do you say? ",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $12,250. Let me think... I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $12,800? It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the value of the product.",12800.0,Alice,7,
