"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $11,000? This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
