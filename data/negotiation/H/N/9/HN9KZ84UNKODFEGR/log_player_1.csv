I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll start with a counteroffer closer to my desired price."

I'm going to sell the product to John. Even though I'm getting closer to my minimum price with Bob, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal completely. John is offering my minimum price, and I can't afford to risk going lower."
