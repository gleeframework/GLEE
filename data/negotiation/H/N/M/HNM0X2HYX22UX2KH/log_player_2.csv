# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good starting point,  Bob can likely get a better deal.  He should try to negotiate further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It demonstrates Bob's serious interest in buying the product while pushing for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, he can still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to his target. This counteroffer  is a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you seem very set on this product.  I understand budget is important, so I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his target price. Although Alice is stating it's her final offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's possible to push for a slightly lower price, potentially getting closer to $10,750. This is better than buying from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,900 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference at $10,800.  This is my final offer, I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 10800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of incremental increases. This offer is a reasonable compromise that is in the middle of his previous offer and Alice's last offer.  He's also stating it's his final offer, hoping to push Alice towards accepting. This is a good strategy, as it shows he's serious about the deal while leaving just a small window for further negotiation."
