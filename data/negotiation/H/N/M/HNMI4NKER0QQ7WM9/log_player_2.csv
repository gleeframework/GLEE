# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
