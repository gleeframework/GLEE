,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a little higher than I want to be. How about we split the difference and I pay $125? That seems fair to us both.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $135. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $135. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",135.0,Alice,5,
