"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:**  $13,500 is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer, and significantly less than John's price.
* **Opportunity cost:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but also risks Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffer or wasting time.  There's a chance Alice won't go lower, and Bob could end up paying more than $13,500.
* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so even at $13,500, Bob is still getting a good deal."
