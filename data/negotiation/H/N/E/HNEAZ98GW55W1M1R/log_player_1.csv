Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. My asking price is $175. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and sets the stage for negotiation.  It acknowledges Bob's interest and presents the price as ""fair"" based on the product's value. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Get Bob thinking:** He knows the product is worth $100 to him, but I'm offering it for more. This sparks his interest in negotiating.
* **Set a high starting point:**  I want to maximize my potential earnings.
* **Leave room for compromise:** A $175 price leaves space for me to lower the price if necessary without dropping below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me. Therefore, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and my own costs, I'm willing to come down to $130. This would still allow for a reasonable profit for me and hopefully remains attractive to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $130.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and acknowledges Bob's desire for a good deal. It also justifies my price by mentioning the value of the product and my own costs. 
* **Room for compromise:** The counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, without going below my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating a willingness to compromise shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $130 still ensures that I will profit from the sale.
* **Encourage further negotiation:**  I'm hoping that Bob sees $130 as a more reasonable price and is willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still only able to offer $110 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to make a profit.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  it's clear that Bob is not willing to come up to my price.  To avoid further negotiation that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome,  I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and guarantees me a profit."
