"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and my own costs, I'm willing to come down to $130. This would still allow for a reasonable profit for me and hopefully remains attractive to you.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still only able to offer $110 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to make a profit.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
