"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,350,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and your willingness to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,300,000. This would be a fair deal, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really serious about this deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is the closest she's come to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. There's a risk that further negotiation will lead to a stalemate, and Bob might not be able to get a price lower than $1,320,000. Therefore, it's more efficient and safer to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, ensuring Bob saves as much money as possible."
