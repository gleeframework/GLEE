{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's a little less than the maximum Bob would pay but still allows me to make a good profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if he's interested in a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm willing to see if I can get a little closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  $130 is a good price, but I'm hoping for a bit more. How about $135? That would still be a great deal for you, and I would be able to sell it for a fair price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and it's definitely better than selling to John for $120.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $132.50."
