"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Alice,5,
