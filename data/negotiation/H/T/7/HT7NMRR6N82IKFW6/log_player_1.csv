"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's potential for a higher price.  I'll see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially close the deal at a more favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counteroffer in the next round. I'm still confident that I can get a better price than $700,000.  While I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, I believe I can potentially get closer to my initial asking price if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It also keeps the negotiation alive and shows Bob I'm willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already compromised twice, and it seems like he's not willing to meet me halfway.  Rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. This guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further risk of a bad deal with Bob."
