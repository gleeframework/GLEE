Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. My counteroffer is $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another concession. My counteroffer is $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000. You can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, saving you $50,000.  There's little point in continuing negotiations with Alice when you have a guaranteed better deal elsewhere."
