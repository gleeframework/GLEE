{

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving down, and we are still well above John's offer. It's time to show more firmness and push back harder to see if Bob is willing to come up in price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,225,000, which would be $1,187,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob finally moved up in price and made a compromise by meeting in the middle. While it's not the $1,225,000 we aimed for, $1,187,500 is a strong offer and significantly higher than John's standing offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer again in the last two rounds."
