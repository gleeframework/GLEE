Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find quite valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 allows for potential negotiation downwards while staying above your minimum price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $80 ensures you won't lose out completely if Bob declines."
