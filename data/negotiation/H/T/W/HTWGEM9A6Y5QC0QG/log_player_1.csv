"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $115, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer, and for me to potentially adjust my price down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even below the product's worth to Bob ($100). Accepting it would be a loss.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows his interest.  Rejecting it allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially find a price we both agree on. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If the negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for $120, ensuring I meet my minimum profit requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to negotiate, but I can't go lower than $105. Would you be willing to consider that?  We're both close to a deal here."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within reason:**  $105 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone to encourage further negotiation.
* **Highlighting closeness:**  By saying ""we're both close to a deal,"" I aim to make Bob feel like a little more compromise will lead to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $97.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's closer, it's not a deal I'm willing to accept.
* **Continued negotiation:**  Bob is showing a willingness to meet in the middle, suggesting further negotiation might lead to a more acceptable price.  
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If this negotiation fails, selling to John for $120 ensures I get my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. $97.50 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (almost):** I'm meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer ($105) and his offer ($97.50). This shows good faith and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize that $100 is a ""fair price for both of us"" and that Bob will be ""happy with the product."" This subtly reminds him of the product's worth.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm pushing for a final agreement with a ""what do you say?"" closing, encouraging Bob to accept."
