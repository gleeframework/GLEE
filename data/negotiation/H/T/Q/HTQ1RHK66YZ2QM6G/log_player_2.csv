"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100, but let me know if you're interested and we can discuss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's initial offer of $100 is above your maximum budget of $80. 
* You know you can get the product for $80 from John. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding to buy from John."
