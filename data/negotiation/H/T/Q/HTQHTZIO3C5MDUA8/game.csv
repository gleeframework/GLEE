"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time. How about we meet closer to the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $19,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $17,500 for it. Can we meet in the middle again?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your interest, but I need to be closer to $18,500 for this to make sense for me.  Would you be willing to come up to that?",18500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a fair price.  $17,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. To be honest, I have another offer for $15,000.  To avoid going with that, I'd need you to come up to at least $18,000. This is my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,7,
