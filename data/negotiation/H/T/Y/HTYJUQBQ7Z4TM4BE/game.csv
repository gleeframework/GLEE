"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $82. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",82.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  However, I'm sticking to my budget. Would you consider $78? That's the most I can offer.",78.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $78 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $87. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",87.0,Alice,7,
