"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $90 is better than $100 (John's price), you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's a range for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **The goal is to save money:**  By rejecting, you open the door to a potential lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to come down to $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $87.50. It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your target:**  You're aiming for $85 or less, and Alice's offer is still $2.50 higher. 
* **There's still room to negotiate:** Alice is willing to compromise, which means there's still potential to get a better price.
* **You're close:** You've already gotten Alice to lower her price considerably.  A counteroffer could push her closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I can offer you the product for $88. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is close to your target:**  $88 is only $1 away from your ideal price of $87.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings:**  Alice has already made concessions, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **John's price is higher:**  Buying from John for $100 is a worse option than accepting Alice's final offer.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's, and only slightly higher than your target.  It's a good compromise that secures the purchase."
