It's always a good idea to start by exploring if you can get a better price.  You have a good starting point at $12,000. Let's see if we can get it lower."

Let's start with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is a considerable drop from her initial offer, but it's still within your budget."

Alice is coming down in price, which is a good sign.  Let's try to meet in the middle with our next counteroffer."

Round 4

We're getting close!  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $11,200 is a good deal for us.  Accepting her offer means we save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
