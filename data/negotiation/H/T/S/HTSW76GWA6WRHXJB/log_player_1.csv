"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, and I'm excited about the possibility of working with you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I'm still aiming for a higher price, given the product's value to Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'll counteroffer with a price slightly above his offer and see if we can reach a compromise. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still room for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my bottom line, but I'm still not willing to sell for $1,100,000.  I'm going to counteroffer with a price slightly higher than his offer and see if we can reach an agreement.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still a good chance of reaching a deal with Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is approaching John's offer, I'm still not willing to sell for $1,075,000. It's important to remember the value of the product to Bob. I'll make one last counteroffer before considering selling to John. I believe there's still a chance to secure a better deal with Bob."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but Bob's final offer of $1,050,000 is too low.  While it's tempting to try and squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal completely and getting only $1,000,000 from John is too high.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John at this point."
