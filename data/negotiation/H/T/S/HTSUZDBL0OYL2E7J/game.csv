"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is substantial.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $1,050,000. I'm confident that this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000.  Would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
