"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'll gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. I need to see if I can negotiate a better price. I'm willing to risk going another round to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,250,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round to see if we can reach a deal.  I believe I can still get a better price than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to stick with a counteroffer that's still above what John is offering, but a bit lower than my previous offer.  It's getting close to where I would accept, but I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round to see if we can reach a deal.  I believe I can still get a better price than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $1,050,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I think it's within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay. With only a few rounds left, I need to be more aggressive but still leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation.  While I'm still hoping for a higher price,  Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also running out of time.  It's a better option to accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially ending with a lower price or a sale to John, which would net me the same amount."
