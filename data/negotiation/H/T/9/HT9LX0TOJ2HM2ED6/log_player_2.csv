"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save $1,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  While there's a risk Alice might not accept, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value, which is $8,000. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  This shows Bob is serious about buying the product while still attempting to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's initial offer, it's still not ideal. Bob can try to negotiate further and see if he can get a lower price. The risk of Alice not accepting is present, but Bob is willing to take it to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise but still wants a better deal. This offer is closer to the midpoint between his initial offer and Alice's latest counteroffer, potentially making it more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to the $10,000 price Bob is willing to pay from John. Further negotiation might get a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the offer is growing. It's now more strategic for Bob to buy from John and avoid the potential of further negotiation leading to a worse outcome."
