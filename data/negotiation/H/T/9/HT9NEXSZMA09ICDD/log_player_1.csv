Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  However, I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield greater profit.
* **High but Negotiable:**  $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, signaling to Bob that a mutually beneficial deal might be possible.

This strategy allows us to:

1. **Test Bob's willingness:** See if he's willing to pay close to our minimum acceptable price.
2. **Potentially secure a higher profit:** If Bob accepts or negotiates down only slightly, we earn more than selling directly to John.
3. **Maintain the safety net:** If Bob rejects the offer, we can confidently sell to John at our desired price."
