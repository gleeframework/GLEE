# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further if needed.
