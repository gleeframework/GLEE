Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of your product, $900,000 is above my current budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.
