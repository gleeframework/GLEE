"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of your product, $900,000 is above my current budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move forward, we propose a price of $850,000 for the product.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to offer $825,000.  This is a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product to me while giving you a solid return on your investment. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
