"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This reflects its value to me and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to budge closer to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her first one, it's still higher than your ideal price.  You have several rounds left and a backup option (John) who's selling for your target price.  Continuing to negotiate will likely result in a better deal for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, which is a fair compromise. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further step towards Alice's price, showing that you are willing to negotiate. However, it is still below her current offer, creating room for further negotiation.  This offer demonstrates your willingness to compromise while staying within your preferred price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, and I've already made a significant counteroffer that was rejected. With only five rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate any lower with Alice. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring I get the product within my budget."
