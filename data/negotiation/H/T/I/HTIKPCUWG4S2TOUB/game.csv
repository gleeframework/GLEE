"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This reflects its value to me and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, which is a fair compromise. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,5,
