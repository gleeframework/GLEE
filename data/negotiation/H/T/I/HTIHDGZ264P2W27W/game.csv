"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a great product, but I have some budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit and ensures you get a great product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm  open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about $850,000? It's a fair price that respects your budget and allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's try to close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm feeling the pressure of time here.  I'm willing to drop my price to $840,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",840000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm at my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,8,
