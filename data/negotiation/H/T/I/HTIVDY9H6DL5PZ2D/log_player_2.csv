I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11,000? This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to come down to your price.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to get you a better deal.  Buying from John at $8,000 is the best option to ensure you don't overpay."
