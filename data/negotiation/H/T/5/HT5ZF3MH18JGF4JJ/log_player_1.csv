"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A high initial offer gives me the best chance of earning a large profit.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob is truly interested in the product, he might be willing to negotiate from this high starting point.
* **Safety net:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if Bob doesn't meet my price expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to counteroffer to try and close the deal at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still leaves some room for profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:**  This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain profit margin:**  $1,400,000 is still a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Test the waters:**  If Bob accepts this offer, great! If not, I can continue to gauge his interest in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good compromise.  While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price than John's offer.  I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
