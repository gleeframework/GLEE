"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. Although it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate and try to get closer to my desired price.  I believe I can get a better offer from Bob in the following rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  While I understand your perspective, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to make this deal happen. Let's find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to meet me at $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still confident that I can get a better price from him, as he clearly values the product higher than $925,000.  We're close, and I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $925,000 still feels a bit low considering the value this product brings.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm offering $935,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 935000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm recognizing that this negotiation is becoming more difficult. Bob is sticking to his position, and there's a chance he may walk away if I continue to push. 

Accepting his offer of $920,000 is a better outcome than selling to John for $800,000. I'm confident that I can find another buyer in the future who will be willing to pay more."
