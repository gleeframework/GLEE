Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is tempting, it's getting dangerously close to John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob might only yield incremental increases at this point. There's a real chance Bob won't go much higher.
* **Time Value:** Each round represents time and effort.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk a stalemate with Bob and potentially lose both offers.
* **Guaranteed Return:** John's offer is a sure thing, guaranteeing the minimum acceptable price. 

It makes more sense to take John's guaranteed $1,500,000 rather than risk getting less from Bob after further negotiation."
