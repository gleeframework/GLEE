"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can potentially get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can lower the price further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This would give you a decent profit while still saving me some money.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, which is good. However, you still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to continue trying to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $11,500 is closer to what I want to pay, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $11,000.  I'm really hoping to finalize this deal today!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to split the difference, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $11500 and $11000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11250. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is a good price for you. You are getting the product for a significant discount compared to John's offer, and it's also within your budget.  While you might be able to negotiate a bit more, it's likely that Alice won't budge further.  It's a fair deal, and accepting it avoids the risk of her rejecting further counteroffers and potentially losing the deal altogether."
