"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This would give you a decent profit while still saving me some money.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original asking price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $11500 is closer to what I want to pay, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $11000.  I'm really hoping to finalize this deal today!",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to split the difference, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $11500 and $11000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11250. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
