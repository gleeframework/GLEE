"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe will be of great interest to you. While I can't disclose the exact details of the product just yet, I can assure you that its worth is no less than $15000. I'm confident that you'll find its value to be even higher. I'm willing to let it go for $18000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. While she claims the product is worth more, it's important to remember that:

* **You don't know the true value of the product:** Her assessment could be inflated.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:** John is offering the same product for $12,000, which is within your budget.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially sensible choice."
