"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and encouraging:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know I'm open to negotiation by asking for his thoughts. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest while starting with a price that's beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I have 10 rounds to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, but it's best to exhaust negotiation with Bob first to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that the price is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Seeking common ground:** I'm using language that suggests a willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.

By making a counteroffer that's more reasonable than my initial price but still above Bob's offer, I aim to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** $10,000 is now just $2,000 below my minimum value, and I have a decent chance of getting a higher price in future rounds. 
* **Time constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that's within my acceptable range.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll run out of rounds before reaching a better price. Accepting now guarantees a sale and a reasonable profit."
