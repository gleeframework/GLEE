Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to, increasing the chance of a sale.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Offering it for much less than $130 significantly reduces potential profit if Bob accepts. Offering it for much more increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and me having to sell to John for $150."
