"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($120). There's room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  $140 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about $130? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it then."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $140 is really a fair price for the value this product offers. I could meet you halfway at $135.  It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:**  $135 is within Bob's budget and only $15 above Alice's value. 
* **Alice's ""final offer"" statement:** This creates pressure to accept, as there's a chance Bob could miss out on the deal if he rejects.
* **Risk of going to John:** While John's price is $150, there's no guarantee that Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price with him. 

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Alice's offer at $135 is the most sensible decision in this round. Bob saves $15 compared to buying from John."
