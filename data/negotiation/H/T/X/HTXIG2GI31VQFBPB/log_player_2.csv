"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $1,200,000. This is a generous price, considering the product's value to you is only $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?
