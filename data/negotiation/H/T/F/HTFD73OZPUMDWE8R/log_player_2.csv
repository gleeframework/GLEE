"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I'm open to discussing further, but I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Bob has 10 rounds to potentially get a better deal, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get a significant discount. This strategy aims to quickly establish a lower price point and potentially push Alice to compromise.  He's still leaving room for negotiation, as he has 9 rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more reflective of that.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get a better price than $13,000.  While Alice has come down from her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation, and Bob has 8 rounds remaining to try and get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation going in Bob's favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This offer is still within my budget and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise but still pushing for a good price.  He's met Alice halfway from his previous offer, and by increasing to $12,500, he's showing he's serious about buying the product without significantly exceeding his budget. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward."
