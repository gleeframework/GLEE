Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize my potential profit while also being reasonable to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm still aiming for a profit above $80, but showing flexibility to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll counter with one last offer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm countering with $98.  This is my final offer before considering selling to John. It's a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway, but still leaving me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly stubborn and I'm not sure I can get a better price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, at least I can get a profit of $80."
