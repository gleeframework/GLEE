"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we consider $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still too high for my budget. I can do $11,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
