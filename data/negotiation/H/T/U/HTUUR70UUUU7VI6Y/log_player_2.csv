**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $895,000.  This price is a significant savings compared to John's offer and a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to push for a lower price risks stalling the negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
