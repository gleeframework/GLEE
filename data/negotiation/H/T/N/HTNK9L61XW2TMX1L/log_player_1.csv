"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the farm in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $5,000?  I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $5,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **There are more rounds.** I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob. I'm not going to give up on a better deal just yet. 
* **John is a backup:**  If things don't work out with Bob, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:** I'm coming down from my initial offer, but not by much. I'm showing flexibility but also asserting that the product has significant value.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider a higher price. 
* **Clear Offer:** I'm providing a clear counteroffer with a specific price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about meeting halfway between our last two offers at $7,000? That sounds fair to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $7,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly less than what the product is worth to me.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds left, and there's still potential to find a price that works for both of us. 
* **John is a backup:**  If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $7,000 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's split the difference again. How about $8,500? I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable, and this price reflects that."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm continuing to show willingness to compromise by meeting halfway again, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him see it's worth a higher price.
* **Clear Offer:** I'm giving a specific counteroffer, making it clear what I'm proposing."
