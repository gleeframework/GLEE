"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $5,000?  I think that's a fair price.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about meeting halfway between our last two offers at $7,000? That sounds fair to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $7,000 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's split the difference again. How about $8,500? I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable, and this price reflects that.",8500.0,Alice,5,
