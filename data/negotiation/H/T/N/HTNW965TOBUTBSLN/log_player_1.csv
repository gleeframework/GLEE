Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $10,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $9,000.  This is a great price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,900 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I still want to try to reach a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8,950. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,950.

I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob. Even though $8,950 is close to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000. It's a safer bet and ensures I get my minimum desired price."
