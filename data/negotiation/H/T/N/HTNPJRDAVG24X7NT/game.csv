"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  I think that's fair for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $125 is still more than I had in mind. Could you do $95? That would be a great price for me.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Let's get this done.",110.0,Alice,5,
