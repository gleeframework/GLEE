"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility. It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but within a reasonable range for both of us."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it. I'm holding out for a bit more, hoping to get closer to my desired price range. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $12,500. This is a further compromise, showing I'm serious about making a deal. However, it's still above Bob's last offer, and I'm hoping he will see the value of closing this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable price and getting close to the middle ground between our initial offers. With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $10,000."
