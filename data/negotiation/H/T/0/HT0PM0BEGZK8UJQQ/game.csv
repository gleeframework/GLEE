"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I have to make sure I get a good deal for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $1250000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1100000. Can you consider a slight adjustment to $1120000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1120000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've got to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about we meet in the middle of that, at $1175000?",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to be as close to your budget as possible, Bob. However, I've got to think about the value of the product and what it's worth to me. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. How about we meet exactly at $1150000?",1150000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm surprised by your counteroffer, Bob. I didn't expect you to try to flip the script like that. However, I'm not willing to accept a price that's higher than my original offer. Let's get back to the negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
