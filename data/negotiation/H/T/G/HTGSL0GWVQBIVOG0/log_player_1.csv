Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. After reviewing the product's value and market trends, I was thinking of a price around $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently staying below $1,000,000 and moving in frustratingly small increments.  While we still have rounds left, continuing the negotiation seems likely to result in a final offer far below John's guaranteed $1,200,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
