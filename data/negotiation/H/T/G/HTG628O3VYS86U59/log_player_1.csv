Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with my desired price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to nudge him towards a higher price point. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussion and negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer. If it's within my acceptable range (close to $1,000,000), I'll consider accepting.
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* If negotiations stall or Bob's offers become unreasonable, I'll move to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to guarantee my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my financial constraints.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  While $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's offer indicates a willingness to negotiate. I believe I can potentially secure a price closer to my desired amount through further negotiations. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees my desired profit, but there's a chance that by rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiation, I might be able to secure a higher price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's higher than his $850,000 but still below my initial $1,000,000. This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a more profitable deal. 
* I'll continue to assess the situation and be prepared to shift to selling to John if further negotiations with Bob prove unsuccessful."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the significant value the product brings, while still allowing for a reasonable margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Maintain Profit:**  I'm offering a price that's a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates flexibility while also aiming to maximize my profit.
* **Value and Reason:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, hoping to justify the higher price. 
* **Open-ended Message:**  The message ends with an open-ended question (""Let's see if we can reach an agreement""), encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've secured a profitable deal.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and proceed accordingly. If his counteroffer is close to $950,000, I might be willing to accept.
* If his counteroffer is still significantly below $950,000, I'll make another counteroffer or, if negotiations continue to stall, I will move to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  I'll establish a good rapport with Bob, hoping to foster a potential long-term business partnership."
