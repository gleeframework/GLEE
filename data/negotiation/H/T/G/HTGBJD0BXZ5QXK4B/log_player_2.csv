# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This price reflects the immense potential this product holds for your business.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $700,000 is still below my bottom line, I'm willing to accept $825,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. Please consider the value this product brings and let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's final offer of $825,000 is closer to your budget, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $800,000. You're better off securing the product from John at a lower price, maximizing your savings."
