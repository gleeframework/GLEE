Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1200000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $1200000 to me. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm happy with the $1,200,000, I believe I can get a better price. I have 9 rounds left and I can always sell to John if things don't work out with Bob.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more profit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're keen on the $1,200,000 price, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. That's a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're still holding out for a bit more, but I'm not willing to go above $1250000. I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to $1,400,000,  $1,250,000 is still a good profit. We're halfway through the rounds, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer.  It's better to take a good deal than risk getting nothing at all."
