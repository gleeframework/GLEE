"Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in your product but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This is still a great price for a product of this quality. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and I pay $11000?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11500.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
