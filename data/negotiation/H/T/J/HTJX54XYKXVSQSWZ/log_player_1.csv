Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique chance to acquire it before I explore other offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit beyond your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,100,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still represents a substantial discount compared to what John is willing to pay.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other offers,"" you introduce a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider the deal seriously without completely revealing your fallback option."
