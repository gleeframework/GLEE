"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is well below your maximum price of $12,000. There's room for negotiation and you can likely secure a better price.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go higher before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $7000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're hoping to pay.  Since you have rounds left and John is always an option, it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get Alice closer to your $7,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8200, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer.  I'm willing to go to $7500, which is still a good price for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still trying to get closer to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still a bit higher than you'd like to pay.  You have a few rounds left, and John is still a backup option, so it makes sense to keep trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get to $7,800.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 7800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still trying to get to $7800, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $8050. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,050 is now very close to your target price of $7,800.  You've only got three rounds left, and while you might be able to squeeze out a tiny bit more, it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer will save you a significant amount compared to buying from John."
