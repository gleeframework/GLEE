"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a lower price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $125 is still a little low for me. How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $135 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're willing to come down, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to close the deal right now if you're willing to go down to $130."", ""product_price"": 130}
