"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $600,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to offer you $550,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $650,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $600,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering we're both meeting in the middle.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the true value of the product to you. I'll offer it to you for $620,000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",620000.0,Alice,5,
