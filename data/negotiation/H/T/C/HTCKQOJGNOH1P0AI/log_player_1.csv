``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not going to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this price is fair and represents a good value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I still want to see if I can get a little more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this price is fair and represents a good value for Bob.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal with Bob."
