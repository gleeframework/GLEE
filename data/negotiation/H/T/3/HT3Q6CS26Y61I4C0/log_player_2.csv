"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a good price, it's still above your desired maximum of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm  prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price you're proposing is quite a bit below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle somewhat? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my target of $1,000,000.  I can try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my limit.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows for continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, as it's closer to our respective targets. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,150,000 is closer to a workable figure, it's still a significant gap from what I need to make this worthwhile.  My final offer is $1,200,000.  This offer represents the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,200,000 is still above my desired maximum of $1,000,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's likely that Alice is firm on this price.  Since I have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000, it's more beneficial to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
