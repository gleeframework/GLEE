"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm open to negotiations. However, I need to make a fair profit, so I'm starting with a price of $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This still gives you a good profit and lets me stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I can offer you a compromise at $10,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $10,250 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $9,750, which is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can offer you a price of $10,000, but I need to emphasize that this is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
