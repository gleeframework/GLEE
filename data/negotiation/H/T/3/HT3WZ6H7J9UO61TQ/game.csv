"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $170? This would still allow me to make a decent profit while also being fair to you.",170.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $170 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $170, so how about $145?",145.0,Bob,4,
