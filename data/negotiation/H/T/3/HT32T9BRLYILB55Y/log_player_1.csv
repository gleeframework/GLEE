Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Enthusiasm:** I express confidence in the product's value to create a sense of urgency and potentially increase Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I end with a question to invite Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially make a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects the initial offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we start at $7500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that significantly undervalues the product. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This reflects the value of the product and still allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counteroffer is $8,500, which is still above my minimum threshold of $8,000 but lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while protecting my interests.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage further negotiation. 

This strategy aims to meet Bob's counteroffer halfway while ensuring I receive a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $8500 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's do $8000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable value. While I could potentially keep negotiating and try to get a higher price, the risk of further rejection is high. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids potential further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a lost deal."
