"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we start at $7500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $7500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8500. This reflects the value of the product and still allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $8500 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's do $8000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
