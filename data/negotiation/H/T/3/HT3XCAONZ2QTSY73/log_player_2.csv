"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $12,000 from Alice.  It's worth $8,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Offer:**  This offer is in the middle of Alice's offer ($12,000) and your maximum price ($15,000). This is a fair starting point for negotiation.
* **Alice's Perspective:** Alice will likely be motivated to accept this offer.  She's making a profit of $2,000, which is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.
* **Your Perspective:** This offer saves you $5,000 compared to John's price, and you have room to potentially negotiate further if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Higher:** Alice's offer is only $500 higher than your counteroffer.
* **Better than John:**  This is still $2,500 cheaper than buying from John. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting and you having to buy from John at a much higher price is too high."
