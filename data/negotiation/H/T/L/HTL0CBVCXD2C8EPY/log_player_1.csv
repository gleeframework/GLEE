"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **High Opening Offer:** Starting high sets the tone for a profitable negotiation.  
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $1,500,000 is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is genuinely interested. 

**Strategy:**

I aim to understand Bob's perceived value of the product and maximize my profit within the 10 rounds. I'll assess his responses to my offer and counteroffers to gauge his willingness to pay.  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob proves unwilling to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** While I'm willing to negotiate, I cannot accept such a drastic drop in price. 
* **I have multiple rounds remaining.**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue exploring a more favorable price without losing the opportunity to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground that both parties can accept.  I'll also closely monitor Bob's responses to assess his seriousness and willingness to meet my expectations. If negotiations stall or I sense Bob is not genuinely interested, I will sell to John to secure my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  This offer is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, it still sits comfortably above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  By lowering my price, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm open to reaching a deal. I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and his counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to understand Bob's range of acceptable prices. If he accepts this offer, I've achieved a good result. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I will continue to evaluate the potential of a deal with Bob compared to selling to John at the minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Closing in on a Deal:** Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range, approaching my desired price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, I'm nearing the middle of our negotiations.  Further rejections could lead to a stalemate or a loss of time, risking the sale to John. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting this offer secures a sale above my minimum acceptable price and reduces the risk of a more unfavorable outcome. 

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a calculated risk by accepting this offer. I've gauged that Bob is likely to be my best option at this point. While I'm not getting my ideal price, I'm securing a sale with minimal risk. I've considered the potential of further negotiations, but I believe the current offer represents a good balance of price and certainty."
