"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your starting price. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I see more potential to close a deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.
