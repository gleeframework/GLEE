Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, knowing that Bob values the product less.  While it's unlikely he'll accept immediately, it sets a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject it. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a compromise, but still closer to my ideal price than Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see the value in a deal closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, his offer of $9,250 is getting too close to my minimum.  Selling to John for $10,000 ensures I get my desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially lowering the price even more."
