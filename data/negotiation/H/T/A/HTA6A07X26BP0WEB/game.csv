"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's still a significant discount from the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $950,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $925,000? It's a fair price that I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
