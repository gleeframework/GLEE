{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you are willing to be flexible.  This approach allows for a potential win-win situation where you get a price closer to your minimum and Bob still gets a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's still a significant discount from the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $950,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $925,000? It's a fair price that I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $925,000 is a fair compromise. It's close enough to my desired price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely. It's also a good opportunity to secure a sale, as Bob seems willing to close at this price."
