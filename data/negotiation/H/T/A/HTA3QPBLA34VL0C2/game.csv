"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $2,200,000 is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident $1,000,000 is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's work towards a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,000,000 is a significant jump, to be transparent, I do have a hard minimum I need to reach for this deal to make sense on my end.  I'd be willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe that's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I'm getting closer to my target, $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I've been giving this offer a lot of thought, and to be completely candid, $1,500,000 is the lowest I can go. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value exceeding that price, making this a worthwhile investment.  ",1500000.0,Alice,7,
