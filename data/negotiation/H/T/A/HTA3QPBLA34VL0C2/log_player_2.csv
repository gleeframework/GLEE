{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth rejecting and starting a counteroffer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $2,200,000 is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident $1,000,000 is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,000,000 is a significant jump, to be transparent, I do have a hard minimum I need to reach for this deal to make sense on my end.  I'd be willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe that's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's getting closer. We should keep negotiating."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I'm getting closer to my target, $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I've been giving this offer a lot of thought, and to be completely candid, $1,500,000 is the lowest I can go. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value exceeding that price, making this a worthwhile investment.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  Since I'm limited to $800,000,  buying from John is the best choice to get the product."
