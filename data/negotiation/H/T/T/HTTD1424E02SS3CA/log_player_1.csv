Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying in a profitable range. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives you leverage. You don't need to desperately lowball the price to Bob."
