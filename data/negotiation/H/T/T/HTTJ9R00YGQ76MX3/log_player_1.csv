This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to bargain. It also leaves room for me to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. However, I will reject the offer and proceed with a counteroffer, as there is still potential for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit too far from $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,325,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John at a lower price."
