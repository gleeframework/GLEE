Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, still keeping me well above my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob."
