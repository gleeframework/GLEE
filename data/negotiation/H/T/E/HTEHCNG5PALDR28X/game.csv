"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $25000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $14000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $14000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the value I was initially thinking. I'm willing to offer it to you for $19000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",19000.0,Alice,5,
