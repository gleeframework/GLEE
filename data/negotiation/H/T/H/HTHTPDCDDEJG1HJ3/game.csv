"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1225000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1100000.  Let's see if we can find common ground at that price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
