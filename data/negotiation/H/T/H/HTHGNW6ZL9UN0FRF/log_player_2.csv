"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000).  While Alice claims it's fair, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get the price down further. There's still room for compromise, as Alice has already shown some willingness to negotiate."

Alice has lowered her price again, but $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget. While the offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still worth continuing negotiations to try and secure a better deal. There's still potential to bring the price down further."
