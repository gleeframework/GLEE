"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value and uniqueness of the product, but my budget allows me to only consider offers within the range of $500000 to $1000000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $750000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1250000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. However, based on my budget, I am unable to go beyond $900000. I would like to propose an offer of $900000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable accepting $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1100000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
