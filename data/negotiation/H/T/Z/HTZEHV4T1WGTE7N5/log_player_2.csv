# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth significantly more than $1200000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a price that reflects the value I place on it, and I'm confident you'll see the potential benefits. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. What do you think?
