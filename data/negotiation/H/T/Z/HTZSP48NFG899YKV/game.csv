"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to own something truly special.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not quite ready to pay that price. I've done some research, and I believe a fair price for this product would be $700,000. I'm willing to pay that and close the deal today.  Let's see if we can make this work.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. This would be a win-win situation, allowing you to still make a good profit and me to get a great deal.  Let's work together to find a solution.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $800,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
