Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not quite ready to pay that price. I've done some research, and I believe a fair price for this product would be $700,000. I'm willing to pay that and close the deal today.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. This would be a win-win situation, allowing you to still make a good profit and me to get a great deal.  Let's work together to find a solution.
