"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price.  He should try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  That's still a good deal for you, as you value it at $8,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already saved $1,250 from his initial target price of $10,000. Further negotiation might save him more, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John at a higher price."
