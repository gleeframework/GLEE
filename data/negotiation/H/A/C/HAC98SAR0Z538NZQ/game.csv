"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  That's still a good deal for you, as you value it at $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
