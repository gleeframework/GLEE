Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and close the deal quickly,  $850,000 is far too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum. This product is worth a lot more than you're offering, and I believe it will bring you significant value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
