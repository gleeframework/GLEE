Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $140 is above your minimum price of $120, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and reach a price you're both happy with. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  Starting high allows you to potentially secure a price closer to your ideal outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130? It's still a good price for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still profitable:** $130 is above your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a chance that further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a stalemate, potentially forcing you to sell to John for $120.
* **Time and effort:** Accepting Bob's offer saves time and effort compared to continuing negotiations.

While $140 would have been ideal, securing a profit of $10 is a good outcome, especially considering the potential downsides of further negotiation."
