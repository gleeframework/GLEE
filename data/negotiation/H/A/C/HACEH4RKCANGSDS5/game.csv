"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you as well.  I'm starting with an offer of $1500000.  This is a price that reflects the product's true potential. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1500000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. While $1000000 is certainly a significant sum, it doesn't fully reflect the potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the product's true worth.  Let's meet in the middle at $1250000. This offer gives us both a fair return on our investment.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1062500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but unfortunately, $1062500 still falls short of what this product is truly worth to me. However, I'm eager to close this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer a final price of $1150000. This is my best offer, and I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial outcome. Let's make this happen.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm not willing to pay more than $1062500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
