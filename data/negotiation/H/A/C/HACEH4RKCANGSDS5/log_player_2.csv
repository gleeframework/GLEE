# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you as well.  I'm starting with an offer of $1500000.  This is a price that reflects the product's true potential. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. While $1000000 is certainly a significant sum, it doesn't fully reflect the potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the product's true worth.  Let's meet in the middle at $1250000. This offer gives us both a fair return on our investment.  What do you think?
