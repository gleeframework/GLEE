Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. I believe this price point reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $1,000,000 is still pushing my budget.  Could we potentially agree on $750,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price, but $750,000 is still too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This offer takes into account your interest while recognizing the product's real value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to our desired price range, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $875,000 would be jumping too quickly when we might be able to get a price closer to $800,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $875,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. To be honest, my absolute limit is $800,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
