You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $150 from John, and Alice's offer is $140. You can definitely do better by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $120, which is significantly lower than Alice's $140 offer, but still higher than her $100 value. This leaves room for negotiation but also signals my seriousness in wanting the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is now lower than John's offer of $150. It's still above my ideal price, but it's the best deal I can get without risking losing the product entirely."
