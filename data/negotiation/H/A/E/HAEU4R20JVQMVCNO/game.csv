"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given its value to you, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $1,000,000,  which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
