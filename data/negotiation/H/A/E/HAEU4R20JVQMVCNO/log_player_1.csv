``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, but I'm prepared to negotiate. I've factored in that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and I'm aiming for a higher price, leaving room for potential counteroffers. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given its value to you, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if we can reach a more favorable price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000.  However, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $1,000,000,  which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is acceptable.  It's the same price I could get from John, and it saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
