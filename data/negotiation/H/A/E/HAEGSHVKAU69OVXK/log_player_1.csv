Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **My minimum value:** I value the product at $10,000.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John who will pay $10,000.

By offering $11,500, I am:

* **Maximizing my profit:** I am earning $1,500 more than my minimum value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob still has a potential $500 gain if he accepts the offer.
* **Minimizing risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum value. 

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
