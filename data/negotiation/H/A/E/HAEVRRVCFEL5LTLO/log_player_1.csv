{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair profit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit. I'll reject and see if I can get closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying my best to make this work, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could you do $105? That's a firm offer from me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is close to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to make. I'll reject and see if I can push for a bit more. There's still time to get a better deal before resorting to selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your limits, but $105 doesn't quite work for me. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to go down to $115.  This is a final offer from my end. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 115}
