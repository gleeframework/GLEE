"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair profit. Let's see if we can make this work.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be satisfied with the product. Let's close this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying my best to make this work, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could you do $105? That's a firm offer from me.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your limits, but $105 doesn't quite work for me. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to go down to $115.  This is a final offer from my end. Let me know if you're interested.",115.0,Alice,7,
