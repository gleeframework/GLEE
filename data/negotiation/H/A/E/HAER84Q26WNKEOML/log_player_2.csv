Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this and offering a starting point.  I've done extensive market analysis on this product and its potential, and to be honest, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the full scope of its value.  I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I need to see a more serious commitment from your side.  How about we consider $2,000,000?  This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what's on the table.
