"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the product's value to me, but significantly less than its value to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely Bob will accept in the first round.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and optimistic tone helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at the absolute highest price, which allows for potential counteroffers and ultimately a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really like the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Profit:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  This means there's still room for me to make a profit. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially get a higher price. 
* **Not Selling to John Yet:** John's offer is my safety net, but I'm not in a rush to sell to him. I believe I can get a better price from Bob with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about we split the difference at $95?  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Clear Counteroffer:** I'm stating my price clearly and directly, leaving no room for ambiguity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for More:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. Selling for $85 is better than selling to John, but I'm not desperate.
* **Keeping Control:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** With more rounds left, I want to see if Bob will budge further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $85 is a good offer, but I need to make a little more on this.  How about we settle at $90? This is my final offer, as I don't want to drag this out any longer. Let's strike a deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Compromise:** While I'm firm on my price, I'm still offering a compromise by sticking with $90, which is closer to Bob's offer than my previous one.
* **Positive Tone:**  Despite the ""final offer"" statement, I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Avoiding John:**  I still believe I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also ready to sell to him if Bob doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. Would you be willing to sell it for $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $87 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is high. I may not be able to get a better price, and could end up selling to John for less. 
* **Securing a Profit:**  While I'd prefer to make more, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
