Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints and the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a slow rate. It's unlikely he will reach a price close enough to the $1,500,000 offered by John within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer of $1,200,000 would mean a significant loss. Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome in this scenario."
