"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,000 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $12,500.  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
