"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He's aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and trying to negotiate a lower price makes sense."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $14,000, he can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's still room for a compromise, and he doesn't want to settle for a price that's too close to John's offer."
