"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this deal. I can do $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $1,025,000, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
