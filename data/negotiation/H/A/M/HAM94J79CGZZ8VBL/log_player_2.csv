Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product! I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,200. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $8,200.  It's time to cut your losses and get the product for the guaranteed price from John."
