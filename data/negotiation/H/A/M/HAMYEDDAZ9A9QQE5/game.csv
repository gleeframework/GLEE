"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to get a great product at a competitive price and me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us, as it allows me to acquire the product while still keeping within my budget, and it gives you a decent return on your investment.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows you a good deal. Let's find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  It allows you to earn a good return while still giving me a good deal. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
