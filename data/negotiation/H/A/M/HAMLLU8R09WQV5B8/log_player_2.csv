"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible, and there's a chance I can get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to present this to me. While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'd be willing to offer $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still represent a significant saving for you compared to its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise.**  $13,000 is closer to my ideal price point than what John is selling for, and it's still a decent deal for Alice.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a chance I could push for a lower price, but there's also a chance Alice could walk away and I'd have to buy from John at a higher cost.
* **Time factor:** Continuing the negotiation takes time and effort, and while I want to save money, I'm also trying to be efficient with my time.  

Accepting the offer at $13,000 gives me a good deal while managing the risk and time involved."
