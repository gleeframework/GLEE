"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it will be worth the same to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
