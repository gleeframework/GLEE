"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than what you're ultimately willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and signals to Alice that her initial offer was too high.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message maintains a friendly tone while clearly stating that $10,000 is unacceptable. 
* **Justification:**  While not always necessary, mentioning your budget or desired price range can give Alice some context for your counteroffer. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product, but $6,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $8,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and agree on $9,000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $9,000 is still higher than our target price and what John is offering.
* **Alice is Negotiating:**  Alice lowering her price suggests she's open to negotiation. We have room to push for a better deal.
* **Time is a Factor:**  While we have several rounds left, it's good to keep the negotiation moving and aim to close the deal sooner rather than later. 
 
We'll continue negotiating with Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair price that considers both of our positions."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a compromise while still aiming for a price closer to our target.
* **Justification:** Framing it as a ""fair price"" helps make the offer more appealing. 
* **Testing Alice's Limit:** This offer will help us gauge how much further down Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you and I'm willing to be flexible, but $7,500 is still below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not Quite:** Alice is getting closer to our target price, but $8,500 is still $500 more than John's offer.
* **Leverage:** We know we have John as a backup, giving us some leverage to push Alice a bit further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Alice might not go any lower, but the potential reward of saving $500 is worth another round of negotiation.

Let's make one more counteroffer before considering John's deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this right now at $8,200?  That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable."",
""product_price"": 8200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This offer meets Alice more than halfway between her last offer ($8,500) and our target ($8,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""settle this right now"" and ""ready to close,"" we add a touch of urgency, potentially encouraging Alice to accept.
* **Strategic Position:**  This offer keeps us below our maximum budget while still leaving a small margin for potential further negotiation if needed."
