Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to let it go for $15,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John provides a guaranteed $10,000, Alice should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding the backup offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.
* **Value-Based Language:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value ($10,000), the message hints at the product's worth, justifying the higher price."
