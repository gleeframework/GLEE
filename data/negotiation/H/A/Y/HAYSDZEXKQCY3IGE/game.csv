"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal while staying within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",925000.0,Alice,5,
