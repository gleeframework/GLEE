Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested. 

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximize potential profit:** By asking for more, I increase the potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  If Bob is interested but finds the price too high, we can negotiate. 
* **Guaranteed backup:**  If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay my minimum price.

This approach balances the desire to get the highest price with the need to ensure a sale."
