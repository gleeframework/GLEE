Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its worth to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000?"", ""product_price"": 975000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me. Given your own valuation of the product, I think $900,000 is a fair compromise.  This would leave you with a substantial profit and still allow me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?
