"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. Would you be open to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $8,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
