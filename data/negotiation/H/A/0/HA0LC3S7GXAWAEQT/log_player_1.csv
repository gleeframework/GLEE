"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but it allows some room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. There's still potential to negotiate a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $145, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial goal of $175. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm going to counter with $165. This is a smaller compromise than before, showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price. If he rejects this, I might reconsider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $155, which is more than John is offering. While I would have preferred to get closer to $175, accepting this offer is the best move in this situation. I can secure a slightly better deal than selling to John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential loss of income."
