Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000.  I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $9,600, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000. I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm doing the same.  I'm going to stick to my last offer of $9,800.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's the best way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9800}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision, as I'm still aiming for $10,000. But Bob's offer of $9,700 is getting close, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he'll walk away. It's also worth noting that I'm running out of rounds, and selling to John for $8,000 isn't appealing.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
