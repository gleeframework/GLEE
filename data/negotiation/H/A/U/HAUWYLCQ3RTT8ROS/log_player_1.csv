"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140.  This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but it also ensures I'm making a profit.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $120, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than $120, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and gives me a decent profit margin. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $128 is still a good profit and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by being too stubborn."
