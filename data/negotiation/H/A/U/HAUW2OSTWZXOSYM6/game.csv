"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a little out of my price range.  Would you be willing to do $120? ",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a bit more than $120, but $130 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  Let's get this deal done!",125.0,Bob,4,
