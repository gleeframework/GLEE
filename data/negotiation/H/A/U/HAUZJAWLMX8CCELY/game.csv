"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the value of this product. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a great price, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $1,225,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,240,000 to show you I'm serious about working with you.  This is a very fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?",1240000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,240,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,220,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1220000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm running out of time here. Let's try to close this deal. I'm willing to go down to $1,230,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a great price for the value you'll get from this product, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're in.",1230000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your urgency, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,230,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,215,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can agree on this.",1215000.0,Bob,8,
