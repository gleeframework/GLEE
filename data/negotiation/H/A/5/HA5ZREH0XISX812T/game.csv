Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?,9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you meet me at that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that meets you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8200. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $8200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm thinking of $7500. Can you consider that price?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another counteroffer to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price?",7800.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're really close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",7900.0,Alice,7,
