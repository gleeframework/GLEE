"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $115? It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my original price. How about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is the same price John is offering.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",120.0,Bob,4,
