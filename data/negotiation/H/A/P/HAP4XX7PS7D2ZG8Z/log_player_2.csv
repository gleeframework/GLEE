"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price for a product that's worth so much to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. $900,000 is still a significant amount above Alice's value for the product ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation, so it's better to reject the offer and try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This gives you a significant profit and is a fair starting point for our negotiations."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a compromise that I think still reflects the value of the product to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $825,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point. Bob wants to save as much as possible and there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value for the product, and it's the highest I'm comfortable going at this point."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is the highest you're comfortable going, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable going.  I'm willing to offer $820,000, which is a significant amount for me and gives you a solid profit. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 820000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $820,000 is still a bit above your comfort level, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $840,000. This is a compromise that I think still reflects the value of the product to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, $840,000 is a good compromise considering the following:

* **Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price.**  There's a good chance that further negotiation will only yield a small decrease in price.
* **Time is running out.**  Bob has only 3 rounds left before he has to buy from John at a much higher price.  
* **Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.** This suggests she might be flexible in future rounds, but there's no guarantee.

Accepting this offer allows Bob to get a decent deal without risking having to buy at a significantly higher price from John."
