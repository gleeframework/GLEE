"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price for a product that's worth so much to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This gives you a significant profit and is a fair starting point for our negotiations.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a compromise that I think still reflects the value of the product to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value for the product, and it's the highest I'm comfortable going at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is the highest you're comfortable going, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable going.  I'm willing to offer $820,000, which is a significant amount for me and gives you a solid profit. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.",820000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $820,000 is still a bit above your comfort level, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $840,000. This is a compromise that I think still reflects the value of the product to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think?",840000.0,Alice,7,
