Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice, along with a possible offer:

**Strategy:**

Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000, which is her minimum acceptable price. However,  she doesn't know Bob's financial limits or how much he might be willing to pay above the product's inherent value to him. Therefore, Alice should aim high to maximize her potential profit. 

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aim High:** Starting at $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation and allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message's tone is open-ended (""What are your thoughts?""), signaling to Bob that Alice is willing to discuss the price.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she can sell the product for its minimum value if Bob declines.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:** If possible, researching similar products or Bob's typical purchasing behavior could give Alice a stronger starting point for her price.
* **Relationship:**  If Alice has a long-standing relationship with Bob or wants to encourage future business, she might adjust her starting price slightly lower. However, starting high and negotiating down can still be an effective strategy in such cases."
