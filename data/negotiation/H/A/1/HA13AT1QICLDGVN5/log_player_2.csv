"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down to $9,500. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8500 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $8,500.  At this point, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to further back and forth, potentially delaying the purchase.  Accepting Alice's offer at $9,000 secures the product for a price that is within Bob's budget and represents a good deal compared to John's price of $10,000."
