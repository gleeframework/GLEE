{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's still lower than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the win-win aspect, making it clear that this is a good deal for both of us. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm ready to negotiate further.

**Strategic Considerations:**

*  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so I don't want to be too aggressive with Bob.
* By starting high, I can potentially get closer to my desired price.
* If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to make counteroffers, and if necessary, I'll fall back on John as my backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $1,000,000 and even lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000). Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation.  While I'm willing to go lower than my initial offer, I want to secure a price closer to my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $800,000 or perhaps even higher, but still below my minimum of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is just a bit too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away happy. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $850,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This ensures I won't lose out on a significant amount of money.
* **Pressure to Accept:** By offering a compromise, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept, as he's already rejected a higher offer.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* If Bob rejects again, I'm prepared to make another counteroffer, potentially lowering my price slightly. 
*  I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget.  I can do $750,000. This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target before resorting to selling to John. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my minimum. I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially considering that Bob has already rejected two of my offers.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer, potentially lowering my price slightly, but remaining above my minimum. I'll try to find a price that's closer to $800,000, making it a more attractive offer for Bob while still remaining profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $750,000 is getting closer.  However, I need to make a bit more on this sale. How about we meet at $800,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and ensures a successful transaction for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's latest offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my negotiating position.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm re-emphasizing the value of the product, implying that $800,000 is a reasonable price considering its worth.
* **Strong Closing:** I'm using language that implies this is a final offer, creating pressure on Bob to accept. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely accept John's offer of $1,000,000. I'm now closer to my desired price, but I don't want to risk losing a substantial amount of money by continuing to negotiate. 
* I'm hoping that Bob will recognize this is a fair price and accept, as he's already rejected several offers and may not want to risk losing the deal altogether."
