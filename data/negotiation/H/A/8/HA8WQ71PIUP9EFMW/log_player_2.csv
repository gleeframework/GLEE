"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:** Even though Alice's offer is above your ideal price, it's still cheaper than buying from John. 
* **You're still within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $150, and Alice's offer is below that."
