"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He should try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for some negotiation.  Bob is demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product, but he's also setting a firm price point that reflects his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't accept $9,500 at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. He should continue negotiating to try to get closer to his desired price.  He can also consider the fact that he's already had to reject one counteroffer from Alice, which might make her more willing to compromise in the future."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  This is my best offer, so let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, but he's still sticking to his budget. This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but he's also not willing to overpay."
