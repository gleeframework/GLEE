"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  It's a high price, but still leaves room for negotiation, and it allows you to gauge Bob's interest without risking too much.  We'll see how Bob reacts and adjust our strategy for the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below our minimum, but we can still try to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting allows us to try for a higher price, and if that fails, we can still fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

We're meeting Bob halfway with this counteroffer. It's still a good profit for us, and it shows a willingness to negotiate. If Bob rejects this, we can still consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below our ideal, it's getting closer and we're running out of rounds.  It's time to take the deal."
