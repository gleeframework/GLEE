"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1000000 to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $875000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $875000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go a bit lower, to $825000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer, so I'll counter with $850000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit lower, to $810000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll counter with $820000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",820000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $820000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $795000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",795000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $795000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give away the product at a price that's below its value to me. I'll counter with $815000, which is the lowest I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer.",815000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made a lot of concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $795000, but that's as low as I'll go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options.",795000.0,Bob,10,
