"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better price for the product. I'm willing to consider a compromise, and I'm proposing a counteroffer of $875000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I've reviewed your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $860000. This aligns closer with my budget while still acknowledging the product's worth. I hope we can reach an agreement.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm proposing a final counteroffer of $870000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,

"I've carefully considered your final counteroffer, Alice. While I respect your position, I would like to propose a price of $865000. This is my last offer before considering purchasing the product from another source. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both parties.",865000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $875000. I'm not willing to compromise further. If you're not willing to meet my price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $800000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm giving you one last chance to reconsider. If not, I'll have to move forward with the sale to John.",875000.0,Alice,7,
