"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially exceeding $1200000. While I can't disclose the exact details at this time, I'm confident it will be of great interest to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a limited-time offer, so please consider it carefully. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to pressure Bob by claiming she has another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000. However, Bob knows he can get the same product from John for $1,000,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially beneficial option."
