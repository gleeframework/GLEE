"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can make this deal work.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product, as I think that's a fair price considering the market value. I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",85.0,Bob,4,
