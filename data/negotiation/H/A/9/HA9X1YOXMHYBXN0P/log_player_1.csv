"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the value of the product can entice Bob to consider a higher price.

**Note:** This is just a starting point. I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, considering the number of rounds remaining and the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand your product's value and I am interested in purchasing it. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's initial counteroffer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I have multiple rounds left, and I can potentially get closer to my target price.
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I want to explore the negotiation with Bob further.  I'm hoping I can get a better price than $10,000, but John remains a safe fallback option. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. 
* I'll carefully consider my counteroffer based on the remaining rounds and the potential to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $11,500. This price still allows for a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product. "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Value Emphasized:**  I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob that the price is still favorable compared to its worth. 
* **Positive Language:**  The message remains positive and friendly, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 

**Thinking Ahead:**

* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 7 rounds left, so I still have time to negotiate.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $15,000 is tempting, I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob with further negotiation. 
* **Flexibility:** I'll be ready to adjust my counteroffer in the next round depending on Bob's response."
