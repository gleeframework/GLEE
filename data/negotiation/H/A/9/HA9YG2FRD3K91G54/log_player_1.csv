"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to maximize my profit.  If Bob is serious about buying, he might counter with a price closer to his value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'll try to counter and see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still a little above Bob's value, but it's closer to my minimum. Hopefully, he'll see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob keeps lowering his offer, and I'm starting to run out of time. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  John is a guaranteed $10,000, so I'm going to take that option and avoid further negotiation."
