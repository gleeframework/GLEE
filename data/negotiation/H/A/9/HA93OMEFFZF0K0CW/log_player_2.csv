"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you, and I'll be able to make a good profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

* **The goal is to save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John."
