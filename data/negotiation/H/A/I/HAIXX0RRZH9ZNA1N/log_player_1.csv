Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive language:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation, allowing me to potentially earn more than $12,000 if Bob is willing to pay a higher price. 
* **John as backup:** The existence of John, a buyer willing to pay $15,000, gives me confidence to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While $9,000 is unacceptable, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can potentially reach a compromise that's closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the leverage to reject Bob's low offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is a compromise:**  $10,500 is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive language:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes mutual benefit. 
* **Focus on the middle ground:** By suggesting a meeting in the middle, I frame the counter-offer as a reasonable compromise, increasing the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $10,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000.  Would you do $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While $9,500 is unacceptable, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can potentially reach a compromise that's closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the leverage to reject Bob's low offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference one more time.  How about $10,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final compromise:**  $10,250 is a final compromise, offering a slight increase from Bob's last offer while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Sense of urgency:**  The phrase ""keeps the deal moving forward"" subtly suggests that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, the deal might fall through. 
* **Close to my desired price:**  While $10,250 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise that I'm comfortable accepting if Bob is unwilling to go higher."
