"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That way, we both get a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference one more time.  How about $10,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.  What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
