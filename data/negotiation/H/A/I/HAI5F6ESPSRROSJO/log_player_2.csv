Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product for $90. It's still a good deal for you, considering its value to you is $80. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

It seems like Alice is not willing to budge much further. Her offer is still above my budget, and I'm better off securing the product from John at my maximum price."
