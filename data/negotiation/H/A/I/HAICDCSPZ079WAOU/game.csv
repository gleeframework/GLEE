"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I am unable to meet your asking price of $10000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $9500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9800. It's a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I appreciate your offer, I still feel that $9800 is slightly out of my budget. I am willing to pay up to $9600 for the product. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price?",9600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9600. I can offer you the product for $9700. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",9700.0,Alice,5,
