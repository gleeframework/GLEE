It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially since Alice's offer is still a significant amount of money.  You can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."

I'm going to start by offering $850,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's original offer, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for potential negotiation."

Alice has come down a little, but it's still too high for my liking.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

I'm going to offer $875,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. It shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible."

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a stalemate.  While I'd prefer to pay less, $912,500 is a good price, especially since John would charge me $1,000,000.  I'm going to accept this offer."
