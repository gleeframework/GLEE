Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $18,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your interest, but $9,000 is significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to make my final offer at $12,500.  This is a very fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she's still significantly above your $10,000 limit. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, especially since she called her last offer ""final.""  You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price, so it's time to cut your losses and buy from him."
