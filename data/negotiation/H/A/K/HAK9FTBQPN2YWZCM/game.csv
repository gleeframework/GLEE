"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? That would be a win-win for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
