"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal. However, I'm open to negotiation and will consider Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this shows good faith while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiations, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go lower.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize he can't get a better deal elsewhere and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I need to make a decision. Bob continues to offer a price below my minimum acceptable price. While I could keep negotiating, I'm starting to run out of time.  Since John is offering my minimum price, it's the most sensible option to sell to him now."
