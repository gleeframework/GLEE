"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $18,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $14,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price.",14500.0,Alice,5,
