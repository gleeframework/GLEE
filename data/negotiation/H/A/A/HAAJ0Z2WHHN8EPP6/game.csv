"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $17000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $16000 for the product.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16000. I'll meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $16500. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a good investment.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll make one more compromise, and I'll sell the product to you for $17000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",17000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet on the price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I'll sell the product to you for $17500.
