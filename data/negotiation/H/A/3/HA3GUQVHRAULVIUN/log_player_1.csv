Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's guaranteed offer. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Justification:** The message highlights the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing specifics that Bob could use in a counter-offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's perspective, signaling potential flexibility for a deal.

By setting the initial price at $1,350,000, Alice aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts, Alice gets a better price than John's offer.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will indicate his willingness to negotiate within a range favorable to Alice.

This strategy prioritizes securing the best possible outcome for Alice while acknowledging the potential deal with John as a fallback option."
