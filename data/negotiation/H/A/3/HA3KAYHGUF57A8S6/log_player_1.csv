Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball.  If not, I can always fall back to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $750000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I need to hold out for a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's try $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
