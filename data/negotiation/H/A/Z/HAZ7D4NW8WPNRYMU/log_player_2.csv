**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still above my target price. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to try another counteroffer before considering buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is the closest I can get to your offer without going below my minimum price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is a good compromise.  While I'd love to get it even lower, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate or Alice walking away is too high.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer."
