"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  I value it highly, but I believe it could be even more impactful in your hands. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll propose $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
