Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. I'm looking for a more reasonable price, considering my budget constraints. I would like to propose an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

Bob's offer is a significant jump down, and it's still significantly below his perceived value. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price point. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've carefully considered your offer, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe we can find a price closer to my budget. I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now negotiating in smaller increments, which suggests he's getting closer to his maximum price. We are still far above our minimum and can afford to push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down slightly. Let's settle on $1,125,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to accommodate my budget, Alice. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. This brings us closer to my financial limits while still allowing us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is holding firm at $1,100,000, and we are already past the halfway point in negotiations. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
