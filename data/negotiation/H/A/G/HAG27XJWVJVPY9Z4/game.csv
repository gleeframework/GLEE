"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a lower price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would still be a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
