# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000 to part with it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his maximum price, and he can get the product from John for $12,000.  There's no reason to pay more."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $18,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?

Bob should still reject the offer. While $15,000 is closer to his maximum price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  He should continue to try and negotiate a lower price."

It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
