"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000 to part with it. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum value I see in this product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $18,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only comfortable paying $13,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
