"Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product in your hands.  I'm offering it to you at $1,400,000.  This price reflects the significant value it holds for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, it's simply too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and still allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000, which would be $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
