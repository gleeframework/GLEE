"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay top dollar for it. I'm willing to let it go for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm happy to pay $15000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $17000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $16000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go down to $16000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $16500. That's as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16500.0,Alice,5,
