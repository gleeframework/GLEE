Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is willing to pay $100, so $175 gives him room to negotiate while still giving you a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to accept no less than $150, so there's still room for negotiation on your end. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** You state your offer and encourage Bob to respond. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum price of $150.  It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price range.  You can make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $140.  This is a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price range.  You can counter-offer again in the next round and aim for a price closer to $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product is well worth it."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below your minimum price of $150. While you could continue to negotiate,  selling to John for $150 guarantees you your minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
