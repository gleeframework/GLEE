{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is a great value for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to get him to see its worth.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This gives Bob a chance to engage and negotiate, making the process more collaborative. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $12,000."

* **Time to counter:** By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target, maintaining control of the negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will propose a counteroffer that is higher than $8,000 but still lower than my desired price, aiming for a middle ground.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I will continue to assess the situation, keeping in mind the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
