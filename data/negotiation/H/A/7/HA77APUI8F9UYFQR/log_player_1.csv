"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. To kick off our negotiation, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a deal that's highly favorable. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high number ($2,300,000), you ""anchor"" the negotiation in that range.  Even if the price eventually comes down, it will likely remain closer to your initial offer than if you started lower.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:** Starting high allows you to make concessions in subsequent rounds, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and encourage him to stay engaged.

**Important Note:**  Even though I'm starting high, I need to be mindful of not alienating Bob with an outrageously high offer. I'll gauge his reactions in the next rounds to adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and my initial ask. There's plenty of room for negotiation. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a higher price and encourage him to make a more competitive counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but  $1,800,000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  To keep things moving, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  I feel this is a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer ($200,000 reduction), demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** However, my new price of $2,100,000 is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum. This keeps me in a strong negotiating position.
* **Justification:**  I've reiterated the product's value to justify the higher price, aiming to frame the negotiation around its worth rather than just arbitrary numbers. 

I'll carefully consider Bob's response in the next round to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $2,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $2,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 plus a reasonable profit margin. Bob is clearly willing to move closer to my range, and I want to encourage that. 

While I could accept John's offer at this point, I believe there's a good chance I can secure a better deal with Bob if I continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground here. I've given this some more thought, and to show you how serious I am about getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision. This can be a powerful tool in negotiations, but it's important to use it strategically.
* **Strategic Concession:** I've made another substantial concession, bringing me closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a respectable margin above my absolute minimum.
* **Justification:** I've reiterated the product's value and emphasized the compromise I'm making, subtly nudging Bob towards a yes.

This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. His response in the next round will be crucial in determining whether we can close a deal or if I need to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,925,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price and represents a strong profit. While I could potentially push for a bit more, there's also the risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation could become unproductive. 

Accepting this offer provides a good balance of maximizing profit and securing the deal without unnecessary risk or delay."
