"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to meet you halfway. This still gives you a significant benefit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,075,000 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me. To be completely transparent, I'm considering selling to John for $1,000,000 if we can't reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,090,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.  It's a fair price for both of us.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your transparency about considering selling to John, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $1,080,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
