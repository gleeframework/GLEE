"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $81.25.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal.",81.25,Bob,4,
