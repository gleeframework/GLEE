Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a large portion of the potential surplus. This leaves room for negotiation but still sets a strong initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the initial $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer. I believe this will keep the negotiation moving forward."

{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but still keeping it above Bob's current offer. We're getting closer to a potential deal, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm still within the negotiation window and haven't reached my desired price. I believe I can get a slightly better offer with another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000} 
```

I'm making a small concession, bringing the price down to $1,275,000. This shows my willingness to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still holding out for a higher price than his last offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,225,000. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my original target, the risk of losing the deal to John and getting only $1,000,000 outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
