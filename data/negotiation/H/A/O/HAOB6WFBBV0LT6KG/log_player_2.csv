Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1300000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1600000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1450000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1700000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget. You've had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,700,000.  At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. This is a guaranteed purchase at a price you can afford."
