"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, your price is a bit high for my current budget. I'm interested in this product but I'm only able to offer $1300000 right now.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1300000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1600000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1600000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1450000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset. Let's reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1450000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1700000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
