"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we settle at $13,500? That would be a comfortable price point for me.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you a price of $15,500. I believe this is the lowest I can go without losing too much value on the product. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  To be honest, $15,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $14,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, $14,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,750. I think this is the best compromise we can reach. What do you think?",14750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're nearing the limits of what's possible. I can offer $14,250. If that doesn't work, I might have to consider other options.",14250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the limit, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $15,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,750 was a good compromise, but I can do $14,800. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",14800.0,Alice,9,
