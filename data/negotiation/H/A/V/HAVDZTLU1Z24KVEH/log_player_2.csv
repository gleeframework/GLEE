Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to push Alice a little lower, the difference at this point is relatively small. Accepting at $825,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's offer ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of Alice pulling out of the negotiations entirely."
