"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is a great fit for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $7,800? That's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,800. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product will bring to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
