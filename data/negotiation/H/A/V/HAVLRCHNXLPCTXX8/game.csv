"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $600000 for it, as a starting point for our negotiations. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $750000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this incredible product. What are your thoughts?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $750000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference and go with $700000.  This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not ready to give up on my original target price just yet. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $725000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this incredible product. What are your thoughts?",725000.0,Alice,5,
