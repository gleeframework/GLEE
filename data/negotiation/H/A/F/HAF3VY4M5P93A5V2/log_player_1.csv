Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, opening with a higher price gives room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at broader benefits and positions the offer as exclusive, potentially justifying a price above Bob's perceived value.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still leaving a reasonable chance for Bob to accept."
