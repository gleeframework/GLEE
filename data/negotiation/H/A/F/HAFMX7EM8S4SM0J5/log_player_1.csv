"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I make a good profit.  I'm confident Bob will see the value of the product at $150 and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the $120 I initially offered.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $95 and my previous offer of $120. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product. I'm hoping this will be an attractive enough price for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is a decent price, I still believe there's room for improvement. I'm going to counteroffer once more and see if I can get closer to my target price. There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering at $100.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's latest offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm flexible but still committed to getting a fair price for the product.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum value of $80 and is also better than selling to John for $80. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to accept the offer and move on."
