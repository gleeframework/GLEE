"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the significant value this product holds for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
