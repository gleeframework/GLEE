"Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm hoping to get closer to my target price. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This still allows you a significant profit, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
