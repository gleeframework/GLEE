Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm hoping to get closer to my target price. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This still allows you a significant profit, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
