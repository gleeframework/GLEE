"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer on the price. To be honest, $1,100,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
