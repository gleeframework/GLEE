"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,500,000 - a price that's fair to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can finalize the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product at the maximum price you're willing to pay. There's no benefit to accepting her offer immediately. By rejecting it, you might motivate her to lower the price in a counter-offer. If not, you can always buy from John at the same price."
