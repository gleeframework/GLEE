"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no reason to accept a lower price.  Since you are trying to save as much money as possible, it's always best to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $90 for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than $120, you're still trying to save as much as possible. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little higher than where I'd like to be. How about $92? I'm sure we can find a happy medium."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking to save a bit more, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer it to you for $97. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. You've managed to negotiate the price down to $97, which is a significant saving compared to John's price of $120. While you could try to continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and potentially increasing the price is too high."
