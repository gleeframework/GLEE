"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $9500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 11000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $10000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 10000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for 10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
