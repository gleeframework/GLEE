"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield significant returns."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** This initial offer is significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price. This anchoring strategy aims to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a deal closer to your desired outcome.
* **Justify the Price:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to justify the high price.  
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This first offer is also a way to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will provide valuable information for your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial price is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate and try to bring Bob closer to your target. Selling to John right now would secure your minimum, but there's potential to gain more from negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is still a competitive price considering the long-term benefits this product offers."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:** You're lowering your price by $300,000, showing willingness to negotiate. However, you're still significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Continue to emphasize the product's long-term value and benefits to justify the price.
* **Test the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge how much Bob is willing to move and understand his negotiation style better."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. While you could try to push for a little more, there's a risk of Bob backing out or getting stuck in a stalemate. Accepting this offer secures your desired profit and avoids the potential for losing the sale altogether."
