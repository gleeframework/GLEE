"Alice, your initial price is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is still a competitive price considering the long-term benefits this product offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
