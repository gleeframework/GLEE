"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  You should reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious interest while staying within your budget.  It leaves room for negotiation if Alice is unwilling to accept this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but $9,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $11,000 is still above your budget. You should reject and make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  I'm really interested in the product and want to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further compromise, demonstrating a willingness to reach a deal. It's also a fair midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's current offer, increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,500, but I need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $11,250 is still above your desired budget. At this point, you're better off going with John's offer, as it's a guaranteed price within your budget.  Further negotiation with Alice might result in a lower price, but it's not guaranteed, and you risk wasting more time."
