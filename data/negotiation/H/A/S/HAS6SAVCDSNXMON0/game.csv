"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but $9,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  I'm really interested in the product and want to make this work.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,500, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
