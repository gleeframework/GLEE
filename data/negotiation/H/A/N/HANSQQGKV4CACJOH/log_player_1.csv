Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a minimum of $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm starting at $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm framing the offer in terms of the product's value, both to me and potentially to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm clearly indicating that I'm willing to negotiate, making the offer more appealing to Bob. 

This approach allows for a potential mutually beneficial outcome, while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that doesn't at least cover my minimum value.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise.  It also allows me to see if Bob is truly interested in the product at a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a slight adjustment to the price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would still give me a fair return on the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to meet halfway, making it a more attractive offer for Bob. 
* **Maintain value:** Even at $1,050,000, I'm still exceeding my minimum value of $1,000,000. This ensures I don't lose out on the product's worth to me.
* **Positive language:**  I'm using phrases like ""bridge the gap"" to create a sense of collaboration and optimism, making the negotiation feel more positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise on my minimum value.

Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob. This decision is a strategic move to secure my minimum value and avoid potentially losing more time and energy in a drawn-out negotiation."
