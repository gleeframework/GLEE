"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is asking for $9,500. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John for $10,000.** This is within your budget and still allows you to acquire the product.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you save $500 compared to buying from John."
