Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $75. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $72. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:

Alice is clearly trying to come down to a price that works. While I could try to haggle further, $72 is a decent price and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk it going up or her refusing to negotiate further."
