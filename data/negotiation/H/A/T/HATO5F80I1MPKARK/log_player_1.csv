Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000. This is a good starting point, as it's slightly above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this offer is attractive enough to encourage Bob to negotiate, but not so high that it makes him immediately walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,150,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I will counteroffer and aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,225,000. This is a compromise,  meeting him halfway between his offer and my previous one.  It still allows for a good profit for me while also showing flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer is still too low.  I've already made a compromise, and it seems unlikely that he will come up to a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that I can get a better price from John, and selling to him is the best option at this point."
