Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I have to say that $750000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.
