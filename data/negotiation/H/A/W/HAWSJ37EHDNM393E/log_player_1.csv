{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a good price, and I get a solid return. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value of the product, but still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows for potential negotiation while giving you a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$900,000 is still below my desired value. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $950,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$925,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than my minimum, and  Bob is likely to reject any further counteroffers, so it's best to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
