"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects its value to me, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for countering. While $1,400,000 is a respectable figure, I believe it undervalues the true potential and uniqueness of this product.  To move us closer to an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This price represents a significant concession on my part, and I'm hopeful it aligns with your valuation.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
