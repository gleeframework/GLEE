{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation. We have 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum value of $8,000. This allows for some room for negotiation in the remaining rounds while still aiming for a substantial discount."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price, but closer than the initial offer.  I still have rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value.  With 7 rounds remaining, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better price than John's $15,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but keeping it below Alice's last offer.  This shows that I am willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a better price. With 4 rounds left, I think we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my upper limit, but it's still higher than my target. I have 3 rounds left, so I'm still willing to try and negotiate a better price. There's a good chance that Alice will be more willing to compromise as we're running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting close to my upper limit, but I'm still trying to get a better deal. With only two rounds left, I need to be more aggressive. I'm offering $12,000, which is still lower than her last offer but higher than my previous one. This shows that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to give in completely. Hopefully, Alice will see the value in accepting this offer and closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, Alice's offer is only $500 lower than John's price. There is little chance of a successful negotiation in the remaining round.  It's better to go with John and get the product at a predictable price than risk getting a worse deal with Alice."
