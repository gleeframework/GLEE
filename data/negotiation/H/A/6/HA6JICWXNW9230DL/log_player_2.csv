"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can also use this opportunity to gauge how flexible Alice is on price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum budget. This allows for room to negotiate while also signaling my seriousness about purchasing the product.  If Alice rejects this offer, I will likely need to raise my counteroffer in the next round, but I'm hoping this initial offer will make her more receptive to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget. Buying from Alice at this price is the same as buying from John. However, continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a better price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether. Therefore, I choose to accept Alice's offer to secure the product at my limit."
