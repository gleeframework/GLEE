"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? I'm really interested in the product and this would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
