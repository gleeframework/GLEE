"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
