I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident in the value of the product and believe this price is reasonable. It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still hoping to maximize my profit. This offer is closer to Bob's counteroffer, increasing the chances he'll accept while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to secure a better price. I'll counteroffer Bob once more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,850,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still hoping to maximize my profit. This offer is closer to Bob's last counteroffer, increasing the chances he'll accept while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd still prefer to get a higher price, I'm concerned that Bob is not going to budge much further.  At this point, I'm closer to my minimum threshold, but the risk of continuing to negotiate and getting a lower offer isn't worth it. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
