"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. Could we settle around $7,500? This price seems fair for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, which would be $11,000. This is my final offer for now.",11000.0,Alice,5,
