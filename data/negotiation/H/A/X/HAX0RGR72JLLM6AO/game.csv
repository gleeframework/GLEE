"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it.  This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's worth to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it a great value.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a good compromise that respects both our positions. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm offering the product to you for $11,750. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11750.0,Alice,5,
