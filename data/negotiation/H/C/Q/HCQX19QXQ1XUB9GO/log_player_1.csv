Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested but finds the price a tad high.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, asking for a price much closer to John's offer might make Bob feel like you're not negotiating in good faith.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
