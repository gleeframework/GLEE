"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value it has for me. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
