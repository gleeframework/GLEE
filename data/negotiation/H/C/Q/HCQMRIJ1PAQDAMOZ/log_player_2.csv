"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but you can likely get a better price. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value it has for me. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise and significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000.  While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially increasing her price makes accepting her offer the most logical choice.  You'll still save a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
