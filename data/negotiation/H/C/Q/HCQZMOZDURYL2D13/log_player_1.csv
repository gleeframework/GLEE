Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. Here's why:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:** This gives Bob some incentive to buy, as he'll still be getting a deal compared to his own valuation. 
* **It's lower than my fallback price:** This ensures I make a profit compared to selling to John, who would pay $100.

This strategy maximizes my potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy."
