"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get a price that's significantly higher than my minimum.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's higher than what John is offering, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I believe there's room for a better deal with Bob if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering $105.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  However, it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my target price. I think this could be a good middle ground."

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob for another round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $100. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Unfortunately, Bob seems unwilling to budge further, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $80.  While I'd prefer to make more, it's better to secure a sale than risk ending up with nothing."
