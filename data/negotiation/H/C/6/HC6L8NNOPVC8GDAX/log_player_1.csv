Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John offers $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could secure a quicker sale and still yield a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,100,000 is considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for him to potentially negotiate down, getting us closer to our minimum acceptable price.
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the offer as a strategic opportunity for Bob, potentially increasing his willingness to pay a premium. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, we still have the fallback option of selling to John for our guaranteed value."
