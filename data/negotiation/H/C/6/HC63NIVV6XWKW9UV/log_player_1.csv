Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  Ensuring you make a profit.

By starting with a higher price, you leave room for potential negotiation and compromise without sacrificing your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is too low ($100) and significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could accept and get some money, it's not worth jeopardizing my potential profit. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
