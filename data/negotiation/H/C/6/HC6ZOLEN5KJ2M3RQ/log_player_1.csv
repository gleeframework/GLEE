"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong baseline and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to hold firm on my value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. It's also above my minimum price, so I'm still in a good position.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm going to reject his offer again and try to push for a better price in the next round. Selling to John would be the safe option, but I believe I can get more from Bob if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping that by showing flexibility, Bob will see the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  There's a risk that Bob will continue to lowball me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to John guarantees me a safe, acceptable price, and I don't want to waste any more time."
