"Hi Alice, thanks for your opening offer. That price is a bit too high for me, I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding your position. While $700,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a compromise.  Could you consider $1,350,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal given the product's potential.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to move my offer up a bit to $750,000.  This is a significant investment for me, so I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  the $750,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product and what it can do for your business. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this product has a lot of value, but  $1,100,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  I can go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
