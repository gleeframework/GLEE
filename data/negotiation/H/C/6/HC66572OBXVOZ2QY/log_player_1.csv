Round 6
Bob's offer:

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet Alice's price expectations.  While he budged slightly, his final offer of $800,000 is still significantly below Alice's minimum of $1,200,000.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to close this gap. 

Alice has a guaranteed offer from John for her minimum acceptable price. It makes the most business sense to take the guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 rather than risking further time and effort on a deal that's unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome."
