I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is as close as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,050,000 and it's not worth risking a worse deal. Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees the best possible outcome for Bob at this point."
