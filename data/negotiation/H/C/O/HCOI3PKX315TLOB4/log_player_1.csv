I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my potential profit. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get him to move up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly from my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still giving me room to negotiate further. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and meet me halfway."
