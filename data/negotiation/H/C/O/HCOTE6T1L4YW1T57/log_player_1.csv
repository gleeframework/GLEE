Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high offer like $19,000 sets an anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it makes a lower counter-offer from him more likely to be in a range favorable to Alice. 
* **Knowing Your Value:** Alice knows John will buy the product for $10,000, giving her a strong fallback position.  She doesn't need to desperately sell to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price leaves room for Alice to potentially negotiate down, appearing flexible while still aiming for a price significantly above her minimum."
