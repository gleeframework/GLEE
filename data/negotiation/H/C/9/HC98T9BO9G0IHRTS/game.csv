"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to consider $120, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $140,  which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $130, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,4,
