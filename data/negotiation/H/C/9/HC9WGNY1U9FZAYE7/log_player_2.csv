"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it at $10,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have time:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into accepting the first offer.
* **John's price is your ceiling:**  While John is a backup option, you're aiming to save as much as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $9,500 is below your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Good compromise:** Alice has lowered her price, and you've already lowered yours. This feels like a fair compromise.
* **Time is ticking:** You only have 7 rounds left.  While you could potentially get a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John or further rounds of negotiation is increasing."
