Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it will bring to your operations. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows its worth much more to her. Starting with a higher offer ($1,100,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above John's offer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to nudge Bob closer to Alice's desired price range. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has the security of John's offer ($1,200,000) if Bob rejects her initial proposal. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while still offering Bob a seemingly reasonable deal compared to its true value to Alice."
