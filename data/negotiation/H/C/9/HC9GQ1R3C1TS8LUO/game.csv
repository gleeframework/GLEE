"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $850,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while still providing you with substantial value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $825,000 or lower. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my financial constraints.",825000.0,Bob,4,
