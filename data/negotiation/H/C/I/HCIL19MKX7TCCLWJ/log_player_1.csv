"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This leaves some room for negotiation while still getting a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, but I still want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $8,500 is a good price, and I'm worried that continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to take a good profit than risk getting stuck with $8,000 from John."
