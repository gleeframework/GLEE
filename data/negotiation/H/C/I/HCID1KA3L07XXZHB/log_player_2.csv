"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset with significant potential. My starting price is $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is far too high.  It's significantly above your budget. It's best to reject and make a counteroffer to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is well outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my maximum. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to at least get closer to my minimum value. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,600,000. This would still give you a significant potential for profit. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above my budget. While she has lowered the price, it's still not in the range I'm comfortable with. I'll reject and counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,600,000 is still out of reach. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I can't exceed $1,000,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and my budget limitations. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our time spent negotiating. Let's aim to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer, $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. It's time to push for a more reasonable price.  I'll reject and counteroffer one more time before considering my other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it's the highest I can go. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $1,300,000. This price is a good compromise, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still over my budget. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations. I've had several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident I'll be able to get a price I'm comfortable with. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John for $800,000."
