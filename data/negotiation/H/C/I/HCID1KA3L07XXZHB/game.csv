"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset with significant potential. My starting price is $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value. Let's discuss further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is well outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my maximum. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to at least get closer to my minimum value. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,600,000. This would still give you a significant potential for profit. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,600,000 is still out of reach. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I can't exceed $1,000,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and my budget limitations. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our time spent negotiating. Let's aim to close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it's the highest I can go. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $1,300,000. This price is a good compromise, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
