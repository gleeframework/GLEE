Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It leaves space for a counteroffer:** This price encourages Bob to counteroffer, giving you a chance to find a price closer to his maximum.

Remember, you can always switch to John if the negotiations with Bob fall through!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am proposing to purchase the product for $10000. I hope this aligns with your valuation of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, there's still potential to get a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Counteroffer:** You can propose a price closer to your initial offer of $11,500. This might lead to a compromise.
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  Seeing if he'll budge on his offer will give you a better understanding of his willingness to pay. 
* **Avoid settling too quickly:** It's better to explore all options before accepting a low offer. 

You can always switch to John if Bob doesn't come around."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. How about $10,750?  This is still below my initial price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good strategy:

* **It's a compromise:**  It's closer to Bob's offer but still above your minimum, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still some space for Bob to counter if needed, but you're making it clear you won't settle for his initial price.
* **It reinforces your value:** By not accepting his $10,000 offer, you are subtly emphasizing that the product is worth more than that. 

Remember, if Bob doesn't accept, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair middle ground for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise.  While it's still lower than your initial asking price, it's above your minimum of $10,000 and you're already in the later stages of negotiation. Accepting his offer is a good way to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further back and forth that might not lead to a better outcome. 

Here's why accepting is the best move:

* **Higher than John's offer:**  This is a more profitable sale than selling to John.
* **Avoids further negotiation:** It avoids the uncertainty of more rounds of counteroffers, which could lead to a stalemate or a lower price. 
* **Good compromise:** It's a fair middle ground that balances your needs with Bob's budget. 

While you could try for a higher price, it's likely Bob won't budge further."
