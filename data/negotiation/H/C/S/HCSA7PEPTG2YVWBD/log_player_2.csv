Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit above the middle ground, Bob. I can do $155, but that's as close to the middle as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $155. It's better to secure the product at John's price of $150 rather than risk Alice sticking to her price."
