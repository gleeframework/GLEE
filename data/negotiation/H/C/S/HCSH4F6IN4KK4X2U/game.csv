"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think you'll find it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go a bit higher. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer. I can do $9800, but that's as low as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",9800.0,Bob,6,
