"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to go up to $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price but $9500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really keen on this product, but $9000 is the absolute most I can offer. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer the product to you for $9200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
