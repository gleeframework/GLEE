Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised by offering it to you for $16,500, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to me.
