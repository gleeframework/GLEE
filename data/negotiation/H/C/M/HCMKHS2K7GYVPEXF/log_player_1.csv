Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. I believe I can offer a fair price of $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $9,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going for a slightly higher counteroffer. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up just a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value and condition of the product, I would like to propose an offer of $9,200. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is only $300 less than my last counteroffer and is getting very close to my minimum value. It's not worth risking losing the sale and having to sell to John for $12,000."
