"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to my valuation. How about we consider $1,600,000? This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but how about we settle on $1,650,000? This still leaves a significant profit margin for you while ensuring a fair return for my investment. Let's meet in the middle.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
