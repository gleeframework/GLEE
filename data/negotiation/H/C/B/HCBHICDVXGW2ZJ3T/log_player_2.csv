"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:** I want to maintain a positive tone while making it clear I'm looking for a better deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts me in a good position. Alice might accept, counter with a price closer to my limit, or I can still walk away and buy from John for $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but there's still room for negotiation. Alice is willing to come down, indicating flexibility. I'll push a little further before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $100? That's a fair price, and we both come out ahead."",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** I'm proposing a price slightly below the midpoint between our last offers. This shows a willingness to compromise but keeps me closer to my target.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** By emphasizing a ""win-win"" scenario, I'm appealing to Alice's desire to make a sale while reinforcing my position.
* **Pressure Point:** Offering $100 (Alice's value) puts a bit of pressure on her. She might accept for a small profit, or her counter-offer will reveal how much she's truly willing to budge."
