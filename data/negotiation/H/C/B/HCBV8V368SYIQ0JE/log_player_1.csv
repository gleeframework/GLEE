Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it offers great value at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering it at $150, we can gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects, we know he's likely very price-sensitive. If he counters, we can negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no risk of losing money by aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay. If we had more information, we might adjust our strategy."
