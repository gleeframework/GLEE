"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than the value you place on it. I know you're a savvy businessman, and I'm confident you'll recognize the potential of this product. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
