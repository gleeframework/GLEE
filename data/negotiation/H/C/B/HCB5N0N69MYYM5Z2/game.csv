"Alice, while I see the potential value in this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good value for you, considering your cost.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant long-term value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still out of my price range.  Let's meet halfway again.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This shows a significant commitment on my part, and hopefully we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
