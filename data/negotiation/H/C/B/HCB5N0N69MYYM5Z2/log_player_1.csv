Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the potential value in this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good value for you, considering your cost. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant long-term value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still out of my price range.  Let's meet halfway again.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This shows a significant commitment on my part, and hopefully we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:** While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $1,000,000 within the remaining rounds.  It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John now."
