Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still make a profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $100 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Considering Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay slightly more if the offer is presented well.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how likely he is to accept a higher price."
