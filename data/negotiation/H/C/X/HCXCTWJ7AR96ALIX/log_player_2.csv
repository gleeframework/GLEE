# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I can come down slightly to $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,375,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in trying to find a middle ground. To be frank, $1,400,000 is already a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. However, I value closing this deal with you. Let's meet in the middle - $1,387,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,387,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,387,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,387,500 is below Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's counteroffer:** The offer is only $12,500 higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $1,375,000. 
* **It's likely Alice won't go lower:** Alice stated this was her ""final offer,"" implying she's unlikely to budge further.

Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's within budget and a good deal compared to John's offer."
