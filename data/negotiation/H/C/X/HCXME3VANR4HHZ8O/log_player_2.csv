"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This price reflects the significant worth of the product.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still within your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better deal.  There's a good chance she's willing to come down in price, especially since you haven't expressed any strong interest yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000 for this product.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 800000}
