"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
 
The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, but you are willing to pay up to $800,000. Alice's offer of $900,000 is too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's still a good deal for you compared to the $1,000,000 you could pay if you were to buy it from John. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your target. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from your original price and a great opportunity for you to sell it quickly. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000, which is still a good compromise between our initial offers. This price reflects the value I place on the product and the urgency I have to sell it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $860,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000 to ensure you stay within your budget."
