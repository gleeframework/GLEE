"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $105 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  You're aiming to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $95, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $105. This demonstrates my commitment to getting a good deal while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still not as low as I'd like. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue bargaining and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $98. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. It's also a reasonable amount to offer given the previous rounds. This move aims to close the deal while still aiming for a price below my $100 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $102 is now closer to my target price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and the potential for Alice to make a higher counter-offer  is increasing. It's more beneficial to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that is still within my budget."
