"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet somewhere closer to the middle? Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high for you, but $650,000 is a bit low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, my absolute maximum budget for this is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider something around $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, $725,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
