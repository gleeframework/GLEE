Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in your product, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range considering my budget.  This will hopefully encourage Alice to negotiate further."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am glad to hear that you're still interested despite the initial price.

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my maximum of $10,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation before committing to a price I'm not comfortable with or resorting to John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for $12,000, but I'm still capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this price would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise that's closer to Alice's price, but still within my budget. This shows I'm serious about buying the product and hope to encourage her to accept."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After considering your offer, I am willing to agree on a price of $11500 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to come to a fair agreement. I hope this proposal works for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $10,000. With more rounds left, it's worth attempting to further negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? This is the absolute maximum I can go."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting closer to my absolute maximum budget with this offer.  This shows Alice I'm serious about purchasing the product but am also firm on my budget. I'm hoping that the closer proximity to my budget will incentivize her to accept, but I'm ready to walk away if necessary."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I am willing to agree on a price of $11000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking a further negotiation.  I'm confident that John's offer of $10,000 is the best deal I can get, and I'd rather secure the product at that price than risk a potential breakdown in negotiations with Alice."
