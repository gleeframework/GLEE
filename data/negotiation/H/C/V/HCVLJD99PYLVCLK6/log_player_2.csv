Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go up to $80, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and firm:** This message is direct about your budget limit, signaling that you're unlikely to move much higher.
* **Final offer implication:** By stating your ""absolute limit,"" you're subtly implying this might be your final offer, encouraging Alice to make a decision.
* **Time pressure:**  With only a few rounds left, you're introducing a sense of urgency for Alice to accept a deal. 

Now, it's up to Alice. If she's truly motivated to sell, she might accept your $80. If not, you can always take John's offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can do $90, but I think I can do a bit better than that. Let's try to get closer to the value I have in mind. How about $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging:**  Alice has gone up in price from her previous offer, indicating she's unlikely to meet your target of $80.
* **Limited rounds:** With only one round left, the chances of significantly lowering the price with Alice are slim.
* **John's guaranteed offer:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $80, ensuring you don't miss out on the product entirely. 

It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
