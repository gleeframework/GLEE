"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from what I would normally charge, and it allows you to acquire a valuable asset for a price that is still well below its worth to you.  I'm confident this deal is mutually beneficial. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below her valuation, it's still more than what John is offering you. You can save $100,000 by going with John."
