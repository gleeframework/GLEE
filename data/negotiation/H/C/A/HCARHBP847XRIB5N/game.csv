"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me at this moment. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it. This would still be a very profitable deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable paying. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for you. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this point. Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $900,000. This would give you a healthy profit and allow me to acquire the product at a reasonable price. I'm confident this is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business, and it's still a significant profit for me.",975000.0,Alice,5,
