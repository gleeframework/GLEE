Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me at this moment. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it. This would still be a very profitable deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable paying. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

I believe this is a fair price, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this point. Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $900,000. This would give you a healthy profit and allow me to acquire the product at a reasonable price. I'm confident this is a fair compromise.
