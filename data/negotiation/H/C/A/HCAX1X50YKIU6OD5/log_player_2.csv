"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  You can try to get a better price from Alice.  It's unlikely Alice will drop to your target of $100, but you might be able to reach a compromise in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $115? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is within my budget and a good deal.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and me having to buy from John at $150 is too high.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
