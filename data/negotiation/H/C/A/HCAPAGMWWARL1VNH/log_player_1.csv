Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 leaves some room for negotiation (if Bob wants to haggle) but still secures a significant profit above our minimum ($10,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy it for $10,000 gives us a safety net, but we aim higher with Bob."
