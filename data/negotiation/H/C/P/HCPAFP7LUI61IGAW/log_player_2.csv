# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a significant amount for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as that. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000.
