"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping for.",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my absolute max.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,4,
