"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $105. I'm thinking of a price of $112.50. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $112.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $108.75? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",108.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $110.50. It's the highest I can go without losing money on the deal.",110.5,Alice,5,
