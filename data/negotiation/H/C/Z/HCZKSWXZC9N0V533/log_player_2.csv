"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $13,000. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $13,000.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice is willing to sell for $11,500, which is significantly above her own valuation ($8,000). This indicates she's motivated to sell.
* **Bob's Value:**  The price of $11,500 is still well within Bob's budget of $15,000, and offers a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the likelihood of Alice going much lower than $11,500 is slim, considering her willingness to compromise from $13,000.

Therefore, accepting the offer at $11,500 is the most financially beneficial choice for Bob."
