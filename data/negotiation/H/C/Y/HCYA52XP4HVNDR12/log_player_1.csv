{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but still gives me a profit. 
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a good deal for Bob and encourage him to consider it.  
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's tempting to take $1,100,000, it's significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum value.
* **Selling to John:**  While John offers the best price, I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob first. If I can't reach a mutually acceptable price, I'll then consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is just not workable for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the value of the product for you, and it's still a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,200,000. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum value. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing that I'm trying to be flexible while also making it clear that $1,100,000 is simply not acceptable.
* **Strategy:**  By offering a counteroffer, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate but also setting a clear boundary.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a more significant offer. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  $1,050,000 is far below my minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is not fruitful.** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offers are consistently too low. It's unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John offers the best value.** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose out financially. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a profitable deal and avoid further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiations with Bob."
