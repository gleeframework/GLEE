"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my value and Bob's.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to hopefully entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $105? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $105 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise and go with $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, and I'd like to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $108 is close to my minimum value, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still a chance to get a better deal with Bob. I'm confident I can convince him to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $108 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference again and go with $109? This way, both of us can walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $109 is my absolute maximum. I'm willing to go as low as $106, and that's the final offer I can make. Please let me know if we can make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiation and with Bob refusing to budge beyond $106, I'm running the risk of reaching the end of the rounds without a satisfactory deal.  While I would prefer to have gotten more from Bob, $150 from John is a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum value. I'll go with John."
