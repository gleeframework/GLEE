"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $105? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $105 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise and go with $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, and I'd like to make a deal with you.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $108 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference again and go with $109? This way, both of us can walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",109.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $109 is my absolute maximum. I'm willing to go as low as $106, and that's the final offer I can make. Please let me know if we can make a deal at that price.",106.0,Bob,8,
