"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000? This price still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,080,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of your product while also aligning with my financial situation. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
