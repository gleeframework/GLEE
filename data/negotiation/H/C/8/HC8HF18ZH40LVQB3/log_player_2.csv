"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still above Bob's ideal budget. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $880,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $880,000 is closer to Bob's ideal budget and significantly better than John's offer of $800,000. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting future offers, potentially leading to a dead end or a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal within the allotted rounds and limits potential risks."
