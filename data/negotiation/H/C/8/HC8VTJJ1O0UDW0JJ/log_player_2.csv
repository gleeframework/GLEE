Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point reflects the true value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I appreciate you being upfront about your budget. To be candid, $800,000 is cutting it very close to my absolute minimum. I'm willing to offer a significant compromise at $1,600,000. This offer reflects my strong desire to work with you while respecting the product's value. Let me know what you think.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but we need to bridge this gap more quickly to reach an agreement.  My final offer is $1,400,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to conclude this deal.  I need a decision from you on this round â€“ are you in or out? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has given an ultimatum and is unlikely to go much lower than $1,400,000.  While she might come down a little in further rounds, it's very improbable that she'll get close to your $800,000 limit.  You've already explored raising your offer, and further negotiation seems unproductive.  Therefore, the best option is to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000, ensuring you stay within your budget."
