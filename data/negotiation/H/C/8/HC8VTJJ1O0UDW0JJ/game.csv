"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing this product with you.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm more comfortable in the ballpark of $600,000.  I believe that represents a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point reflects the true value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than what I had in mind. Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?  I need to stick within a certain budget, and this is a fair offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I appreciate you being upfront about your budget. To be candid, $800,000 is cutting it very close to my absolute minimum. I'm willing to offer a significant compromise at $1,600,000. This offer reflects my strong desire to work with you while respecting the product's value. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that this price is close to your minimum, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000 to show you I'm serious about making this work.  Hopefully, this demonstrates my willingness to compromise.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but we need to bridge this gap more quickly to reach an agreement.  My final offer is $1,400,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to conclude this deal.  I need a decision from you on this round â€“ are you in or out?",1400000.0,Alice,7,
