"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $950,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000. How about we try $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand that $975,000 is your absolute limit, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $975,000. How about we try $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
