Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a fair starting point, as it's above my minimum value and gives Bob some room to negotiate.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and still above my minimum value. I'm hoping that Bob will find this price reasonable and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $105 is a good price - it's above my minimum value of $100 and it seems like Bob is willing to pay more. It's likely we won't get a better price, and it's not worth risking a deal by continuing to negotiate."
