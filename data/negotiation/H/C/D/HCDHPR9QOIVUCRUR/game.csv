"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still allows me to make a good profit.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $8500.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
