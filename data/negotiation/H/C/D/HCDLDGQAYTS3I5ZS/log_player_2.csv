"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $12,000 is still more than the product's value to you. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price. 
* There are still 9 rounds left, giving you ample time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for your counteroffer. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Alice's Value:** You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so offering $9,000 is still a profit for her. 
* **Negotiation:** By starting lower, you create space to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $11,000 is still above your target price range. You can likely negotiate a lower price.
* **Time to Close the Gap:**  Alice has moved closer to your desired price. Rejecting allows you to continue narrowing the difference and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Rounds Remaining:**  You have 7 rounds remaining to negotiate, giving you ample time to make counteroffers and secure a better deal."
