"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we set the product price at $14,000? I hope this proposal works for you.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired selling point. Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've given your offer some thought. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still not able to meet you halfway at $16,000. I propose we set the product price at $15,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while still obtaining a valuable product. I look forward to your response.",15000.0,Bob,4,
