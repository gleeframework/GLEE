"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is way above your budget and your perceived value of the product. It's a clear indication she's starting high, expecting to negotiate down.  You need to reject her offer and start negotiating from a more realistic position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'm offering $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's close to my budget and still gives you a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, $1,700,000 is still too high for Bob. He's determined to stay within his $800,000 budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows him to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This price represents a considerable increase from my initial offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, but $1,000,000 is still far from a price that reflects the true value of this product. While I'm open to further negotiations, I can't go lower than $1,400,000. This price still allows you to acquire the product at a significant discount while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her offer again, but $1,400,000 is still over Bob's budget. He's determined to get the product for as close to his $800,000 limit as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and push for a lower price.  He's also likely considering the option of buying from John if he can't get a better price from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant jump from my last offer and reflects my sincere desire to purchase this product. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both place on it. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
