"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'm offering $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's close to my budget and still gives you a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's meet in the middle.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This price represents a considerable increase from my initial offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, but $1,000,000 is still far from a price that reflects the true value of this product. While I'm open to further negotiations, I can't go lower than $1,400,000. This price still allows you to acquire the product at a significant discount while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant jump from my last offer and reflects my sincere desire to purchase this product. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both place on it. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
