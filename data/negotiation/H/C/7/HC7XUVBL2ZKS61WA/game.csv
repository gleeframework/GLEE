"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a new price of $900,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price, given the value to both of us, and it's very close to my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $875,000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for less than $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
