"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $115 is close to your limit, but you can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. There's a chance Alice will be willing to lower the price slightly to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $118 is still within your budget, and it's closer to her minimum price point.  While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your next counteroffer or you needing to buy from John at $120 makes accepting her offer the best option."
