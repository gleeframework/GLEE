Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to part with it for $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $20 markup (20% increase) is a reasonable starting point. It allows for some negotiation room while still aiming for a significantly higher profit than your guaranteed sale. 
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is straightforward and emphasizes the potential value to Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always counter-offer with a lower price, gradually approaching your minimum of $100."
