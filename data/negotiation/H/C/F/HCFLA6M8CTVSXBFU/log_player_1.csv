Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on a price closer to $15,000?

Bob is clearly anchored at $15,000 and unlikely to budge. It's not worth further negotiation as I have a guaranteed offer for the same price from John."
