"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to let it go for a price of $20000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is no less than $15000. What do you think? Is $20000 a price you're willing to pay? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
