"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to let it go for a price of $20000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is no less than $15000. What do you think? Is $20000 a price you're willing to pay?",20000.0,Alice,1,
