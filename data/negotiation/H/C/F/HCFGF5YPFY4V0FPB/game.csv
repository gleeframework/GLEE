"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $7500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you like it. However, $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $8000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $8000, but I was thinking we could do even better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8200, which is still a great deal for you. It's my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",8200.0,Alice,5,
