{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $7,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you like it. However, $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I want to pay.  I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $8000, but I was thinking we could do even better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8200, which is still a great deal for you. It's my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already had a few rounds and I'm concerned that I'm unlikely to get a better price.  It's more efficient to go with John's offer and save time and potential frustration."
