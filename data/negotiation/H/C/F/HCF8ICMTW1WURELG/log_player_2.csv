"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's something you've been looking for and it's in excellent condition. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000.  This is a great deal, as it's worth more than that to you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's maximum price is $15,000.
* Alice's offer is $14,000.
* While this is a better price than John's offer, Bob can still get a slightly better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with John."
