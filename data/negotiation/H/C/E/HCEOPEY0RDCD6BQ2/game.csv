"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a really valuable item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $90, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $100. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,6,
