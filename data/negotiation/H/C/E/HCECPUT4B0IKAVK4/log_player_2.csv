"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $15,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $13,000 to make this work.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice came down $1000, which is a good sign, but we still have room to negotiate. Let's try to meet her halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're proposing a compromise by suggesting the middle ground between her last offer ($13,000) and our previous counteroffer ($10,000). This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $12,500 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering the value it brings.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating and moving closer to our desired price range, but we're only $500 away from John's price.  We can push a little further to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $12,100. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 12100
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're getting very close to our limit. Offering $12,100 puts us only $400 away from Alice's last offer and still saves us money compared to John.  By suggesting we're ready to close, we might encourage Alice to accept."
