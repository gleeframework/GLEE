"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is only worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $170. 
* **You have a better option.** You can buy the product from John for $100, so there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice, so rejecting her offer gives you a chance to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $170 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $120 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value-Based:**  $120 is above my maximum value ($100), but I'm willing to pay a little extra if it means securing the product without the hassle of John. 
* **Opportunity for Dialogue:**  The message emphasizes my interest in the product, making it more likely for Alice to consider my counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $145? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down from her original price, $145 is still above my maximum value of $100. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  I have 7 rounds left to continue negotiating, and I believe there's still room for Alice to lower her price. 
* **John is a backup:**  I can always buy from John for $100, so I'm not desperate to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go to $135?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm really keen on getting this product."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  Offering $135 is a smaller increment from Alice's last offer, suggesting a willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message reiterates my interest in the product and frames $135 as a fair compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer gauges Alice's flexibility and provides a chance for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $135 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $135, which would be $140. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too close to my limit:** While Alice has come down a bit, $140 is still significantly higher than my maximum value of $100.
* **Time is running out:**  We're now halfway through the negotiation rounds. I'm not confident I can get Alice down to my price range in the remaining time.
* **John is the best option:**  I can get the product from John for $100, which is a much better deal than anything Alice has offered.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
