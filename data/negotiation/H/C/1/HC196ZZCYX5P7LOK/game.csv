"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $170 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $145? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go to $135?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm really keen on getting this product.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $135, which would be $140. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",140.0,Alice,5,
