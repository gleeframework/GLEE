Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer slightly below your guaranteed price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
2. **Justification:**  Provide a reason for the price, even if it's just the product's value to you.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially valuing it at $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects its significant worth and the benefits it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is a strong opening, leaving room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""benefits,"" you're framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive starting price might be better."
