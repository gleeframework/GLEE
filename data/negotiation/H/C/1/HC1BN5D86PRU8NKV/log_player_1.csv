Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a great product, but I'm not sure if it's worth the full $1500000 to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
