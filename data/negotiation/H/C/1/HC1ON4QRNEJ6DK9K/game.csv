"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial proposal. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $975,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $975,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,000,000? This would be my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $987,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. If you're willing to accept this offer, I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",987500.0,Bob,6,
