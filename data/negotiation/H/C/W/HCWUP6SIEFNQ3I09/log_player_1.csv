Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $90, you're aiming for a price that is attractive to Bob (as it's below his perceived value) while maximizing your potential profit. 

This strategy leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down, but ensures you still make a significant profit even if you have to go with your backup buyer, John."
