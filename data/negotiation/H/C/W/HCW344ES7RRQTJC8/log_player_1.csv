Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves me the option to accept a counteroffer from Bob if he isn't willing to pay $140, or to walk away and sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to let it go for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
