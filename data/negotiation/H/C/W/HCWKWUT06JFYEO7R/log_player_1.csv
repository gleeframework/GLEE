{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is still a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price, especially since the product is worth significantly more to Bob. I have 9 rounds left to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000.  This still gives me a good return, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
