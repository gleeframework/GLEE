"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $18,000 is still too far from my budget. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit, so I'll offer it to you for $16,000. This is as low as I can go.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but $16,000 is still outside my budget. I can do $13,000, and I think that's a very reasonable offer.  If you can't do that, I might have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is my absolute lowest price. If you can accept that, we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,
