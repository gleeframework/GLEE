Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement). You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. This means you should accept no less than this amount from Bob.  While Bob values the product at $1,200,000, we don't know his walk-away point.  We can aim slightly higher than John's offer to see if we can get Bob to agree.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,550,000. I believe this reflects the significant benefits it offers and is a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Message:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value. 
* **The Price:** The price is slightly above your guaranteed offer from John, providing room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance, you might offer a price closer to John's offer or even higher."
