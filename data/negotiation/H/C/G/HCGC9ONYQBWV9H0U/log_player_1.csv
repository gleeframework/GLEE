Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a bit overpriced at $15,000, but I'm interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $13,500.  Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate towards a price closer to my initial offer. Accepting $12,750 is a good compromise, netting a profit of $2,750 over my minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result.
