"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value of the product ($10,000), indicating room for negotiation. While accepting would guarantee a profit, rejecting and countering strategically might yield a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is closer to what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $17,500?"", 
""product_price"": 17500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're aiming for a price higher than his offer but lower than our initial ask. This shows flexibility while still striving for a strong profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to come down to $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has incrementally increased his offer and is now at $16,000. While we could push for more, we are already above his perceived value and getting closer to the guaranteed $15,000 from John. Accepting minimizes risk and secures a good profit."
