Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get Bob closer to $1,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $975,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

We're getting close, but it's still worth holding out for a bit more. Let's see if Bob is willing to budge further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000.

While we didn't reach $1,000,000, $985,000 is a strong offer and significantly higher than John's $800,000. It's better to accept a good deal now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
