"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the benefits it can bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
