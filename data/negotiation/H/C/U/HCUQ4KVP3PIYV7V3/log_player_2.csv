"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his budget, and he has a better option with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  Since he has a guaranteed option of getting the product from John for $8,000, it's the most logical choice."
