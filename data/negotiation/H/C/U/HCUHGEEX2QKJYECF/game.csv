"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $8,500 is quite a bit lower than my minimum. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,750? This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,3,
