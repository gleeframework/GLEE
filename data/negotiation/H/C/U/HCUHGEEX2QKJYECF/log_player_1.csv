Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum price but still leaves you room for profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $9,000, which is a compromise between my minimum price of $10,000 and Bob's valuation of $8,000.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for both parties. It avoids being aggressive or demanding. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation without risking a quick rejection. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter-offer and potentially work towards a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $9,000, which would still leave him room for profit. Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, but I'd like to see if I can get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $8,500 is quite a bit lower than my minimum. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,750? This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $8,750, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. 
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while reiterating that my minimum price is higher. The message is still friendly and focused on finding a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Negotiation strategy:** This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired price but still attractive to Bob."
