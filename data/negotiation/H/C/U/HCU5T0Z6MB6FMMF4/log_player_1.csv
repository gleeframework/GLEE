Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $120 because it's lower than my minimum selling price of $150. I'll try to get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $170?  This is a great deal for a product like this, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 170}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum, I want to try and get a little more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $140 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $155, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 155}
