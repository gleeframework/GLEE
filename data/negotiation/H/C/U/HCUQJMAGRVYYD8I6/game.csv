,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $925,000.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $885,000.  This represents a significant gain for you and is a fair price for me.  Let's close this deal.",885000.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $915,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $895,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's end this negotiation on a positive note.",895000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $910,000. This is a very reasonable offer, considering the value of the product to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but no further.",910000.0,Alice,9,
