Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $11,500. I believe it will be very beneficial for you, and this price is a steal compared to its true value."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $8,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000.

**Strategy:**

1. **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price higher than your minimum but low enough that Bob might consider it.
2. **Create Urgency:** A ""limited time"" offer can encourage Bob to act quickly.
3. **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's ""true value"" aims to shift Bob's perception of the price.

**Why this offer might work:**

* **Psychological Pricing:** $11,500 feels significantly lower than a round $12,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts, you make a profit of $3,500, which is better than your guaranteed $0 profit if you sell to John.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he's very price-sensitive, he might reject it. However, this strategy gives you a chance to maximize your profit while still having John's offer as a safety net."
