"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there is still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the profit I'll make. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1,075,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to push for a price closer to $1,050,000 by making another counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to meet halfway again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,070,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and while Bob would prefer a lower price, accepting this offer is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. It saves Bob $130,000 compared to John's price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly lower price."
