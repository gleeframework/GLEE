"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the profit I'll make. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1,075,000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,075,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking to save a little more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,062,500? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to get a better price while still ensuring you receive a fair profit.",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,070,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1070000.0,Alice,5,
