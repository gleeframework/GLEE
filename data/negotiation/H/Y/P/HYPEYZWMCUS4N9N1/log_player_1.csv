{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $8,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leverage the potential for negotiation and secure a price closer to my minimum. I'm also framing it as a great deal to incentivize Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet.  I believe I can negotiate a better price, and I want to see if I can get him closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to come down to $8,200. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,200, which would be $7,850. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,850 is a good compromise and only slightly below my minimum.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000, and the negotiation process is likely to continue if I reject. Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids further haggling."
