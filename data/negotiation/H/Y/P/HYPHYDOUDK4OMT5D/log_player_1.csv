"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation.
* **High but Realistic:** While it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it's not so high that it's instantly rejected out of hand.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $650,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:** I can still negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Selling to John is a Backup:** While $1,000,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can do better with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**  I'll need to make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is unfortunately too far off for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $900,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the significant reduction I'm offering.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  $750,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is Progressing:**  We're getting closer, but I want to see if I can push for a better price.
* **John is a Safety Net:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is appealing, I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my ideal price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll make another counteroffer, trying to bridge the gap between our current positions."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair compromise given the product's value and my need to get a decent price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm reducing my offer again, but not by a large amount. This shows I'm committed to negotiating, but also that I'm not willing to undervalue the product.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a compromise to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency:** By suggesting a finalization of the deal, I'm subtly adding pressure to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll need to carefully consider my next move, weighing the potential of further negotiation with the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've come down quite a bit, and I respect that. I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000 to try and close this deal. This is my final offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer.  If I accept, I'm missing out on the potential for a better price.
* **John is a Strong Option:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a very attractive alternative at this point. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my ideal price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price. I'll need to be strategic, as I only have a few rounds left."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to move closer.  However, $775,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $825,000. This is a very fair price considering the product's value and the significant compromises I've made. This is my final offer.  I hope we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Compromise:** By offering a halfway point between our current positions, I show I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm reiterating the product's value and my previous concessions.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as I only have a few rounds left."
