"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $16000, which is a $2000 reduction from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14000. If you're not able to come down to that, I may have to look elsewhere.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on $14000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a price of $15500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer. This is my final offer in this range.",15500.0,Alice,5,
