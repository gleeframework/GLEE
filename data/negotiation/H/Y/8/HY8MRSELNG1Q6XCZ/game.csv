"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a purchase price of $750000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $750000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I've placed on the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
