# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I believe it's worth considering a price of $12,000, considering its worth to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice is overestimating how much the product is worth to you. There's room to negotiate or see if she'll lower the price with a counter-offer. If not, you can always buy from John for $15,000."
