Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some space for potential bargaining if Bob tries to negotiate. It's closer to his maximum value but still a significant profit for me. 
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:** While I could start higher, there's a risk of making Bob feel like I'm not negotiating in good faith. This price is a strong opening offer that shows I value his potential purchase.

This strategy balances maximizing my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
