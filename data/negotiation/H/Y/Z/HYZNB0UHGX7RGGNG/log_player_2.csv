Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $9,375 is getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is my minimum price. If you're willing to meet me there, I think we can finalize the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best possible outcome. Alice has reached her minimum price, and it's a good deal for you at $2,000 less than your maximum budget.  Continuing to negotiate could risk the deal entirely."
