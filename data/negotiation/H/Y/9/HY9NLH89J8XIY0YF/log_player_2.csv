"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget and he can get the product for less.  He should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own costs and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to charge a bit more than $12,000. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's already stated his budget is closer to $12,000, and $14,000 is still too high. He can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,500 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and your costs. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already met you at $13,500, Bob, and you're now asking me to go back to $13,000. I'm not willing to do that. I'm going to take a firmer stance and say that $14,000 is my minimum. I'm willing to hold firm on this price, but I'm also keeping the option to sell to John for $15,000 if we can't come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice is now being stubborn and unwilling to compromise further.  It's clear that he can get a better deal from John, and at this point, it's not worth risking more rounds of negotiation."
