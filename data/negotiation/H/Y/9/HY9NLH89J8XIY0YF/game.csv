"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own costs and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to charge a bit more than $12,000. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer on the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and your costs. Let's close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $13,500, Bob, and you're now asking me to go back to $13,000. I'm not willing to do that. I'm going to take a firmer stance and say that $14,000 is my minimum. I'm willing to hold firm on this price, but I'm also keeping the option to sell to John for $15,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,7,
