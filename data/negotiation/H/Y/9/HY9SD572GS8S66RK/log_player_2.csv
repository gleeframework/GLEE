{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows Bob's seriousness in negotiating and sets the stage for potential compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still not low enough for Bob to accept. There is still room for negotiation and a chance to get a better deal.  By rejecting, Bob continues to pressure Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer while still staying within his budget.  $1,050,000 is a compromise that shows Bob's willingness to meet Alice halfway, but it also pushes her towards a more favorable price for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, and $1,080,000 is a good deal for Bob. He's saved almost $420,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and refuse to negotiate further, or that another buyer will make a better offer.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids potential risks."
