"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more likely to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $9500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** It's early in the negotiation, and rejecting his offer keeps the bargaining power in my favor.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired price point.
* **Avoiding ""Sell to John"":**  Selling to John at this point would leave money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, $9,500 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,800.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-proposal to keep the negotiation moving.
* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, showing I'm willing to compromise but not drastically lowering my price.
* **Maintain Control:**  By offering a higher price, I keep the negotiation dynamic in my favor.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and collaborative tone to encourage further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $9600 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, there's still a gap. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Avoiding ""Sell to John"":** Selling to John at this point would be less profitable than continuing the negotiation with Bob.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him to increase his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,600 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,700. This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($9,800) and Bob's offer ($9,600). This demonstrates a commitment to compromise.
* **Strong Position:** I'm still holding out for a price higher than my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility.
* **Urgency:**  The message subtly suggests that this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $9650 for the product. I hope this proposal is closer to what you're hoping for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point. Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more, and I risk Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time Constraint:** With only four rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of reaching the end of the negotiation with no deal.
* **Avoiding ""Sell to John"":**  Selling to John for $8,000 would be significantly less than the $9,650 Bob is offering."
