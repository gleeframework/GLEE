{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $13,000 is above your minimum price of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a potential for Bob to counteroffer, allowing you to negotiate further.
* **It's competitive:** Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, $13,000 is a fair price for him to consider.

Remember, this is just the initial offer. You'll need to be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is still above my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to $13,000."

While $11,800 is still a decent profit for me, I'm not ready to sell at that price yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a slightly higher price.  I'm still hopeful that we can reach a compromise closer to my desired range."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and we're not making much progress.  His latest offer of $11,900 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can push him much higher.  Rather than continue a potentially lengthy and fruitless negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and allows me to move on."
