,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a good price point for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1250000 is still a little below my desired price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1275000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1275000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1225000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
