"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6,000 right now.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $7,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $6,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller profit margin. I'm offering it to you for $7,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",7200.0,Alice,5,
