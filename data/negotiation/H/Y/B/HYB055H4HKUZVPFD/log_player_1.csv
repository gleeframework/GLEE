Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) creates a sense of a good deal for Bob.
* **Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential ROI, justifying the price. 

By starting high, but still within a reasonable range for Bob, I increase my chances of:

1. **Bob Accepting:**  He gets the product at a price potentially lower than he expected.
2. **Negotiation Leverage:**  If Bob counters, there's room to negotiate down towards $1,500,000 and still secure a profit."
