"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. How about we settle at $7,750?  That's a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $7,750 is closer, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen - how about we meet in the middle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,6,
