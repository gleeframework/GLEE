{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial valuation, it's still above your maximum budget.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still within your budget. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and it shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is closer to your desired price point, and only slightly exceeds your budget. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price is significant.  It's better to secure the product at this price point to ensure you get it within your budget."
