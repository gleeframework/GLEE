Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're essentially in a no-lose situation. This allows you to aim high with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Even if Bob initially rejects this high offer, it opens the door for negotiation. You can always come down in price, moving closer to his $1,000,000 valuation while still aiming for a profit above your guaranteed sale."
