"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $100. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. It's a great compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $125? It's the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $118? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",118.0,Alice,7,
