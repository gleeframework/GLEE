,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
