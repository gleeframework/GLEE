Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By starting at $12,000, I have space to negotiate down if necessary without dropping below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I have a backup if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. 
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:** I believe I can get a higher price by counteroffering. There's still room to negotiate upwards without losing too much.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** This counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but still within a reasonable range, allowing for further negotiation. 
* **Showing flexibility:** By lowering my price, I'm showing willingness to compromise and make a deal.
* **Maintaining a comfortable margin:**  $10,500 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose too much money. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a positive tone, suggesting that we can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I'm still aiming to keep within my budget. I would like to propose $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with her valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is only $5,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price or a prolonged process. 
* **Guaranteed sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While John's offer is more lucrative, the guaranteed sale with Bob is a reasonable outcome considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
