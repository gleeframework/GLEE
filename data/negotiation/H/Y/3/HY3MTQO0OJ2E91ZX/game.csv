"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1200000. It's a high-quality item that's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1050000. This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's a fair offer considering the value of this product.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price, but I'm still a bit above $950000. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still not enough for me to part with this valuable product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup my investment. Let's settle this now and move forward with the transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $920000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",920000.0,Bob,6,
