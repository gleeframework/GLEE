"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a high-quality item that's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is high but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining my target of making a profit.  I'm setting the stage for a back-and-forth process that might lead to a successful deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a better price than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I have several rounds left, and I want to maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's a fair offer considering the value of this product.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price, but I'm still a bit above $950000. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my target, it's still below what I consider a reasonable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I have 6 rounds left and I want to maximize my profits.  The price John is offering is enticing, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not enough for me to part with this valuable product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup my investment. Let's settle this now and move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $920000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting down to the wire.  While Bob is offering a price closer to my minimum, I've reached a point where I'm willing to accept John's offer for $1,000,000. The risk of continuing with Bob is too high, and the chance of him agreeing to my price in the remaining rounds is slim. I'm better off securing the deal with John and guaranteeing a profit."
