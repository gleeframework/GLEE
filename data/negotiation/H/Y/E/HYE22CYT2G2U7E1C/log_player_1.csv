Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone (""I think you'd really appreciate it"") can help build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at my absolute maximum price, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Remember, I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This allows me to be more assertive during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $150 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, so there's no reason to continue negotiation. 
* **No Risk:** By accepting his offer, I avoid the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and potentially walking away, leaving me with no sale. 
* **John's Value:** While I could potentially get a higher price from John, the certainty of a sale at my minimum price with Bob is the most beneficial option."
