"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget considerations.  However, the $950,000 offer falls short of reflecting the true value this product holds.  I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise, and I believe it represents a mutually beneficial opportunity.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to move from your initial price. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget of $800,000.

I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
