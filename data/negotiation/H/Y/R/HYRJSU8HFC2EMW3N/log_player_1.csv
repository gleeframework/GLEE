Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a strong offer that leans closer to your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm stance on the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,100,000, Alice signals willingness to negotiate but avoids drastically undervaluing the product. This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while staying above his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has the security of John's offer ($1,200,000), giving her leverage. If Bob's counteroffers don't meet her expectations, she can walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant increase from his initial valuation, it's still considerably lower than both Alice's asking price and John's guaranteed offer. Alice has room to negotiate further and should aim to secure a price closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget considerations.  However, the $950,000 offer falls short of reflecting the true value this product holds.  I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise, and I believe it represents a mutually beneficial opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice is demonstrating flexibility by lowering her price by $50,000, encouraging Bob to reciprocate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The counteroffer of $1,050,000 keeps the negotiation significantly above Bob's initial offer while staying closer to Alice's desired range. 
* **Open Communication:** By clearly explaining her rationale and reiterating the product's value, Alice aims to keep the negotiation collaborative and solutions-oriented."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to move from your initial price. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget of $800,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a strong compromise. While it's still less than Alice's ideal price and John's guaranteed offer, it represents a significant profit above Bob's initial valuation and Alice's minimum acceptable price.  

Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Strong Return:** $1,000,000 is a substantial sum and ensures a healthy profit for Alice. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Extended negotiations can be draining. Accepting a reasonable offer allows both parties to move forward. 

While John's offer is higher, the difference of $200,000 isn't worth risking the possibility of Bob walking away entirely.  Accepting $1,000,000 is a pragmatic and profitable decision."
