"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product. This leaves room for negotiation and avoids a quick rejection.
* **Value for both sides:** The offer is well above my minimum price of $800,000, ensuring I'm comfortable with the outcome if Bob accepts. It's also a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, making it appealing for him. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further.
* If the negotiations become unproductive, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $800,000, guaranteeing a profit."

**Next Steps:**
