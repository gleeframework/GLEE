Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love!  I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and above what I know the product is worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to make the offer more appealing to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message explicitly indicates that the price is negotiable, inviting Bob to counteroffer.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by countering Bob's offer. 
* **John is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for $100, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to secure a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a great price for a fantastic product! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's in the middle of my minimum ($100) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** I'm using a positive tone and encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is great, subtly emphasizing its worth.

This counteroffer aims to reach a compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $90? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'd only get $100 from John.
* **Time factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.

Given the close proximity to my minimum and the risk of losing the deal, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most reasonable choice at this point."
