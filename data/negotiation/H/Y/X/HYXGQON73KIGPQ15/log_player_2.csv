"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to potentially get a lower price.  It's a gamble, but the potential savings outweigh the risk in this scenario."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to land somewhere in the middle between my maximum budget and Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating, but also gives her room to counter without losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000.  There's still room to negotiate, and I can potentially get a better price with another counteroffer. While I'm close to John's price, the risk of getting a better deal with Alice is worth taking."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to drastically lower my offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
