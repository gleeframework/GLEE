"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $140.  If you're not comfortable with that, I might have to look at other options.",140.0,Bob,4,
