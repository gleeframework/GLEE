Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always better to start negotiations higher to allow room for bargaining. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Bob values the product at $800,000, and I value it at a minimum of $1,500,000. Offering it at $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **Confidence and Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential returns"" to justify the high price without revealing my guaranteed buyer.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might be willing to negotiate the price slightly. However, I wouldn't go below $1,500,000 as I have a guaranteed buyer at that price."
