Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for bargaining. I'm optimistic that Bob might be willing to pay more, but I'm prepared to counter his offers if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more. I'll counter his offer and try to find a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? Let's see if we can find a price we're both comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. How about $110? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay under $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and is within my desired range.  It's better than selling to John for $100, and continuing the negotiation might lead to a lower price for me.  Accepting this offer is the best option."
