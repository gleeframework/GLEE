"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you.  I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  It's something I've personally valued at no less than $1,000,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000.  This is a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
