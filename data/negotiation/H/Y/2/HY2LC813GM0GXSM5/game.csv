"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, it's below the value I need to secure for this product.  Considering the potential benefits for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a strong investment for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
