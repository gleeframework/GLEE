"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. I believe it's a valuable asset that can benefit your business greatly. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,250,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will prove to be a wise investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's a good deal for her, it doesn't make sense for you to accept it. Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, it's below the value I need to secure for this product.  Considering the potential benefits for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a strong investment for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above your maximum budget. While it's closer, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000.  It's better to secure the product at that price rather than potentially getting caught in a longer back-and-forth with Alice."
