Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $10,000, I'm setting a high anchor price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards without feeling like I'm losing too much.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob, implying it could be worth more than my asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to buy for $8,000 gives me a floor for negotiations and ensures I won't settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Upside:**  While I could try to counteroffer, there's no guarantee Bob will budge. 
* **Time is Money:**  Delaying the sale risks Bob changing his mind or finding another option.  
* **John as a Backup:** If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for the same price. However, there's no guarantee that John will be available or willing to buy in the future.

It's better to secure the sale now and avoid any potential complications."
