"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response! I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fantastic deal for a product of this quality.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to a fair deal, so my final offer is $14,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's a great deal for a product you won't find elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,5,
