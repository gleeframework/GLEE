"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my price range.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum value.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product holds significantly more value for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

* **Maintaining negotiation leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation moving and gives you more power to influence the final price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects both our positions and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I respect your approach to this negotiation, so I'm willing to consider a slight adjustment to my previous offer. How about $1,175,000? I think this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your perspective.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```
