"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, it's a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $800,000 to make it work.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider my own profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm really eager to get this product, but I can't go higher than $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $925,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit too high. I'm firm on my maximum of $875,000. It's a fair price that gives us both a good outcome. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're getting closer to your minimum, but I'm still aiming to get a better price. I'm sticking to my maximum offer of $875,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be honest with you, I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000, and that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,9,
