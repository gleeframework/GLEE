"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to make a fair profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",9000.0,Bob,4,
