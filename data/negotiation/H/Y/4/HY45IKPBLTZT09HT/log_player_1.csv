{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I am potentially making a profit, but I also leave room for negotiation.  I want to make sure Bob knows I am serious about selling the product, but I'm not giving it away.  By starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to him, I allow for the possibility of a counteroffer.  I'll then need to decide whether to accept his counteroffer, or if I want to make a counteroffer myself.  However, I also have John as a backup buyer, so I won't be pressured into accepting a price lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm not willing to accept it.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, but also consider the fact that John is willing to pay $10,000.  I need to strike a balance between getting the best price possible and not risking losing the deal to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering Bob a price that is closer to my minimum but still gives him some room to negotiate. This way I can potentially close the deal at a price that is more beneficial to me, but I'm still keeping John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to make a fair profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close enough to my minimum price that I'm willing to accept it. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal to John. This is a good compromise and allows me to sell the product for a price that is still profitable for me."
