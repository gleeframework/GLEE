"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget and $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $9,750? That's the highest I can go.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $9,750. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,750. I can offer it to you for $10,125. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10125.0,Alice,5,
