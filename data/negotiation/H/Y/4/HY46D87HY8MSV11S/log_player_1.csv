Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique and valuable item, and I believe this is a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than the minimum I'd accept ($10,000) to see if I can get a better deal. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build rapport with Bob.  

Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $12000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to counter-offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for something closer to my asking price.  How about $13,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing that I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Let's see if Bob is willing to budge!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the value of the product, I would like to propose $13000 as the purchase price. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,000 is a good deal and represents a significant increase from my minimum acceptable price.  It's also a fair compromise considering the current market conditions.  

It's important to recognize that continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer, potentially leading to a lower offer from John or even no sale at all."
