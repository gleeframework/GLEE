Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, we can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing specifics that Bob could use to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still well above our guaranteed price.
* **Confidence:** The tone of the message is confident and positive, suggesting that this is a desirable product worth the asking price. 
 
It's important to remember that this is just an opening move. Depending on Bob's response, we might need to adjust our strategy and potentially lower the price during the negotiation."
