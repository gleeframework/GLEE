"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly less than his maximum budget of $1,500,000 and allows him to save $100,000. There's no guarantee that he can get a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice, and buying from John would cost him more."
