{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is above your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows that you're serious about selling, but also sets a high initial price. 

Depending on Bob's response, you can adjust your strategy. If he rejects, you can consider lowering your price slightly, but keep in mind John's offer of $10,000 as your floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer. You want to see if you can push for a higher price. Rejecting his offer will allow you to make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a price closer to your initial goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet at $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your product's worth, Alice.  How about $10,900? That's a significant move on my part, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,900 is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to your initial asking price of $11,500 and still above your minimum of $10,000.  Accepting his offer secures a good profit for you while also closing the deal."
