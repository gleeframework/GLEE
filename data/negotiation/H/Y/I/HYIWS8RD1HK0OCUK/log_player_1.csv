"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'll need to assess his response and adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take $650,000, it's significantly less than the product's worth to me and what I could get from John. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $725,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below the $800,000 I could get from John. I'm not willing to settle for less, and I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $725,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $762,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 762500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $740,000.  This is a competitive offer considering my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below the $800,000 I could get from John. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure there's enough time to get Bob to meet my price. It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John and move on."
