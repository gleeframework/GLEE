"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $13,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. However, $13,000 is a bit above what I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I had a higher price in mind, I'm willing to come down a bit. Would you consider $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $15,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John."
