"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  $15,000 is a bit too high for me, would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm targeting something closer to $7,000.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your counter.  I'm motivated to sell, but $7,000 is too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to do $9,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Alice,5,
