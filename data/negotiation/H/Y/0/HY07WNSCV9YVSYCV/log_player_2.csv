# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. I've come down significantly from my initial price. $1,475,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  If you're truly interested in this product, I urge you to take this offer. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to another buyer.

This is a tough one, but Alice is clearly getting firm and her final offer is only slightly above John's price.  Continuing to push her risks losing the deal entirely, and at this point, saving $25,000 might not be worth it."
