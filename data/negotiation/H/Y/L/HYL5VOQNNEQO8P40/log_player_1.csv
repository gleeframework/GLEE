Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you profit from the sale. If Bob rejects, you can fall back on selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
