I'm starting with a fairly low counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly.  $7,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for compromise while still being within my budget."

I'm increasing my offer to $9,000. This is a more significant step towards Alice's price, showing that I'm serious about getting a deal. It's still within my budget, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a reasonable compromise."
