{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to see if he's willing to pay closer to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell it for significantly less than my minimum.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $85? That's the maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $85 is within my minimum range and is a reasonable compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $100, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
