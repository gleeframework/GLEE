Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
 
I'm starting high, as there's room to negotiate down to his valuation of $120.  This gives me the best chance to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130} 

I'm aiming to get closer to my minimum while still leaving some space for negotiation in case Bob pushes back again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  If you're not willing to budge any further, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob is signaling that $115 is his final offer. While it's not ideal, it's better to accept than risk losing the sale altogether."
