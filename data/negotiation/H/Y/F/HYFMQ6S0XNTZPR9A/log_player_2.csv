# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down to a price closer to your $10,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still leaves you with a good value, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let me know if you're interested in this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

While Alice's offer is closer to your limit, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  You can counteroffer again, hoping to reach a price closer to your target of $10,000."
