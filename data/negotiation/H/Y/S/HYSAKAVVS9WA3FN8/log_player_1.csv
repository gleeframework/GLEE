Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my desired price point. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can nudge him a bit higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,350,000?  This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,325,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

Bob is clearly committed to purchasing the product and has incrementally increased his offer.  Accepting his final offer of $1,325,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether."
