"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose specifics at this time, I'm confident it could be worth much more than $1000000 to the right person. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a one-time offer, and I'm sure you'll agree this represents an exceptional value. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
