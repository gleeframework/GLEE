Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $600,000 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to go up to $700,000, which I believe is a fair price given the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value to you is even higher than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $725,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 725000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $710,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to sell quickly and me to acquire a valuable asset within my budget. Let's aim for a final agreement this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $710,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $720,000.
