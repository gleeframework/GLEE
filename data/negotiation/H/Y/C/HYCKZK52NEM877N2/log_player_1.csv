**Reasoning:**

While ideally, we want a price closer to $1,200,000, Bob has now hit his maximum price. He's aware of John and is using that as leverage.  Accepting his offer of $1,000,000 is the best decision at this point for these reasons:

* **Avoids Risk:** Continuing negotiations risks losing Bob entirely. He might walk away, leaving us to accept John's offer, which is the same as Bob's current offer. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  A deal today is worth more than the same deal later. Accepting now avoids potential delays and secures the funds.

In summary, while not ideal, accepting Bob's $1,000,000 offer mitigates risk and secures a reasonable profit."
