"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, which I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the perceived value of the product. While $9,500 is less than your $12,000 maximum, you know you have a backup option with John. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her $8,000 valuation."
