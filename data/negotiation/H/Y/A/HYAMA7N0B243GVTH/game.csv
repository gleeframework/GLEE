"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. Considering the product's value to you is $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $11000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11000, which would be $10000. I'd like to propose a final offer of $10000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
