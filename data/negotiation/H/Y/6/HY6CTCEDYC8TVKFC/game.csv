"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its potential value to me.  This is a fair price, allowing you to make a profit while still remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a significant gap from where I see the product's value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the true worth of the product and its potential benefits.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand you're trying to maximize your profit, $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm comfortable with $950,000, which allows both of us to gain from this deal. This offer considers the product's value and my financial limitations. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to consider $1,250,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal. However, I do have other interested buyers, and I need to be realistic about the value of this product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate your compromise. While $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This offer demonstrates my genuine interest in the product and reflects a fair middle ground. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
