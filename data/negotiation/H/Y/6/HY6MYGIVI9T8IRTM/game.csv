"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value you'll get from owning this product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product while also allowing for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit margin. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This would be a significant savings for me while still providing you with a substantial profit. Let's work together to bridge the remaining gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than my original offer, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
