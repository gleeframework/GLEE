"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $65 is a good price, but it's still significantly lower than my maximum value of $120.
* There's potential to negotiate further and get an even better deal. 
* It's early in the negotiation, so there's less risk in rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* $50 is still a good deal for me, and it leaves room for potential compromise.
* By offering a lower price, I'm hoping to get Alice to counter at a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to my desired price.
* $60 is a good deal for me, and it's within my budget.
*  There's no guarantee that I can get a lower price in future rounds, especially with limited rounds remaining."
