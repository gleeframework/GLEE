"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a little high for my budget, would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the best I can do at this point.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $8,000, but that's my absolute limit.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,000. However, I'm still not at my minimum price. I'm willing to go up to $11,000 to make a deal happen. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,7,
