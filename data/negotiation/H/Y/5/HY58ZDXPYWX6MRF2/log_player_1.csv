Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum value of $100, leaving room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a reasonable price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering I'm close to my minimum acceptable price.  The risk of further negotiation could lead to Bob walking away, and I'd be forced to sell to John at a lower price."
