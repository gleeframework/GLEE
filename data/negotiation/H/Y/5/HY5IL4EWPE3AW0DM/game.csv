"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $102 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",102.0,Alice,5,
