Alice's offer is too high. We know we can get it cheaper, either by negotiating with Alice further or going with John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

We're getting closer, but $105 is still above our target price. We have room to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $95.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $102 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is within our acceptable range. It's better to accept a good deal now than risk the negotiation breaking down."
