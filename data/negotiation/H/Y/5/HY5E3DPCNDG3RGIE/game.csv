,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I appreciate your position, but I'm looking for a little bit more than $11,500. Would you be willing to go up to $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $13,000 is still a touch high for me. Would you consider $12,500? This would be a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,6,
