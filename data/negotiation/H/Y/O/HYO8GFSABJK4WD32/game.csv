"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget.  Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  While I'm eager to acquire this product, I can't go higher than $950,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering my budget and the value you place on the product.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
