{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $882,500.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal, and I'm running out of time.  I'm also worried that if I reject his offer, he might walk away entirely, and I'd be left with the lower offer from John.  $882,500 is still a significant profit for me, and I'm happy to close the deal at this price."
