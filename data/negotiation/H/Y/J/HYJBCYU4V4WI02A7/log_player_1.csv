Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. It's a steal for someone who values its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $20,000 is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's worth to you creates an impression of value for Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question encourages Bob to engage in a discussion and potentially make a counteroffer.

**Strategy:** 

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I can gauge Bob's interest and maximize my potential earnings. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $15000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum:**  Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept it, I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal. 
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counter-offer.  This keeps the negotiation open and gives me a chance to see if I can get closer to my ideal price. 
* **No Pressure to Sell:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob is willing to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counter-offer to Bob, likely somewhere between $15,000 and $20,000, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget, I'm looking for something a little closer to my initial price.  Would you consider $17,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it helps me recover some of the value I've put into this product."", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  $17,500 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give away too much.
* **Value Justification:**  I reiterate the value of the product to emphasize that $17,500 is still a good deal.
* **Direct Appeal:**  The message is direct and to the point, focusing on a specific price.

**Strategy:**

By making a counter-offer closer to my desired price, I hope to get Bob to reconsider and potentially come closer to $17,500.  If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to accept his offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not able to meet you at $17500. Would you consider $16000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is very close to my ideal price of $17,500. It's a good deal, considering my minimum value is $15,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a lower price, or Bob could reject my next counteroffer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, which is important to me as I have a backup buyer in John.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer $17,500, accepting Bob's offer at $16,000 is a smart decision. It maximizes my profit while also securing a sale."
