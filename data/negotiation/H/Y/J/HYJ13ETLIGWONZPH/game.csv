"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the product's current market value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits and my willingness to close the deal quickly. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the valuation, however,  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects a more accurate value while still acknowledging your interest. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer $1,550,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my need to stay within budget.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
