Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it for the full $1,000,000 might discourage Bob. A slightly lower price shows a willingness to make a deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed $800,000 offer from John gives you leverage. You're not desperate, so you can aim high with Bob."
