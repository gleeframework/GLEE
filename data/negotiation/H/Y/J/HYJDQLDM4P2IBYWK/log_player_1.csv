"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to see if I can get a better price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you at $13500. That's my final offer. Can you accept it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's more than John's offer, and it ensures I don't have to go through any more rounds of negotiation."
