"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $8,000 from John.  Alice's offer is too high, even though it's a good deal for her. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you valuing the product at $12,000. However,  $10,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's still higher than John's price, but significantly lower than Alice's offer. This shows I'm interested in the product but want a better deal. It also leaves room for negotiation if Alice isn't happy with this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still higher than what I can get from John for $8,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a higher price. It's best to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
