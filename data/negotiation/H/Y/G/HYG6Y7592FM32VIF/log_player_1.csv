"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to the maximum Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Win-Win:**  Highlighting it's a ""great deal"" for both of us helps build trust and makes the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $12,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I can aim for a higher price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'll use the remaining rounds to try and get closer to my desired price point.  
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appeal to Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him helps justify the price.
* **Positive and Collaborative:**  My message emphasizes finding a solution together,  encouraging Bob to come closer to my offer."
