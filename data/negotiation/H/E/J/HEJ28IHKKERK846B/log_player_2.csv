"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his $12,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  Offering $13,000 is a reasonable counteroffer. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and a good starting point for further negotiation.
* **Clear Communication:** The message emphasizes Bob's desire to save money and shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Strategic Move:**  This counteroffer keeps Bob's options open. If Alice rejects, he can make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $12,000 target. While $13,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open to potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,250. This is a fair compromise that would allow us to both make a deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Close to Target:** This counteroffer keeps Bob close to his $12,000 target while still showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Small Increment:** The small increase from the previous counteroffer demonstrates a gradual approach and signals that Bob is serious about finding a solution.
* **Fair Compromise:** The message emphasizes the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Alice's sense of reason and potentially leading to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I can't go any lower than $13,400. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  While $13,400 is closer to Bob's $12,000 target, it's still a significant overpayment for Bob.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying more than he wants.
* **Guaranteed Savings:**  By buying from John, Bob can secure the product at his desired price and avoid further negotiation. This decision ensures Bob gets the best possible deal."
