"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,250. This is a fair compromise that would allow us to both make a deal.",13250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I can't go any lower than $13,400. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident you won't regret it.",13400.0,Alice,5,
