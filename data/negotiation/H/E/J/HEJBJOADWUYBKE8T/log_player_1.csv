Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob first is key to maximizing potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still offers him a substantial saving compared to our guaranteed sale price. This creates a potential win-win scenario.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer doesn't have to be the final price. It leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potential agreement closer to our desired outcome.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy.  In a multi-round negotiation, we could adjust our approach based on Bob's response to this initial offer."
