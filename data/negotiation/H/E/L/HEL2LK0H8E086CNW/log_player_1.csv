"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This initial offer sets a strong baseline and allows room for negotiation. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I'm willing to negotiate but not give away too much in the early stages."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe there's still potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for profit and shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe this price is fair and might be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get more, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure the sale now and avoid further risk."
