Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider adjusting the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, I still can't meet you halfway at $10,000. My maximum budget remains $8,000. Could we find a compromise within my price range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $8,000 offer.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount, it's in my best interest to cut my losses in this negotiation and sell to John. Further haggling with Bob is unlikely to yield a better outcome."
