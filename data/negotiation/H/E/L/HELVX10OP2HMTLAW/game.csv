"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1500000.  I'm confident it holds great value for you as well. Let's discuss this further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1000000 is a significant value, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low at this stage.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1250000? This would allow us both to find some common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still think $1250000 is a bit too high. How about we try $1125000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
