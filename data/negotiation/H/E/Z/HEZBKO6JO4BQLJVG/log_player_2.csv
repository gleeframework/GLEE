"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a fantastic deal, as you know the value is much higher. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Even though Alice is pressuring you, $14,500 is still more than you want to pay. You know John will sell it to you for $15,000. There's a chance Alice might come down on her price, making a rejection the best move."
