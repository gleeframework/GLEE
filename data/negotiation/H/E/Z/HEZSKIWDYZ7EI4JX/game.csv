"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more to the right buyer.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,875? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
