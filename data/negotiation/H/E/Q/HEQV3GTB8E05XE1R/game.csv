"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. This is a fair price considering your cost and my desired price point. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $950000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value it holds for you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can seal the deal!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1000000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and for you to secure a profitable sale. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial outcome.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking that $1050000 is a sweet spot that balances our interests. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
