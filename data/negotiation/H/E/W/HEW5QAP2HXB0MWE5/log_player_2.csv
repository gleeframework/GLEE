"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  He has room to negotiate since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $15,000 to Bob.  A counter-offer allows Bob to explore a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counter-offer, hoping to secure a price closer to Alice's perceived value. This is a bold move, but it demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position to negotiate.  $11,500 is closer to Alice's value than John's price, but Bob can still potentially secure a better deal by counter-offering again.  The goal is to find a price that's fair for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still trying to manage my budget, and I can offer $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible. By counter-offering at $11,000, he is showing that he is willing to negotiate but is also firm in his stance. This price is closer to Alice's counter-offer but still represents a significant savings for Bob compared to John's price. This move allows for a potential agreement without compromising too much on Bob's side."
