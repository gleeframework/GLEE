I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $13,000 is a good compromise and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer. I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob altogether."
