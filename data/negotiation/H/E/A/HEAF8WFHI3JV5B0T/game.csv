"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $130. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the benefits it brings. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $130. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you the product for $125. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
