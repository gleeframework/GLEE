Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $13,000 feels fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
