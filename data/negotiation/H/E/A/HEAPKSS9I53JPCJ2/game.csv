"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be more reasonable.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget.  Could you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
