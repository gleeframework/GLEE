"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a new offer of $13,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,
