"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $112? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",112.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $108 is still a little too low for me. How about we settle on $110? It's a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll still find it a worthwhile purchase.",110.0,Alice,5,
