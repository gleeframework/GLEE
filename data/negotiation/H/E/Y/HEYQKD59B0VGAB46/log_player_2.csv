Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

While $160 is closer to my target, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
