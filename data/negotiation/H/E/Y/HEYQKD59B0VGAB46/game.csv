"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this work.",160.0,Alice,3,
