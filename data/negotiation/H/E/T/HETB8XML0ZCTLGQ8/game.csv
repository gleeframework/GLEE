"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1350000. This price reflects the product's value and rarity, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1300000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1325000. This price reflects the product's value and rarity, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1312500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1325000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. What are your thoughts?",1325000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to a mutually agreeable price. If not, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1000000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your transparency about considering selling to John, Alice. That gives me a bit more confidence in my negotiation position. I'm willing to meet you at $1295000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget.",1295000.0,Bob,10,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1295000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $1300000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm only doing this because I value our negotiation and the potential partnership. If this doesn't work, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $1000000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,11,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the potential partnership, Alice, but I'm not willing to go back to $1300000. I'm willing to meet you at $1292500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget.",1292500.0,Bob,12,
