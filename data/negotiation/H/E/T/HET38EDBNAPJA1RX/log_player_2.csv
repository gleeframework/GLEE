Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it, given its value to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal compared to the $1000000 I could get from another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating to potentially reach a price closer to his $800,000 maximum."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to pay $862,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gain from other buyers."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $862500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $887500? It's still a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further. It's important to remember that Bob can always choose to buy from John if the negotiations don't go his way."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $887,500 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  Let's try $850,000 again.
