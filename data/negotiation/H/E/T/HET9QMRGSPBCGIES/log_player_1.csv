Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a good balance between a fair price and a profitable sale for me."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000.

This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit margin."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm working with a tight budget and $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle on $9,000?  That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000.
