Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still landing you a profit above your guaranteed sale.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John. If Bob knows your bottom line, this approach might backfire."
