"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer matches my absolute bottom line, I know the product is worth significantly more to him. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and capture some of that value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $1,250,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm still aiming higher. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so I'll push a bit further before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,275,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a slightly higher price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the best deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,275,000, so how about $1,262,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,262,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,262,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob is clearly committed to negotiating and this offer is a reasonable gain above my guaranteed sale price.  It's time to close the deal."
