"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $1,250,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,275,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a slightly higher price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the best deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,275,000, so how about $1,262,500?",1262500.0,Bob,6,
