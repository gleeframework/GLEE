"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, but not going too low. This allows room for negotiation and leaves a decent margin for Alice to still make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth a lot to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is closer to his target, it's still above his ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue aiming for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. How about $8,750?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to save some money."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a slight increase from his previous offer, showing he's willing to negotiate.  $8,750 is still significantly lower than Alice's original offer, but higher than his initial offer. This shows a willingness to compromise, but still prioritize saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $8,900 is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is getting closer to Bob's desired price and is a good deal considering the alternative of buying from John for $10,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much more, and there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and saves $1,100 compared to buying from John."
