Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth in the market. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $19,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a higher profit than John's offer. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, with a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's strategically sound to see if you can secure a better deal."
