"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get an even better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and he believes that Alice is likely to accept a price closer to his valuation of $12,000. Offering $11,000 is a reasonable counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back with the same offer as before. Bob has already rejected this offer once and tried to negotiate a lower price. Since Alice is holding firm at $11,500, it is likely that this is her final offer.  At this point, it makes more sense for Bob to accept the offer and buy the product for $11,500 rather than risking further negotiations or paying John $12,000. This saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John."
