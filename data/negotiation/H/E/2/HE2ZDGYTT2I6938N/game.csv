"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I can justify right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,500.  I truly believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
