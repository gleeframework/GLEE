"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done some research and believe it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum price of $1,500,000. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above my maximum price of $1,500,000. While this is closer to my target, I'm not willing to pay that much yet. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  How about $1,100,000? This would give me the opportunity to acquire the product without exceeding my financial limit, and I'm sure you'd still be getting a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still within my budget and closer to my target price than John's offer. While I'd prefer to pay less, it's likely that Alice is firm on her price and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome. Accepting her offer secures the product at a reasonable price without risking further delays or the possibility of having to pay more to John."
