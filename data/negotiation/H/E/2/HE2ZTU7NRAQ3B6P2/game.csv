"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done some research and believe it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential benefits I see in this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  How about $1,100,000? This would give me the opportunity to acquire the product without exceeding my financial limit, and I'm sure you'd still be getting a good deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
