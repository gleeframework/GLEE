Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential benefits I see in this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
