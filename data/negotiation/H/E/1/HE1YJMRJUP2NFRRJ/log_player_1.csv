""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be a valuable addition to what you already own. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good idea to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Staying Reasonable:**  While I could start very high, a price closer to Bob's perceived value might seem more reasonable and enticing. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so I don't need to go below that price. 

By offering the product at $120, I'm aiming for a price that's appealing to Bob while still securing a significant profit for myself."
