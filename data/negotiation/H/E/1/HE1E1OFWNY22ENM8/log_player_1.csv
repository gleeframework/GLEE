Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and allows me to make a good profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $15,000 to him, so he might be willing to pay a bit more. This leaves room for you to potentially increase the price if he counteroffers.
* **It's a fair starting point:** The offer is not too aggressive, giving Bob the feeling that you're open to negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to reach a deal with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you can always adjust it based on his counteroffer or go with John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is still above your minimum, it's a significant drop from your initial offer. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. Bob clearly values the product highly and is willing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, you can keep the momentum and potentially secure a price closer to your desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Offering $11,000 represents a compromise between your initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining a profit:**  $11,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a good profit.
* **Clear and concise message:** The message is clear, concise, and focuses on the benefits of the offer for both parties. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still positioning you in a strong position to achieve a favorable outcome."
