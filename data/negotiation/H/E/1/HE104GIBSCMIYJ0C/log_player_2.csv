"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about $90 for this exceptional product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's below your $100 limit, but you'd like to get a better deal if possible. 
* **You're still early in the negotiation.** There's plenty of time to try and push for a lower price. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round. Aim for a price closer to your $100 limit, but still below Alice's $120 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to pay $95 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within your range:**  $95 is still below your $100 limit, but it shows Alice you're serious about buying.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** It's a smaller step down from Alice's offer, suggesting you're willing to negotiate but also have a limit.
* **Positive tone:** The message emphasizes a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price and close the deal quickly."
