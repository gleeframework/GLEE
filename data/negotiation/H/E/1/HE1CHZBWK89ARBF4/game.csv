"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,075,000. How about we try $1,062,500?",1062500.0,Alice,5,
