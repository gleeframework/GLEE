"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and friendly tone is important for building rapport and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the value of the product without explicitly stating its worth to me. This might make Bob more inclined to meet me halfway. 

**Strategy:**  

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while acknowledging the possibility of Bob rejecting my initial offer. By offering a higher price, I can then potentially negotiate down to a price closer to my goal. I'm also keeping the door open to selling to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While I'm not willing to accept his offer, I see potential for negotiation. Bob has shown interest in the product, and his counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a better price. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to reach a compromise.  I'm still open to selling to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 isn't quite what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a counter offer of $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Reasoning:** By proposing a compromise, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the benefit of the deal for Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept. If he doesn't, I'll have more information to work with in the next round. I'm still willing to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and its value to you. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer Matches My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 aligns with my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Negotiation:**  While I'd love to get more, I'm satisfied with this price. It's the best I can expect from Bob given his stated budget. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price in the next round, and I risk losing the deal altogether. 

**Strategy:** 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum price and avoid the potential of further negotiation and potential rejection. This is the most sensible option considering my minimum price and the current stage of the negotiation."
