"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 isn't quite what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and its value to you. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
