Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to what I want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering a price of $160, which is still higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, it's in my best interest to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
