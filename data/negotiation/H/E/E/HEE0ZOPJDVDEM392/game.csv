"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product for a great price, and I get to sell it to someone who I think will appreciate it. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,1,
