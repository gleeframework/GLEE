"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's true value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $975,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you. I believe this is a fair price and a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,012,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you. I believe this is a fair price and a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
