# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm willing to make another concession.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,012,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you. I believe this is a fair price and a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $1,000,000.  While we might be able to squeeze a tiny bit more out of her, it's unlikely to be a significant amount. Accepting at $1,012,500 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of her pulling out of the negotiation entirely."
