"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we bring the price down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to bring the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Perhaps we could agree on $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to a dealbreaker for me.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $950,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. How about we discuss a price of $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
