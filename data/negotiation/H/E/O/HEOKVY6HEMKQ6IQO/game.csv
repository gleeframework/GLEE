"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,200,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
