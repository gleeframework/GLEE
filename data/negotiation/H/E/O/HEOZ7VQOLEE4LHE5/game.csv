"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $13,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,200.
