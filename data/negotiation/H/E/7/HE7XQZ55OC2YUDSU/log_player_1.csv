Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Value:** Your minimum acceptable price is $12,000.
* **John's Value:** John is willing to pay $12,000.

By offering $14,000, I am aiming to split the difference between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob a good deal and ensures I earn more than selling to John."
