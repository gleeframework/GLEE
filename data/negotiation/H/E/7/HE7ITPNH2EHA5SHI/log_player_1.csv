Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000.  This is a time-sensitive offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price close to your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. While Bob might not pay this, it makes lower offers seem more reasonable.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,450,000 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially prevents him from overthinking or shopping around.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how much Bob is *willing* to pay, only the product's worth to him ($800,000). This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer somewhat appealing to Bob.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** The safety net of John's offer allows Alice to be more confident in setting a high initial price."
