,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This gives you a good deal, and I'm still able to make a decent profit.  Let's try to close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $850,000 is still not enough for me. I'm offering $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us. I'm not willing to go any lower, so let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here. I'm offering a final price of $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and if you reject this, I'm going to sell the product to John. Let's close this deal now.",875000.0,Alice,7,
