"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to see a price closer to $600,000 to make it work.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $700,000? I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
