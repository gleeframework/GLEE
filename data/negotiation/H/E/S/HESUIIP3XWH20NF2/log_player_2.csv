"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price, allowing you to save even more."
