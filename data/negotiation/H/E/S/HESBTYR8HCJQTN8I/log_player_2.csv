Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is a fair compromise, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still slightly above your budget, and you've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  It's likely that further negotiations will result in a price that's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John at $8,000 and avoid the risk of further haggling."
