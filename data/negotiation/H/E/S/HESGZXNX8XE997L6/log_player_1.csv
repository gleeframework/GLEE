Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me ($800,000) and to Bob ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary while still earning a profit. I'm confident that Bob will find the value of the product worth paying a little extra for, given his own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I believe I can still secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000, which is halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates the product's value.  I believe this is a fair price that could lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to earn more, Bob's offer is close to my minimum. However,  I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price by continuing the negotiation. Selling to John at $800,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
