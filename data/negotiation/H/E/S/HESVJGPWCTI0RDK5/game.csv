"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product holds a lot of value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to make the purchase.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. While $12,000 is still lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about $14,000? This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers.",14000.0,Alice,5,
