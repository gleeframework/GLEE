"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1800000. This is a great opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This price still allows me to make a fair return while ensuring you get a valuable asset.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1500000, but I still think that's a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still not able to go that low. This product truly is exceptional, and $1300000 simply doesn't reflect its value. To bridge the gap, I'm offering a price of $1400000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $1350000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go below $1400000.  This product truly is exceptional, and that price reflects its value.  I'm willing to make one final adjustment and meet you halfway at $1375000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both our best interests to close this deal.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $1375000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer: $1300000 is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to explore other options. Please let me know if that's something you can live with.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
