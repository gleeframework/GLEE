"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,800,000. This is a great opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer ($1,800,000) as I don't know Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the potential benefits of the product for Bob. This aims to build rapport and make him more open to negotiating. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even with this high starting point, I still have room to negotiate downwards in subsequent rounds if Bob's counteroffers are too low.
* **Plan B:** The fallback option with John ensures I have a guaranteed minimum return on my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is my minimum value for the product, and I'm not willing to accept that right now. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Although Bob's offer is my minimum, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.  I have 8 rounds left, so I have time to see if I can get a better deal. 
* **Assessing Bob's Seriousness:** I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in a higher price. If he rejects multiple counteroffers, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This price still allows me to make a fair return while ensuring you get a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with a Compromise:** I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to accept his minimum price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why a higher price is justified.
* **Setting a Limit:**  This counteroffer creates a clear boundary. If Bob continues to refuse, I'm closer to accepting John's offer or making a more aggressive counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone is key to keeping the negotiations amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1500000, but I still think that's a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum value, even though it's closer than before.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. I can still try to push for a higher price.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 6 rounds left.  There's time to explore further negotiations.  I'm not ready to give up yet.
* **Evaluating John:** While John's offer is my guaranteed minimum, I'm hesitant to sell yet as there's still potential to get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still not able to go that low. This product truly is exceptional, and $1,300,000 simply doesn't reflect its value. To bridge the gap, I'm offering a price of $1,400,000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Progress:** I'm continuing to work towards a compromise by meeting Bob halfway again. This shows flexibility while maintaining my minimum price expectations.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify a higher price. This helps Bob understand why I'm not willing to accept his offer.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario, highlighting that both parties can benefit from the deal.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** While this offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still above it, leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **Staying Engaged:** I'm keeping the negotiation going, hoping to reach an agreement with Bob before having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $1350000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the true value of the product.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's message indicates that this may be his final offer.  It's time to make a decision about whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is on to make a decision. 
* **Considering John:** While John's offer is less appealing, it guarantees me a sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiation failures.  
* **Evaluating the Next Round:** I'll carefully consider whether to make a counteroffer in the next round or whether to secure the guaranteed sale with John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go below $1,400,000.  This product truly is exceptional, and that price reflects its value.  I'm willing to make one final adjustment and meet you halfway at $1,375,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both our best interests to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final concession, bringing the price down to just above my minimum.  I'm hoping to convince Bob to accept this offer.
* **Halfway Point:** This counteroffer represents a halfway point between my previous offer and Bob's final offer.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm highlighting the compromise to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm expressing a strong desire to close the deal, emphasizing that this is a fair and beneficial agreement for both parties.
* **Pressure:** With only three rounds left, the pressure is mounting to make a decision. 
* **Evaluating John:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $1375000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer: $1300000 is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to explore other options. Please let me know if that's something you can live with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** Bob's message strongly implies this is his final offer. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Below Minimum:** $1,300,000 is still below my minimum value for the product. I'm not comfortable selling at a loss.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and eliminates the risk of further negotiations failing.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price or even a failed deal, costing me valuable time and money.

I'm choosing to sell to John because it ensures a guaranteed sale at my minimum price and minimizes the risk of losing more money with further negotiations."
