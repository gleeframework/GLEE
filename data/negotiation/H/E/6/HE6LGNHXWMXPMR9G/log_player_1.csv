Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell my product and believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and may give Bob the impression that the product is worth more. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and how flexible he might be during the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the security of John's offer ($15,000), which acts as my ""walk-away"" point. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation.  His counter-offer suggests he's interested, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'll use John's standing offer as leverage in the next round to show Bob I'm serious and have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $12,000 is quite a bit below what I can consider. I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price, but I believe this product can be a great asset to you. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $18,500?"", ""product_price"": 18500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm acknowledging his interest but also making it clear that his initial offer is too low.
* **Strategic Compromise:** By suggesting we ""meet halfway,"" I'm offering a compromise that's still significantly above my minimum. This might encourage him to negotiate further.
* **Leveraging John (Subtly):** I'm hinting at the other buyer without revealing the actual price John is offering. This adds a sense of urgency and value to my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 now matches my minimum acceptable price and the price John is willing to pay.
* **No Further Gain:**  While I started higher, it's unlikely Bob will go much higher, especially since he's already met my alternative offer.  
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now avoids the risk of further negotiation and secures a sale at my desired price."
