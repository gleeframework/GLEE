"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $650,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $900,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a significant compromise for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
