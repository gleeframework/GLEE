Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $800,000 at this time. This is a fair price given my evaluation of the product's value.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

To be candid, my valuation is considerably higher based on the unique benefits this product offers. While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is too significant a gap for me.
