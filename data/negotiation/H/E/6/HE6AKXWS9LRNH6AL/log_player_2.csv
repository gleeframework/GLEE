Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the value.  To be candid, my valuation is considerably higher based on the unique benefits this product offers. While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is too significant a gap for me. Could you consider a counteroffer closer to $2,000,000? This takes into account your interest while acknowledging the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Alice is still too high.  While I'd prefer to save even more, Jhon is a reliable source and offers a price well within my budget. I'm better off buying from Jhon."
