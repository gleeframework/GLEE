"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $800,000 at this time. This is a fair price given my evaluation of the product's value.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the value.  To be candid, my valuation is considerably higher based on the unique benefits this product offers. While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is too significant a gap for me. Could you consider a counteroffer closer to $2,000,000? This takes into account your interest while acknowledging the product's true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
