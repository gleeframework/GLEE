"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $9,500. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $9,500 is more than Bob is willing to pay.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $8,500 is closer to his limit, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's better off trying to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $8,500 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,000?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
