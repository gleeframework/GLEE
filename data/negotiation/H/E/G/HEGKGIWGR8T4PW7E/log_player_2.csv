{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is a better price than $15,000 from John, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left, and he can potentially get the product for a price closer to his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the price closer to Alice's value of $12,000.  He's offering a price that's still slightly higher than Alice's value, but lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to incentivize her to accept."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Alice's offer is higher than his ideal price, so he's offering a price that's lower than Alice's last offer but higher than his initial counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving and demonstrates his willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price. He still has 5 rounds left to try and negotiate a better deal. While John's offer is a fallback option, Bob should keep trying to save money by continuing the negotiation with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing he's willing to move closer to Alice's position.  He's still below her last offer, but with only 4 rounds left, he needs to demonstrate progress. This offer could be attractive to Alice as she's also likely wanting to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now the same as John's price. Bob has only 3 rounds left and there's little chance he'll get a better deal from Alice at this point. To avoid the risk of not getting the product at all, Bob should take John's offer and purchase the product for $15,000."
