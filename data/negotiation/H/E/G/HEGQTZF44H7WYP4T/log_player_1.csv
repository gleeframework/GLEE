Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I value highly. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that you value the product highly, you're subtly justifying the higher price without directly stating it's worth that much to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. You're aiming for a win-win situation, where Bob feels he's getting a fair deal while you maximize your profit. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how price-sensitive Bob is. If he's very price-sensitive, you might need to adjust your strategy in subsequent offers.
* **One Chance:** You only have one chance with Bob before you go to John. This makes your initial offer even more critical."
