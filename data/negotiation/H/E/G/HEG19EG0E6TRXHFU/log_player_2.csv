Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still above your ideal price, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer and is within your budget.  It's likely that further negotiation would only result in minor price adjustments. Therefore, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product at a reasonable price."
