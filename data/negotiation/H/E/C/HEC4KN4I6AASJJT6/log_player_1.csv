Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Starting High:** I began with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit. 
* **Leaving Negotiating Room:** Offering $115 allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while ensuring I don't immediately drop to a price too close to my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** I'm aware that I have a fallback option with John, who will buy the product for $100. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $110 for the product, can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to Bob's perceived value of $120.  I'm willing to counter-offer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $113?"",
""product_price"": 113
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've made a smaller concession ($2) this time, signaling that I'm getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and encouraging him to do the same.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** $113 still provides a good profit margin above my minimum of $100 while leaving a slight possibility for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, can you consider $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer of $112. Here's why:

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  While I could potentially squeeze out another dollar or two, the difference is now minimal. Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or feeling frustrated.
* **Good Profit:** $112 still provides a healthy $12 profit over my minimum acceptable price. It's a win-win situation where both parties benefit.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation further might not yield significantly better results and could delay the sale. Accepting now secures the deal."
