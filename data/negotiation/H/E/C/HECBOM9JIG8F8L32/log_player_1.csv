{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product!  I'm asking for $130, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. It also signals that I'm open to negotiation, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $110 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate, but I will not sell the product for less than my minimum value. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $110 doesn't cover my costs.  How about $115? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $112 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable going lower than $120.  John is offering my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing a sale for a small price difference."
