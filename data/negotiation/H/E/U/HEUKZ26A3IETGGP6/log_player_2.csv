"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for a price that reflects its value to both of us? Would you consider $85 for now? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is still higher than my maximum budget of $100. I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $85 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. This reflects the value I place on the product, and I hope we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $80 for the product. This still allows room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is closer to my budget, it's still over my desired price point. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  I still have rounds to go and can always buy from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I'm happy to see the price dropping, $80 is still a bit too high for me. Let's aim for a price that truly benefits both of us. I'm willing to offer $78 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 78}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your final offer of $78. In order to move forward, I would like to propose a price of $79 for the product. This acknowledges the value you see in it while also allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $79 is just below my budget of $100, and it's a small enough difference that it's worth it to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up buying from John for $100.  I'll accept the offer and secure the product."
