Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully leaves some margin for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial goal.  This counteroffer is a compromise and hopefully will encourage Bob to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $17,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, it's still a decent profit and more than what I'd get from John.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
