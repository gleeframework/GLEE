Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $25 markup from your minimum ($150) is a reasonable starting point. It allows for potential profit while staying within a range that Bob might still consider if he values the product.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct and informs Bob about the product and the price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he rejects your initial price."
