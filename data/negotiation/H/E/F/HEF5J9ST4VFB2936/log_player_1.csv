Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but I'm also aware that I can always walk away and get $1,500,000 from John. This gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still below what I want.  I'm going to try and squeeze a bit more out of him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on his last offer. This is a good compromise that still allows me to get a decent profit while hopefully enticing him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of him rejecting again is too high, and John's offer is guaranteed. I'd rather sell to John and be done with it."
