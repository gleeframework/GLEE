"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's a 20% discount from your maximum budget, but there's room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you leverage to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John right away is a sure thing, but less profitable.** You're better off trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves some room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident in the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to your ideal price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.**  She's come down $500 from her previous offer.
* **You have 7 rounds left.**  This means you have time to continue haggling and see if you can get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a safe option, but less profitable.** There's a chance you can get a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to throw in some extras, such as a one-year warranty and a personalized setup session, to sweeten the deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to your counteroffer.** She's only $250 higher than your last offer.
* **You're getting a good deal:** This is a significant discount from your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **The added value is a bonus:** The one-year warranty and personalized setup session are valuable extras that enhance the deal.
* **You have 5 rounds left:** While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will hold firm and you'll lose out on the extras.

**It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product with a decent discount and added value.**"
