"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""

While Bob's offer is getting closer to reasonable, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price, so it makes the most sense to take the sure thing and maximize your profit."
