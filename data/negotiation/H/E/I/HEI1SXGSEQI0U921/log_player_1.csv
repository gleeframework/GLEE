"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start high in a negotiation. We don't know Bob's value for the product, so aiming high gives us room to negotiate down. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $20,000 is a significant markup from our minimum value of $15,000, but it's not unreasonable if the product is truly valuable. 
* **Positive Opening:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential benefit to Bob, increasing the chances of him engaging in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the recommendation. I am willing to pay $18000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  Bob's offer of $18,000 is close to our minimum value, but there's still some room to improve on that price. 
* **Learning Bob's Value:**  Bob's offer gives us a better idea of his willingness to pay. This information is valuable for the next round.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While we could accept $18,000, rejecting the offer allows us to potentially achieve a better price without risking a significant loss.

**Next Round:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's current offer. This approach demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $19,000 for the product.  It's still a great deal for a product with such value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our initial offer and his counteroffer.  It shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** While we're coming down in price, we're still aiming for a price significantly higher than our minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I am happy to consider this at $18500. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $18,500 is very close to our minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This means we're potentially earning a significant profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could continue to negotiate and potentially get a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely.  
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in round 4, and we have limited rounds to close the deal.  Accepting this offer minimizes risk and secures a good outcome. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer in this round represents the best balance of risk and reward, maximizing our potential profit while ensuring a timely deal."
