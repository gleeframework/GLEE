"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $17,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $14,500?  I'm sure we can work something out.",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $14,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",15750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,750 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $15,250. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go any higher.",15250.0,Bob,4,
