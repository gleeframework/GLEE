"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's a bit more in my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $9,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $9,800.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,200? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. However, $10,200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Can we meet in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your eagerness to close the deal, but $9,500 is simply too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower my price to $10,000. This is my final offer. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
