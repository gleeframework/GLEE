"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my value for it and your own. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the product's value and my potential other buyers, I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  Let's try to find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
