"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,200 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $7,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",7000.0,Bob,4,
