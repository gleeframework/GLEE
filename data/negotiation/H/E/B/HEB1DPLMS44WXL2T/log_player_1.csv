"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love!  I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's more than my minimum, but still less than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:**  Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Reasoning:** Mentioning that the product is ""amazing"" and that I think he'd ""love"" it helps justify the price point and appeal to Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident that I can get a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal. How about $110?  That's a good compromise, and it still gives you a great value on this product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price, but I'm still holding out for something more than his initial counteroffer.
* **Value proposition:** I reiterate the product's value to him, emphasizing the ""great deal"" he's getting even at $110.
* **Positive tone:**  Staying positive and friendly can keep the negotiation going and avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $105.  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm getting a much better deal than selling to John.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Bob walking away, and the price might not increase much further. Accepting his offer secures a good profit for me."
