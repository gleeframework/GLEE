Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be a great asset to your business.  My initial price is $1,200,000.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price, and I'm open to discussing your thoughts and suggestions."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've started with a price higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) but lower than Bob's maximum ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've emphasized the product's value and my willingness to negotiate, aiming to create a positive and collaborative tone.

This approach allows for:

* **Maximizing Profit:** By starting high, I have the potential to earn closer to my desired price. 
* **Flexibility:**  I've left space for negotiation, indicating my willingness to adjust the price, which could lead to a faster deal.
* **Keeping John as a Backup:** By acknowledging John's offer, I'm ensuring that I have a guaranteed fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm aiming for a higher price and believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob.  Therefore, I'll reject his offer and counter with my own proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  I think this price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my last offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise and makes the counteroffer seem reasonable.
* **Re-emphasizing Value:** I reiterate that the product's value justifies the price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, hoping to continue the negotiation effectively.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Secure a Price Closer to My Minimum:** $1,075,000 is still above my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Increase the Odds of Agreement:** Meeting halfway often signals a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Avoid the Fallback Option:** By offering a counteroffer, I'm actively trying to reach a deal with Bob before resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $950,000 was a reasonable starting point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This price is higher than my initial proposal but still within my budget constraints. I hope this suggestion will help us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I would prefer a higher price, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. 

Here's why:

* **Meeting my Minimum:** This offer ensures I get at least my minimum desired price, making it a financially favorable outcome.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob backing out or lowering his offer again. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting this offer could lead to future business opportunities with Bob if he's satisfied with the purchase. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision in this situation."
