"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm looking to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can we meet in the middle at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet you at $9500. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to me is at least $8000. What do you think?"
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $12000, which would be $10750. This is my final offer on this price. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",10750.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I'm still a bit above my budget with $10750. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $10750. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9375?",9375.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $9375, Bob. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $10500. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options, including selling it to someone else."
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one last offer to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,,
