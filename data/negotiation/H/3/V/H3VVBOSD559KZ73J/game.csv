"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,250, which is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a good value for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11250.0,Alice,3,
