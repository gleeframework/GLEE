{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product's value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's lower than my minimum value but higher than what Bob would be willing to pay initially. This strategy aims to:

* **Start the negotiation:** Get the ball rolling and see if Bob is interested at all.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This price allows for some wiggle room if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Show willingness to deal:** Demonstrating flexibility can make Bob more likely to engage.

I'll monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially make a new one.  However, if negotiations stall, I'll happily sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think I can go a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better deal. 

I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if negotiations don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still being a great deal for you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Slightly lower:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Still above my minimum:** I'm not willing to go below my minimum price point yet.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage acceptance.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain control:**  I'm not letting Bob dictate the terms.
* **Show good faith:**  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the product.
* **Increase the chances of a deal:** This price is more appealing to Bob, but still profitable for me. 

I'll carefully consider Bob's next move and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he continues to hold out, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1125000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum.  

Here's why:

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a delay in selling the product.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob might walk away entirely, leaving me with only John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Meeting halfway:**  Bob's counteroffer is a compromise and shows good faith.

This decision balances the potential gains with the risk of losing the deal. Selling for $1,125,000 is a solid outcome, and I'm happy with the agreement."
