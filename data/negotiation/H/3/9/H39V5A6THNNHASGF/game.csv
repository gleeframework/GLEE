"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and land at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your creative approach to finding a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offer, but I think a price of $1,050,000 is a more reasonable compromise. I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product and I'm willing to work with you to make a deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to make a serious offer. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is just $15,000 above your last offer.
