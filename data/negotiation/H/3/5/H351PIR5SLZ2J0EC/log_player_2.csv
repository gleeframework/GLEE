Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm seeing a lot of good faith here, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to stick to my last offer of $13,250.  This is my absolute top limit."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already given you a good deal. I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit. Even though Alice is getting closer, her offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's target of $12,000. With only one round left, it's highly unlikely Alice will go any lower. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
