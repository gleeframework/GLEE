Hi Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference at $155?  That's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I can offer you a slight adjustment to $157.50. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $157.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $152.50. This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us.",152.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $152.50 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I can offer you a slight adjustment to $154. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",154.0,Alice,7,
