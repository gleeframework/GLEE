Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $95.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts by acknowledging Bob's potential value for the product and provides a price that is lower than his perceived worth but still gives me a profit of $15. This should make it appealing to Bob while also leaving room for negotiation if he wants to try for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $85 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, I'm not satisfied with that profit margin. I will try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more than $85.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about $90, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $87.50? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $87.50 is still lower than my initial offer, it's close to my minimum acceptable price. Since Bob seems determined to pay no more, it's better to accept his offer and ensure a sale."
