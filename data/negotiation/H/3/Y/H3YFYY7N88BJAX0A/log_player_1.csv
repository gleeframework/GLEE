Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I'm asking for $11,500. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe it will be very valuable for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at that price, there's no need to go lower.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it slightly above that gives him a reason to consider it while still leaving room for Alice to profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** The $11,500 offer leaves some space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can decide if she wants to accept a slightly lower price or move on to John.
* **""Exclusive"" Offer:** Framing the offer as a pre-listing opportunity can make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal and encourage him to act quickly."
