Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing my potential profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:**  I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, making the offer more tempting.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Back-up Plan:**  If Bob rejects, I have the option of selling to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000. This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and far below my initial offer of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Although Bob's offer is low, he's demonstrating willingness to negotiate. I can likely get a better price by counter-offering.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:**  I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions.  I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridge the Gap:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reiterating the potential benefit of accepting my offer.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By rejecting his initial offer, I've shown that I'm not desperate for a sale. This strengthens my position in the negotiation.
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  My message leaves room for further discussion, suggesting that I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's valuable, but I have a budget in mind. How about meeting in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While Bob is getting closer, it's not yet a viable option.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. This suggests there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price with further negotiation.
* **Safeguard the Value:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a reliable fallback option.  I don't need to rush into accepting a price that's significantly below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I will try to understand Bob's budget constraints and see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while respecting your budget. Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm lowering my price to $850,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value again to justify the price, reminding Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Final Offer Vibe:**  The message suggests that this is a close-to-final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **John as Leverage:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I can afford to be firm while still being open to negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy. I may accept his last offer at $750,000 to avoid further negotiation, or I may opt to sell to John to ensure a higher profit. However, I believe $850,000 is a fair price that balances both our interests."
