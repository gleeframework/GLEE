"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth more than $850,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  While it's a great product, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $925,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think the product's value is worth more than that, but I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
