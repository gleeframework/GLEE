Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, it's best to start with an offer closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering it at $120 still gives you a significant profit margin over what John is willing to pay.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is designed to be inviting without revealing your desperation to sell. It allows you to assess Bob's interest level.  

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a great deal at $120.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You can potentially meet in the middle, still making more than selling to John.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and secure your minimum acceptable price."
