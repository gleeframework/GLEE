Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,450,000 is a strong starting point, giving you room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Positive Language:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""fair price"" to frame the offer positively.
* **No Mention of John:** Never reveal your backup offer with John. It weakens your negotiating position.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate before accepting or walking away to sell to John."
