"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $2,000,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction and a fair offer considering the product's potential.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I can do $1,100,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,425,000? This reflects the significant value this product offers while recognizing your budget.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but that price is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. I'm hoping we can close this gap soon.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, and I respect that.  To be frank, I have another potential buyer who sees the full value of this product at $1,500,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance.  My final offer is $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I need a decision on this round.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
