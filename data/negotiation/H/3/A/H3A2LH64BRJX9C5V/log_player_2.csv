Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, and I respect that.  To be frank, I have another potential buyer who sees the full value of this product at $1,500,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance.  My final offer is $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I need a decision on this round.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is playing hardball and her latest offer still exceeds your maximum budget. While she claims to have another buyer, there's no guarantee it's true, and even if it is, waiting to see if she's bluffing could result in losing the deal entirely. You have a reliable option with John at $1,200,000, which is within your budget and saves you money compared to Alice's final offer."
