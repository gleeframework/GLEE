"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. $11,500 is closer, but I'm really aiming for something under $10,000. How about $10,250? That's a significant step towards your price, and it would allow me to make this purchase.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not comfortable going below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so let's meet at $11,750. It's a small step up from your last offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,7,
