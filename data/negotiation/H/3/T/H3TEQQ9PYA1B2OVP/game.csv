"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $18000. I think it's a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to negotiations.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $16000?",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $16000. I'll offer you the product for $17000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $16000 and $14500.
