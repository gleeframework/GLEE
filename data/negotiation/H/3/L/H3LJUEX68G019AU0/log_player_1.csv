I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it allows for potential negotiation and still leaves room for a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to accept this offer. If not, I can always sell it to John for $15,000."
