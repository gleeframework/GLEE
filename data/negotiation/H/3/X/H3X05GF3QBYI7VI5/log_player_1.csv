""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the likelihood of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"" phrasing adds a layer of urgency that might encourage Bob to act quickly.

By offering the product at $925,000, you leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while you secure a $125,000 profit above your minimum."
