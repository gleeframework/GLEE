"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget for this purchase.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. That's the best I can do.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm feeling more comfortable with $11,250. It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,250. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900. That's the best I can do.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but $10,900 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. How about $11,100?  It's a small step from where we are now, and it's the best I can do.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to go with my other offer.",11100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm afraid $11,100 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900, just like I said before. I'm not willing to go any higher.",10900.0,Bob,8,
