"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good chunk of the potential value Bob sees in the product.  This gives us room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent price, I'm still holding out for more, especially since Bob clearly sees the value in the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying well above Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like more, Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away or I might have to accept a lower offer in a later round. It's time to secure a deal."
