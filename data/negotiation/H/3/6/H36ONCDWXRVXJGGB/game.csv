"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I've put a lot of work into it, and I know it's worth a significant amount.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand this product holds significant value for you, but that price is quite steep for me.  I'd be willing to start the conversation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and getting us closer to a deal.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could we consider $950,000? This shows I'm serious about buying, but also acknowledges the value this product brings.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a number that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the true value of what you're getting and shows my commitment to getting this deal done.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,150,000 is getting closer, but it's still a significant investment for me. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  I feel this is a fair offer and would allow us to close this deal today.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate how we're finding middle ground here.  You're right,  $1,050,000 is close, and I want to see this deal happen. To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit, and that's $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair for the value you're getting.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
