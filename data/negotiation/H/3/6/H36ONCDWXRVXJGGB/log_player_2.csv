"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I've put a lot of work into it, and I know it's worth a significant amount.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand this product holds significant value for you, but that price is quite steep for me.  I'd be willing to start the conversation at $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and getting us closer to a deal.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could we consider $950,000? This shows I'm serious about buying, but also acknowledges the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a number that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the true value of what you're getting and shows my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,150,000 is getting closer, but it's still a significant investment for me. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  I feel this is a fair offer and would allow us to close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate how we're finding middle ground here.  You're right,  $1,050,000 is close, and I want to see this deal happen. To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit, and that's $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a line in the sand at $1,100,000. While this is below her product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget and what John is offering.  There's no guarantee further negotiation with Alice will get her below $1,100,000. Cutting your losses and going with John secures the product at the best possible price."
