"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
 
You can try to get a better deal from Alice.  $130 is still more than you want to pay.  Let's see if you can get her down closer to your $150 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of this product for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $120, which is within your budget and a good deal compared to John's price. It's worth accepting this offer."
