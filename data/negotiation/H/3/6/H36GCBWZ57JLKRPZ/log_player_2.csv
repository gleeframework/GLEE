Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I've considered your latest offer carefully. To move forward, I propose a price of $89 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but she's still asking more than $80.  It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal with John.  You've successfully negotiated a lower price, and you're still getting a good deal, but it's not worth risking another few rounds when you have a sure thing available."
