"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $100. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $85, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate as well. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering our previous discussion, I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $88. This offer is fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I've considered your latest offer carefully. To move forward, I propose a price of $89 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous proposal, but it also reflects the value I place on the transaction. I hope this aligns with your budget and expectations.",89.0,Alice,5,
