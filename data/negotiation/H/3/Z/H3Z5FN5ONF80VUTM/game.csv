"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Would you consider $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand where you're coming from, but I can't quite go down to $8,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal quickly.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you holding firm on your valuation.  Let's try this - $9,500.  This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while still reflecting a fair deal for me.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would allow us to both walk away satisfied with the deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
