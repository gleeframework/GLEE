"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession, but I'm not willing to go much lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you have a better alternative. You can buy the product from John for $1,000,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding with your backup option (John)."
