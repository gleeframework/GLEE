"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,500. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,500 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, and $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I appreciate you working with me. I could go up to $13,300.  Do you think we can make a deal work at that price?",13300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13,300, Bob. However, I still think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $14,200. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",14200.0,Alice,7,
