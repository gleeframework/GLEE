"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to ensure it's within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold for this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This reflects the value I've placed on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my investment goals.",825000.0,Bob,4,
