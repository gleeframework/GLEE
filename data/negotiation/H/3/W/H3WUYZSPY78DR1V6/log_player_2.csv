$20,000 is far above my budget. I'll try to negotiate with Alice."

Round 2

I'm willing to pay the maximum I can for this product, which is $8,000. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

$17,000 is still too high. I'll try another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's really pushing my limit.  Let's see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$14,500 is still too high. I'm willing to go a little higher but it's getting close to John's price, so I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's last offer. If this doesn't work, I'll just buy from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still asking for a price that is too high.  While $13,500 is better than her previous offers, I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiations and potentially get stuck with a price higher than John's.  I'll buy from John."
