"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To find common ground, I would like to propose an offer of $10,500 for the product. This price still reflects the value and quality of the product, while being more in line with your budget. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $10,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal. Let's work together to find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
