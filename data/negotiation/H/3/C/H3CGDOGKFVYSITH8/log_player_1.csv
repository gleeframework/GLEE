Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price allows for some negotiation while still staying comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Professionalism:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob.

This strategy aims to achieve the best possible outcome while acknowledging Bob's potential counteroffers and the option to sell to John if negotiations are unsuccessful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm confident I can secure a better price by engaging in further counteroffers. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've made a substantial concession by lowering my price by $100,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The new price of $1,300,000 is still well above my minimum and keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Justification:** I've reiterated the product's value to justify my position and prevent Bob from anchoring negotiations too low.

This counteroffer balances my desire for a profitable outcome with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe $1,300,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to my minimum price, but $1,175,000 is still below my acceptable threshold.  It's clear he's interested, but I need to hold firm to secure a better deal. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but if Bob doesn't meet me closer to my price, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a price that works for you.  I'm willing to make one final offer to show my commitment to this deal. I propose $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my last concession, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Strong Justification:** I'm emphasizing the significant price reduction to highlight the value Bob is getting.
* **Walk-Away Point:** This price is my absolute minimum. If Bob rejects this, I will accept John's offer of $1,200,000 to avoid further negotiation and potential loss.

This counteroffer balances firmness with a final attempt to secure a deal that's acceptable to both parties."
