It's a great deal at $500,000, but it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get it even lower."

I'm starting with a pretty low counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to come down from her initial price. I'm aiming for a significant discount but still willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000

Alice has come down a bit, and $400,000 is a good price considering my maximum budget. It's not the absolute best I could get, but it's worth it to avoid the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially raising her price even further. I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
