Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product,  $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know if you're interested in that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer, as $8,500 is still too low for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $9000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8750. It's a good compromise, and we can both close this deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not ready to sell for that price yet.  I'll try to get a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,875?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $8875 is still a bit out of my price range. I can go up to $8250, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to close this deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. While I'd prefer to get a better price from Bob, his offers keep getting lower, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a guaranteed sale at a good price than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
