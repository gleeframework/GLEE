"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a bit more than $100, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm pretty sure this is the best we can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $110. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
