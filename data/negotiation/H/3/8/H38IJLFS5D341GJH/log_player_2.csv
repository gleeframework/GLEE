"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's actual worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget.  It's better to reject her offer and buy from John for $800,000."
