Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My floor:** I'm willing to sell to John for $1,000,000, so anything above that is a win for me.
* **Bob's ceiling:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Finding the sweet spot:**  Offering $900,000 gives me a decent profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation."
