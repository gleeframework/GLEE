"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my investment. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is fantastic, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $750,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",850000.0,Alice,5,
