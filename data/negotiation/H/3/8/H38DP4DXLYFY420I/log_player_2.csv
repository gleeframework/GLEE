"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my investment. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.
