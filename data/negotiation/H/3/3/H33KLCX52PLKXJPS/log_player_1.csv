"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer positively, emphasizing the value to Bob, and encouraging him to engage.
* **Strategy:** I'm setting a high initial price to maximize my potential earnings. I'm also leaving room for counteroffers and negotiation, which can potentially lead to a win-win situation.
* **Plan B:** While I'm negotiating with Bob, I have a fallback option of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $16,000, which is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to Bob while highlighting my willingness to compromise. I'm framing the offer as a fair deal that benefits both of us.
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to close the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer while keeping my options open for further negotiation if necessary."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're coming up in your offer, but $13,500 is still too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to go down to $15,000 as a final offer. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

* **Strategy:** I'm trying to push for a final agreement with my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have a clear decision to make: accept John's offer of $15,000 or continue negotiating with Bob with a higher risk of reaching no agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've gone up quite a bit already, and I'm still not comfortable with $15,000. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price for the product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, his offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a significant risk. There's no guarantee that he will increase his offer further, and I could potentially end up with a lower price than what John is offering.
* **Time constraint:** We are already in round 6, and there's only limited time left to reach a deal.

**Conclusion:**  Given the circumstances, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer of $15,000. This ensures that I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
