"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it will be profitable for you as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also establishes a strong starting point.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to both of us, making the price seem more justifiable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also prepared to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**
* **I have 10 rounds to close the deal, so I have time to negotiate further.**
* **Selling to John would secure my minimum price, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price through negotiation.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand your perspective. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer, but I'm not moving too far from my original price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but also that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message again emphasizes the value for both of us, making it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Lowering the Price:** I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and willingness to compromise, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm comfortable with. I would like to propose $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time is a Factor:**  We are already in round 4, and I want to avoid further negotiation.
* **Potential for Better Offers:** While I'd ideally like to get closer to my desired price, there's a chance that Bob might reject my counteroffers in subsequent rounds, and I might end up with a lower price or even have to sell to John.

**Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice at this stage, as it guarantees a profit close to my minimum acceptable price and minimizes the risk of further negotiation.**"
