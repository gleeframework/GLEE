"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While the product looks great, $110 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $110 might be a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price that's closer to what I had in mind.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal that's still above your original offer and closer to my original price.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I appreciate the concessions you've made so far.  How about we split the difference and settle at $80? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",80.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $87.50. It's a fair deal that's still above your original offer and closer to my original price.",87.5,Alice,7,
