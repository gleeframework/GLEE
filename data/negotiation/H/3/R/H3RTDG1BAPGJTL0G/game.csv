"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in purchasing it for $110. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $110 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $130. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase today.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",125.0,Alice,5,
