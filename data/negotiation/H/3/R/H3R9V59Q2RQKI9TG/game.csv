"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,500? ",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really serious about this product, though, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000.  Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not sure I can meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you a price of $11,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What are your thoughts?",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,200. It's getting closer, but I'd really like to close this deal at $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,500. I think this is the minimum I can accept to make the deal worthwhile for me. What are your thoughts?",11500.0,Alice,7,
