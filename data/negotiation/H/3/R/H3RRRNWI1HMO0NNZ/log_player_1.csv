"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always beneficial to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" the message subtly justifies the high initial price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrase ""starting point for our discussion"" signals your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving the door open for a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price within the range of $1,200,000 to $1,400,000. I would like to propose an initial price of $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is within a reasonable range, accepting it now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. You know John is waiting in the wings with a guaranteed $1,500,000. 

It's still early in the negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal while keeping the door open for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However,  $1,350,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This price reflects the immense value this product brings while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:**  Coming down from the initial price demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. However, the counteroffer remains significantly above Bob's stated range, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Reiterate Value:**  The message again emphasizes the ""true potential"" to justify the high price point. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to steer the negotiation closer to your acceptable range while still leaving room for further discussion. It tests Bob's willingness to move substantially from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,550,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now exceeding what John is offering. Accepting this offer secures the highest possible profit for you at this stage. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better outcome, and it risks losing Bob entirely."
