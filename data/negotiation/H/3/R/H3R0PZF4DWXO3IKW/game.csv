"I'm really interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. Can we discuss further?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, I still need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This would still leave us both with a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal for yourself, and I respect that.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,250,000.  This would be a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
