Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly less than the value of the product to Bob, giving him a good incentive to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my desired price point, and it's likely that further negotiation will result in a price closer to $9,500 anyway. Accepting his offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation and ensures a sale at a profitable price."
