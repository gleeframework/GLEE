Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so aiming high initially is key.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying significantly above your minimum.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message implies you understand the product's value to Bob without being overly aggressive.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging your guaranteed fallback option with John."
