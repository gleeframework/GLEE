"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $17,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is too low for me.  This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to go up to $11,500. I believe that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,750? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",12750.0,Alice,5,
