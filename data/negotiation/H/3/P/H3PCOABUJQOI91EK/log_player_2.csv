Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8500. I'm willing to meet you at $8400, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you only have a few rounds left. You've made a good attempt to negotiate a lower price but it seems unlikely Alice will budge further. To avoid risking losing out on the product altogether, it's best to take the guaranteed offer from John for $8,000."
