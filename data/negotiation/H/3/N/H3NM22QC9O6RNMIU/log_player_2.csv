Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go as low as $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're serious about purchasing the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at the door.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's price is still too high, even though she's shown a willingness to compromise.  You've reached a point where you're unlikely to get a lower price from Alice.  It's better to buy from John and save $225,000."
