Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher offer ($15,000) allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a price well above your minimum ($10,000).
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The high offer will quickly reveal how interested Bob is. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you know he's serious. 
* **Backup Plan (John):** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't need to sell the product immediately. There's always a chance Bob walks away, and you'll get your minimum from John."
