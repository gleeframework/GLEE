"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8750. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your asking price, but $8750 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8600?  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",8600.0,Bob,4,
