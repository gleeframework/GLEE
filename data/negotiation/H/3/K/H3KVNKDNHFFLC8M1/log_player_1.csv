{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've set the initial price at $9,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation, allowing me to adjust the price based on Bob's response. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is reasonable:**  $8,500 is a fair price, considering the product is worth $8,000 to both of us.
* **Goal is to maximize profit:**  However, I'm aiming for a higher price. 
* **Next round:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired $9,000.
* **John is still an option:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is always a fallback, but I'm hopeful I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,750. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Split the difference:** This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasize value:**  The message reinforces that the price is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Maintain leverage:**  This counteroffer is close to Bob's offer, keeping the negotiation moving towards a successful outcome. 
* **John is still available:**  I'm confident I can secure a better price than $8,000, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your asking price, but $8750 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8600?  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my goal:**  Bob's offer of $8,600 is very close to my desired $9,000. 
* **Minimizing risk:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or I'll end up selling to John for a lower price. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Each round of negotiation takes time and energy. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale.

Ultimately, $8,600 is a good outcome, given the initial offer of $9,000.  It's important to balance maximizing profit with the potential for a failed negotiation."
