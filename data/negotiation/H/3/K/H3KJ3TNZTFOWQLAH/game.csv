"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a respectable offer, I'm confident that this product's true value is reflected closer to my original asking price. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,3,
