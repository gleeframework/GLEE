"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $900,000 is still significantly above your ideal price. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  By rejecting, you open the door to counteroffers and potentially a better price.

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to formulate a counteroffer in the next round. Consider how much lower you're willing to go while still ensuring a profit for Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product.  This would still allow you to make a substantial profit, and I'm confident I can leverage this product to its full potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lowering the price:**  This counteroffer significantly reduces the price while still allowing Alice a profit margin of $150,000, which is likely still attractive to her. 
* **Reasoning:**  The message provides justification for the price, focusing on your willingness to make a profit for Alice while highlighting your potential to utilize the product. This encourages Alice to consider your offer seriously. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends with an open-ended question, leaving room for further discussion and potentially closing the deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, and I believe you'll be happy with the value you're getting. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $850,000 is still outside your target price range.  
* **Negotiation continues.** You still have room to bargain and potentially achieve a better price. 

**Next Steps:** You should make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your ideal range. Consider offering a price between $750,000 and $800,000, explaining that this will be the final offer before you consider buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my financial constraints. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:**  Clearly stating that this is your final offer creates a sense of urgency and pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Reasonable price:**  $800,000 is a fair compromise, still allowing Alice a $200,000 profit.
* **Alternative option:**  Mentioning John as an alternative reinforces your position and motivates Alice to accept your offer. 
* **Concise message:**  A direct and concise message keeps the focus on the price and avoids unnecessary back-and-forth."
