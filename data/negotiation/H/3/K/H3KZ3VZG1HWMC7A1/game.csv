"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product.  This would still allow you to make a substantial profit, and I'm confident I can leverage this product to its full potential. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, and I believe you'll be happy with the value you're getting. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my financial constraints. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
