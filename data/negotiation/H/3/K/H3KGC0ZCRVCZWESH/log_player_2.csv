"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is the same as John's price, so it's not beneficial to accept. Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John, which is essentially the same outcome in terms of price. You're still getting the product for the maximum you're willing to pay, so it's a neutral decision."
