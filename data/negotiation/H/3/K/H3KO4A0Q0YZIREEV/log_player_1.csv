Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I know you'll love it!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price Bob is willing to pay. Since the product is worth $120 to him, there's a chance he might accept a price higher than that, but lower than your guaranteed $150 from John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed to sell the product for your minimum acceptable price."
