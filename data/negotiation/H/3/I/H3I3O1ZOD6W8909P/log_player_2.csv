"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it will be highly valuable for you, even more so than the asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price.  This achieves two things:

1. **Gauges Alice's flexibility:** A low counteroffer helps understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
2. **Leaves room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it gives us space to gradually increase our bid while staying well below our $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I see the value at $14,000, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice reduced her price considerably, which is a good sign. However, the new offer is still $1,000 above our budget and John's offer. We should continue negotiating to try to reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit far from that number. Could you do $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're raising our counteroffer, showing Alice we're willing to move closer to her price. By suggesting $9,000, we're aiming for a price point that's attractive to us while still leaving room for some final negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $10,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as you can't get a better deal elsewhere."
