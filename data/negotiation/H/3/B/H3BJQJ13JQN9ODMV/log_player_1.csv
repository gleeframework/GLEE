{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $150 from John, aiming higher with Bob could yield more profit.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Offering the product between Bob's value ($120) and your minimum ($150) is key. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $135 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $15 from his perceived value) while giving you a $15 profit margin over selling to John. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
