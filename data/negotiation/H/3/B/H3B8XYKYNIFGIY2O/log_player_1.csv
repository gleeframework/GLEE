{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets a $400,000 discount from our bottom line, while we still earn a significant profit of $400,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" adds a touch of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer quickly."
