# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget.  It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $900,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, but I can see that's not feasible for you. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can still try to negotiate a lower price, and buying from John is a better option right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my limits.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1100000, which would be $1050000. I think that's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You've negotiated for several rounds and it seems like you might not be able to get a lower price from Alice.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed offer from John."
