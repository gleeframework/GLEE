Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer that I think is reasonable, given the value of the product to me. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

This is a premium price, but I'm willing to see if Bob is interested in purchasing the product at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still a significant amount. Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll consider his offer carefully.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better price. I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer, but still reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer. I'll offer:

{""product_price"": $850,000}

This is a reasonable compromise, as it's still higher than Bob's offer, but not as high as my initial price. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
