"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I do like the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10250.0,Alice,5,
