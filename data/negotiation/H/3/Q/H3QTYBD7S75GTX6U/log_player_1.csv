Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you offering this product, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in acquiring this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. How about we start with $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
