"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate you offering this product, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in acquiring this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. How about we start with $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still outside my comfort zone. Given the value of the product to me, I'm prepared to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant investment for me, but it's the highest I can go at this time. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you. I'm confident you'll find the product's value will far exceed this price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range.  To make this work, I need to stay under $950,000.  If you're serious about selling, I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is still a great deal for you. I'm confident you'll find the product's value will far exceed this price. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise and my absolute limit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $955,000, which is just $5,000 above your absolute limit. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",955000.0,Alice,9,
