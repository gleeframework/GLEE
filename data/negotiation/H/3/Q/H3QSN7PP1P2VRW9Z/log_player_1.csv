Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite high. This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,200,000 is not feasible. How about we start the conversation at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
