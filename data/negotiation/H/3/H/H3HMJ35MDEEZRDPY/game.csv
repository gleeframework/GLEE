"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500?  It's a fair price for a product worth $12,000 to you, and it gives us both a good deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
