"I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a discount.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price is within my range, and it allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and it reflects the maximum I can pay while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and my minimum price of $1,500,000. Let's try $1,300,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
