"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  $110 is too close to what I'm willing to pay from John.  Let's see if we can negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a bit tight for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we say $108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice is now offering $108, which is only $8 over my limit of $100. While I could try to haggle further, there's a risk of her rejecting my offer and forcing me to either pay more from John or risk losing the deal entirely.  It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept."
