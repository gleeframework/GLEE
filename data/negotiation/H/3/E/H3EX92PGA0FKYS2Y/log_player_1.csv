{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $120 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. It's worth at least $150 to me, so I'll try to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet at $140. I would like to propose $130 as my maximum offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'd prefer to sell it to Bob, I'm not willing to lose money on the deal.  John is offering a guaranteed $150, so selling to him is the best choice for me."
