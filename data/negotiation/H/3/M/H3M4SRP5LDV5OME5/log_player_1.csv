"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me some leeway and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell it for that price.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will entice him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is continuing to go lower with his offers.  While I could continue to counteroffer, it's starting to seem like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $10,000.  It's time to take the safe option."
