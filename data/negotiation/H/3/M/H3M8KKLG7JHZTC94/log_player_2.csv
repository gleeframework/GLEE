"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save money by negotiating with Alice.  The initial offer is too high, but there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Bob can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer starts at a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about negotiation and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  The offer is also well within Bob's budget, making it a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has several rounds left to try and get a better deal.  Buying from John at this point would be a worse outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a lower price.  The offer is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has several rounds left, and he can likely secure a better deal by continuing to counter.  Buying from John at this point would be a worse outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his offer slightly. This strategy shows a willingness to compromise without conceding too much. The offer is still lower than Alice's last offer, allowing for further negotiation in the remaining rounds.  At this point, Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible, and buying from John would be a less favorable outcome."
