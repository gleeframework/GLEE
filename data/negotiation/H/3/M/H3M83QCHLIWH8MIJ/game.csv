"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a high value. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1200000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've considered your counteroffer carefully, and while I appreciate your flexibility, I must adhere to my budget constraints.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1000000. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can seal the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
