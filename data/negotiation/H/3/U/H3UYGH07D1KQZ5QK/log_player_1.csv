"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the price, making the negotiation feel more collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum,  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is showing interest, and I can likely get closer to my target price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Accepting his offer now would limit my potential earnings. I can potentially get a higher price if I counter-offer. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to be more assertive in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counter-offer of $9,500 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still working towards my goal of a higher price.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Sense of urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $8,800 is getting close to my minimum of $12,000, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable accepting. I'm only halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I have more room to maneuver.
* **Potential to improve:** I believe there's still potential to get a higher price. Bob is clearly interested, and I can likely get closer to my target price with a counter-offer.
* **John is my safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating and try to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $9,200?  This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding middle ground:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise while not giving away too much.
* **Reiterating fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us. 
* **Urging a decision:** I'm reminding Bob that this could allow us to ""close the deal"" to encourage a swift decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $8,600 is still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to settle.
* **Potential for improvement:** I still have a few rounds left, and I believe there's potential to get a higher price with a counteroffer.  Bob is clearly interested and is negotiating.
* **John is my safety net:** The fact that I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating and hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,600 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work. How about $8,900? This price reflects the value of the product while being within your budget."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession by coming down to $8,900, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Reiterating value:** I'm again mentioning the product's value to justify the price.
* **Appealing to budget:** I'm framing the offer as being within Bob's budget, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8900, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to the last two rounds, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but not quite there.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If I continue to negotiate with Bob, there's a risk that we won't be able to agree on a price, and I'll be left with no sale.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John for $12,000 is a sure thing, and it's the best outcome given the current situation. 

I'm choosing to take the guaranteed deal with John to avoid the risk of further negotiation and a potential loss of income."
