"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $875,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay above $900,000.  Let's settle at $900,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
