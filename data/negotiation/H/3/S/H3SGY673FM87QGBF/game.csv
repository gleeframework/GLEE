"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product but I can't go above $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,500,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,500,000 is still above my budget, I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to secure the product within my financial limits.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
