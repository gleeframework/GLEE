"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $8,500? This would give us both a fair deal, and allow you to get this valuable product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500, which would be $7,975. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",7975.0,Bob,4,
