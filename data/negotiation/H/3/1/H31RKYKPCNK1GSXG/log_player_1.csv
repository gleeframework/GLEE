{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer sets a price point that is significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. This is a good starting point for a potential win-win situation."
