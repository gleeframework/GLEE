Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,750,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for the right buyer. I'm confident you'll see the potential in this offering. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob some incentive to consider the offer, knowing they could potentially get a good deal.
* **Message:** The message is friendly, emphasizes the product's value, and uses open-ended language (""Let me know your thoughts""). This allows Bob to express interest without committing to a purchase right away.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:**  By offering a higher price, I increase the chance of getting a higher profit. 
* **Negotiation:**  Offering a price above my minimum leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially reach a price that's mutually beneficial. 
* **Risk mitigation:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for my minimum price. This mitigates the risk of losing money on the deal."
