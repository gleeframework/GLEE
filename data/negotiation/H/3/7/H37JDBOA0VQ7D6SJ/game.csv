"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. While it's unfortunate that our initial offer didn't align, I understand your position. To better serve both our interests, I propose a compromise at $10,000 for the product. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while being more accessible to your budget.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $10,000 is getting closer, I'm still limited by my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.  How about $9,000? It's a fair offer that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my financial constraints.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. In light of your proposal, I would like to suggest a price of $9,500 for the product. This slightly increases our profit margin while remaining within your budget constraints. I believe this could be a win-win solution for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still slightly over my budget.  Let's aim for a final price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to reach an agreement.",9250.0,Bob,6,
