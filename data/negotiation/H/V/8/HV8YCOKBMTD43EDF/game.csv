"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm really interested in the product, so I hope we can make a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
