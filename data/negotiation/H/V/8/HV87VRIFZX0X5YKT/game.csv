"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm only willing to pay something closer to $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
