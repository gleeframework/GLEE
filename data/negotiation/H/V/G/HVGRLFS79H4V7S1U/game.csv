"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially for someone like you who can maximize its potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
