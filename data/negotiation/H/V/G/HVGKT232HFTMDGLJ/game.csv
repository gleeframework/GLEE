"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you making it a special price for me. However, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going down to $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $10,750?  I'm very interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair to both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $10,750. I'll make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's the best compromise we can reach. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $11,250 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to budge any further. I'll make one more counteroffer, and it's my final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
