Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you making it a special price for me. However, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going down to $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $10,000.  While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $10,750?  I'm very interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $10,750. I'll make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's the best compromise we can reach. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims this is her final offer, there's still a gap between her offer and your target price. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your goal of $10,000 in the next round.  You've already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $11,250 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to budge any further. I'll make one more counteroffer, and it's my final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $11,500, and it seems unlikely that she will budge further. At this point, you've negotiated as much as you can with Alice. It's time to take advantage of the guaranteed price from John, which aligns with your initial budget goal of $10,000.  While you're paying a little more than you initially hoped, it's still a better deal than the $11,500 Alice is offering."
