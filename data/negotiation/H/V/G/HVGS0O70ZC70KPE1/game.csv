"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  I think that's a fair price considering what the product is worth to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to pay closer to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
