"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than Alice's value of $8,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000, which is still above Alice's value of $8,000, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is still less than what Bob would pay John, it's closer to Alice's initial offer. It shows Alice is willing to compromise slightly, but not much. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $9,500. This is a compromise between his previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's latest offer of $10,500. It shows Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway while still trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  However, it's still not a deal that offers significant savings.  Considering the back-and-forth negotiation has already happened, it's likely Alice won't go any lower.  Therefore, Bob is better off buying from John for $12,000 and avoiding further negotiation. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer again."
