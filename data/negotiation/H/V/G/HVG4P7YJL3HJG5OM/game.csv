,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $150 for it, what do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $165 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $155. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $155, but I'm still a bit short on the profit I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but $160 is still above my budget. I'm happy to go up to $157.  Let's try to make this work.",157.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $158. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",158.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're at your final offer, but $158 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $156.  Let's see if we can make this final deal.",156.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate at this point. I'm not willing to go any lower than $158, but I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. How about I add a free accessory to the package if you're willing to meet me at $158?",158.0,Alice,9,
