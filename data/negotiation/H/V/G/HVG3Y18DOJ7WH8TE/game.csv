"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can get the price down a bit. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference at $850,000?  I'm confident this price still represents a good value for you, and it gives me a reasonable return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could you do $750,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
