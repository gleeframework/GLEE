"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, while also staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is quite a bit below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's try $900,000. This offer reflects a fair price considering my budget constraints, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
