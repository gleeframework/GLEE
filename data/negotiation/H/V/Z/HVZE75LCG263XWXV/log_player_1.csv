Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than my minimum value but still potentially attractive to Bob, considering the product is worth $15,000 to him.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm not giving away the product for less than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still higher than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will incentivize him to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum value, and it's clear that further negotiation won't get me a significantly higher price.  Selling to Bob ensures a faster transaction and avoids potential delays or complications with John."
