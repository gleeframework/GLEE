Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I open the offer to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize profit. She knows she has a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so any price Bob accepts above that is a win.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but Alice has a strong fallback position.
* **Value Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and understanding of Bob's personality (e.g., if he's known to walk away from high prices), she might adjust her approach."
