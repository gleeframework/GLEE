"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to compromise while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent profit, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.  This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not willing to drop to Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, I'm still hoping to close at a slightly higher price.  I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation just yet.  I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also showing Bob that I'm not willing to accept anything below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal. It's a decent profit for me, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of losing the deal to John or having the negotiation drag on further outweighs the potential of a slightly higher price."
