Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the purchase. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we want to maximize our profit.  Offering it slightly below our guaranteed sale price to John ($15,000) increases the chance Bob accepts while still securing a good profit.
* **Urgency and Value:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing our bottom line. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price of $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate further."
