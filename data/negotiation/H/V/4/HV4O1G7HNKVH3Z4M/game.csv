"I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this product, which is a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me.  This item would need to be significantly less expensive for me to be interested. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is also a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we try $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am interested in the product.  Would you consider $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already told you that I need to make a profit, and $8,000 is still below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time. I can offer you the product for $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
