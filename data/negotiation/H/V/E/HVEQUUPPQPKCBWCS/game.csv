"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking to sell it to you for $10000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to do $8500?  That's a good price for me and a fair deal for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9200. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for in the market. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9200 is still a little out of my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $8800. I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8800. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and what we've discussed so far.",9000.0,Alice,5,
