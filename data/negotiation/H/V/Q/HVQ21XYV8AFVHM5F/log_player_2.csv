Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low. It doesn't even cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives you a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $950,000. While getting the product for $950,000 is a decent deal, John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000. It's better to secure the known savings and buy from John at this point."
