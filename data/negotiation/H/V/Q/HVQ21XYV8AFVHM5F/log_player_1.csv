Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  It's a good product, but I need to make sure it makes sense for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low. It doesn't even cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives you a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $850,000?  That's a significant investment for me but shows I'm serious about making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000 for this product. It's a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you considering the value you'll gain. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
