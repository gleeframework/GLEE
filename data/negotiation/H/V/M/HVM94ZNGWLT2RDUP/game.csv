"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1050000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I've already gone above and beyond to meet you halfway, and I'm not willing to go any further. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1090000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can understand that I need to get a good price for the product. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,7,
