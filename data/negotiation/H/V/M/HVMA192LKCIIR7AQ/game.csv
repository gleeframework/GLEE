"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",87.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $87.50 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $86. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you at $87.00. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",87.0,Alice,5,
