"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? I'm really hoping we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'll offer you a slight compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to keep the deal moving forward.",14500.0,Alice,5,
