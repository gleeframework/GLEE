"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my side.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $950,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to sell for $1,025,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still not quite there for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, my absolute minimum.  This is a final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",1000000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price we can both agree on.  However, I'm sticking to my bottom line of $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. We're down to the wire here, so let's see if we can close this deal. ",1000000.0,Alice,9,
