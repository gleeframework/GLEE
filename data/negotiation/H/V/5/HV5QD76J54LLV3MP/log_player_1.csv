"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate by asking for his thoughts, setting the stage for further dialogue. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is a high starting point, and Bob might reject it.  
* I'm prepared to lower the price in subsequent rounds, but I'll be strategic in my adjustments to maximize my profit.
* I'm also aware of the backup option with John, which provides a safety net in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value.** I need to earn at least $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. 
* **There are more rounds available.** I'm not desperate to close the deal and can continue negotiating to potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback option.** While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I can do better if I can get closer to my desired price range.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to round 3 and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000.  I'll need to find a balance between staying firm on my value and being open to negotiation."

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. By making a significant compromise, I'm hoping to entice Bob into accepting this offer while still securing a profitable sale.  I'll continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

```

**Explanation:**

**Next Steps:**
