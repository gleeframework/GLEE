"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe could be extremely valuable to your business. I'm willing to let it go for a price that's significantly lower than what it's worth to me.  I'm confident you'll see the potential in this product. Let's talk numbers - I'm proposing a price of $1500000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
