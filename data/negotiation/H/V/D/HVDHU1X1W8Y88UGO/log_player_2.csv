"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. There's no immediate benefit to accepting. By rejecting, you open the door to potentially negotiating a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows you to continue haggling and potentially secure an even lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm still only able to go up to $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to discussing the deal further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $1,350,000, only $50,000 above your last counteroffer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal, especially since John is offering the product for $1,500,000. It's reasonable to accept and secure a significant discount."
