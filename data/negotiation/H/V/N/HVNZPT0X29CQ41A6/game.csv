This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
