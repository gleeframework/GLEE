"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's potential for further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer exists. To guarantee the purchase within his budget, Bob should opt to buy from John, securing the product for $1,000,000."
