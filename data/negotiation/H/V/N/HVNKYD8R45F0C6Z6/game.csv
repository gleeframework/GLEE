,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  How about $1100000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to ensure a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $950000 is still too far below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1025000? This price would allow both of us to achieve a fair deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1025000. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is my maximum budget. Can you consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it also reflects the value of this product. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
