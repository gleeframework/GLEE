"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Optimistic but reasonable:**  $175 is a reasonable starting point, given that the product is worth $80 to Bob and I have a backup buyer willing to pay $150. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm aiming for a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **I have a backup buyer:**  Since John is willing to pay $150, I can afford to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is reasonable:** $140 is a reasonable compromise,  significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price.
* **Focus on finding a middle ground:** I'm emphasizing the need for a compromise, suggesting flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Keep the conversation positive:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and avoid escalating the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not quite:** $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.
* **Strong backup option:** John is waiting to buy at $150, so I have a solid fallback. 
* **Potential for better deal:** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $135? It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm offering a slight concession, showing that I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I'm emphasizing that $135 is a ""fair compromise,"" suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Focusing on a positive outcome:**  I'm emphasizing that this price will make ""both of us happy,"" highlighting the potential benefits of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of losing more:** Bob's offer of $132 is close to my minimum, but there's a risk of further negotiations dragging on and ending in a lower price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer and more than covers my minimum. 
* **Time is valuable:**  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking a lower price when I have a sure thing."
