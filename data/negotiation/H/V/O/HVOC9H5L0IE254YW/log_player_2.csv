# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. While I acknowledge the value of this product, $1,125,000 remains beyond my budget.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $1,100,000. This price is closer to your offer, but I'm still looking for a better return on my investment. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where Alice's offer is very close to his maximum budget. However, there's still a $100,000 gap.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might not budge further, or she might raise the price again. Given that he has an alternative option with John, it's more prudent for Bob to secure the product at a guaranteed lower price.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, guaranteeing a successful outcome."
