"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a significant discount.  He's offering $9,500, which is still a decent profit for Alice (more than her value of $8,000) but also represents a substantial savings for Bob. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also that he's willing to walk away if the price doesn't come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further. There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob can always buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing that he's willing to compromise.  He's increasing his offer from $9,500 to $10,500, demonstrating that he's serious about buying but still wants a good deal. This offer is still below Alice's most recent offer of $13,000, and it's important to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what he's hoping for.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before resorting to buying from John. With 5 rounds remaining, there's still time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making another incremental increase in his offer.  By offering $11,500, he's demonstrating a continued willingness to compromise while still keeping the price below Alice's latest offer of $14,000. This keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement. With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is starting to increase, and Bob needs to be careful not to overplay his hand."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is only slightly decreasing her price, and it's still higher than Bob's target. There are only 3 rounds left, so the risk of losing out on the deal is increasing. However, Bob can still try to push for a lower price. If he can get Alice to budge further, he can potentially buy the product for less than John's price. It's a calculated risk, but Bob is willing to gamble in hopes of a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 2 rounds left, Bob needs to make a significant move. Offering $12,000 is a large jump from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It's also closer to Alice's last offer of $14,500, indicating a willingness to meet halfway. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to seriously consider buying from John in the final round, as the risk of losing the deal increases."
