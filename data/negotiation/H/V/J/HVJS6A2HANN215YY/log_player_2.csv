"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I have room to negotiate downwards and should aim to get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $7,000."", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) than Alice's asking price ($9,500) and my maximum budget ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  Alice is likely to counter my offer. By starting low, I'm signaling that I'm serious about buying but need her to meet me closer to my price range. 
* **John as a Backup:** I keep in mind that I can always buy the product from John for $8,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's find some common ground. How about $8,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gives me some room to work with.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $8,500 is still above my ideal price and my fallback option (John). I'll try to meet her halfway between her current offer and my previous one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting $7,750, I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below my maximum budget.
* **Midpoint:** This offer sits directly in the middle of her last offer ($8,500) and my previous counteroffer ($7,000).
* **Pressure:**  I'm still maintaining pressure by keeping my offer below $8,000, reminding her that I have alternative options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,750 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's try $8,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement here.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down to $8,250, which is only slightly above my alternative of buying from John for $8,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially get me a slightly lower price, but there's also the risk that Alice could walk away, and I'd end up paying $8,000 anyway.
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now saves me the time and effort of further negotiation. 

At this point, the potential savings of a few more dollars are not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
