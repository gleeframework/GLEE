"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me.  How about we settle around $850,000? This offer reflects a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true worth. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This price is still very attractive given the value this product offers.",925000.0,Alice,3,
