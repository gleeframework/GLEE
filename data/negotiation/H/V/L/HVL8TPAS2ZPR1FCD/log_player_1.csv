Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum price but also leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, it signals he's aiming for a lower price, and we can strategize further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is above my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise, lowering the price slightly but still leaving room for profit.  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting.  There's a chance he might be willing to go higher in the next round, but it's not worth the risk of losing him completely."
