I'm still not comfortable with $127.50. I'll try to negotiate further with Alice, but I'm also considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

I've been negotiating with Alice for a while now, and while she's been flexible, we're still too far apart. At this point, I'm better off buying from John for $80. It's within my budget and a more guaranteed deal."
