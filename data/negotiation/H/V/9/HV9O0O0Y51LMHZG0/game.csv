"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is my best offer at the moment, but I'm open to negotiations.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I think it's the lowest I can go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $11,500 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,250. This is my final offer. Let's seal the deal.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I'm confident that I can sell this product to someone else for this price.",12000.0,Alice,7,
