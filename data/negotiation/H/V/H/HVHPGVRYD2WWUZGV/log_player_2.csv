"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. This price reflects its unique features and the significant value it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price, and significantly higher than what the product is worth to me. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the initial offer and counter-offering is a good strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price acknowledges your concerns while also allowing me to fairly compensate for the value of this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and there's still room for both of us to find a price that works. I'll counter with a lower offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This price is a good compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  $925,000 reflects a good compromise for both of us.  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also allowing you to make a profitable investment. I'm confident this price will work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my target, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I have five rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with another offer and continue to work towards a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $910,000.  This price represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 910000}
