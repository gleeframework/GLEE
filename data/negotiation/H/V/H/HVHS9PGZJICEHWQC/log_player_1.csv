Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, we want to secure the highest possible price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Above Reserve Price:**  The offer is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), ensuring a substantial profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your earnings and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
