Round 5

Round 7

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $9,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very firm on her price and is unlikely to go below $9,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it's no longer worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice. You can save $1,000 by going with John."
