"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still leaves me a healthy profit.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your estimated value, it's still a significant amount.  You can likely negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. That would still allow you a sizable profit and is a much better price for me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair deal considering your estimated value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to your desired price and still allows you to save $100,000 compared to buying from John. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will refuse further reductions, and you'll end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer is a good balance of saving money and securing the product."
