"Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can likely get a better price than $7,500.  Since Alice values the product at $8,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that Alice might consider.  This demonstrates that Bob is serious about negotiating, but also that he is willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,200, which is only $200 more than Bob's counteroffer.  At this point, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting the offer saves Bob time and effort, and still gets him a good price."
