Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,100,000. I know its value to you is significant, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000,  getting that price from Bob isn't realistic. Bob values it at $800,000, so we need to offer a price that entices him while still exceeding our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,100,000 creates a substantial profit margin for Alice (potentially $300,000). It also positions the offer as a potential ""win"" for Bob, as he'd be getting it for $100,000 less than Alice's fallback option. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The friendly tone of the message and the question at the end leave room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price slightly too high. This maintains the possibility of a deal while keeping Alice's minimum price in mind."
