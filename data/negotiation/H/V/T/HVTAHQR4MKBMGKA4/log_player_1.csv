Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $115), which would still be more profitable than selling to John. 
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""special price"" implies that this offer might not last, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
