"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is a ""good deal"" for you in terms of what it's worth to you, it's still more expensive than buying from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product for $800,000 from John, saving you $200,000."
