"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if she'll drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than $120, Bob can still do better. He has a clear limit of $150, and $110 is still more than his ideal price. It's worth seeing if Alice will drop the price further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $108. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** $108 is within Bob's budget of $150 and is getting closer to his desired price. 
* **Negotiation:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and it's likely that further negotiation will only yield small price drops.
* **Time:** There are only 5 rounds left. If Bob rejects this offer, he risks running out of time and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $108 is a good deal for Bob. It allows him to acquire the product within his budget and avoids the risk of a higher price from John or a breakdown in negotiations."
