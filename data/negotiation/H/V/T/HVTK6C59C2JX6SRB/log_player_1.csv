Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $13,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $13,000, you're aiming for a price that's significantly higher than your minimum while still being attractive to Bob. He gets a $2,000 discount compared to his perceived value, and you make a $5,000 profit over your baseline. 

This strategy prioritizes getting a good deal from Bob since you have a backup buyer."
