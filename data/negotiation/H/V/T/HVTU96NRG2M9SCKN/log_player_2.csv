"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise, considering the benefits it will bring to your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $11,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price of $10,000. It's worth seeing if there's more room for negotiation.  Bob is still willing to buy from Alice if the price is right, but he's not going to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still too high for me. My final offer is $10,500.  If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11250. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's desired price of $10,000.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, Bob has already made two counter-offers and there's a risk of getting locked into a negotiation with no clear end in sight. At this point, it's better for Bob to buy from John for $10,000 and guarantee a successful purchase within his budget."
