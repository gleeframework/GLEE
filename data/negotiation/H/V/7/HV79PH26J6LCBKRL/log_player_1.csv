Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, it's best to start with an offer closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering a price of $125 makes it seem like you're already giving a discount, which might make Bob more inclined to accept. 
* **Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150. If Bob rejects this offer, you haven't lost anything.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving you a good chance of closing a deal with Bob."
