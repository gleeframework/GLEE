"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. That's a pretty good deal for her, but not the best for me.  I'm willing to pay up to $100, but I'm going to try and get a better price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's still a good deal for Alice (she's making a profit of $10), but it's closer to my target price of $80. This gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much."
