Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is still significantly above what the product is worth to him, but it also leaves some room for negotiation if he's willing to pay more. 

I chose this price because it allows me to potentially earn a good profit while still having a reasonable chance of reaching an agreement with Bob. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $105. This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this shows good faith and could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $98 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'd like to earn.  To ensure I don't lose out on a potentially better deal, I'm choosing to sell to John for $120.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, this guarantees I meet my minimum goal and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
