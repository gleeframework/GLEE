Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the negotiations at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value for the product. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product and would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
