Round 2

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $10,250?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently hovering above your $10,000 limit. While she might come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll drop to a price that beats John's offer. You have a guaranteed option with John, so it makes sense to take it now and avoid potentially overpaying."
