"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $10,250?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!",10250.0,Alice,5,
