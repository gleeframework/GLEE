Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable piece, worth significantly more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer balances a few things:

* **It's below my minimum:**  I'm still making a profit above my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** The price is below what the product is worth to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation, which increases the chance of a deal.

I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup. If Bob rejects this offer, I can assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile or if I should go with John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum. While it's tempting to secure a sale quickly, I need to prioritize my financial goals.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target. This will allow me to continue negotiating and see if I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'll keep John's offer as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stay above my minimum:** $800,000 is still above my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Be appealing to Bob:**  It's a significant increase from Bob's offer and closer to his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Show flexibility:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.

By offering $800,000, I'm pushing for a deal that's closer to my goal while still being open to discussion. This approach balances my need to maximize profit with the potential of securing a sale with Bob."
