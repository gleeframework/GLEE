"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  This product is worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $600,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $900,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still too low for me. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This offer is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,5,
