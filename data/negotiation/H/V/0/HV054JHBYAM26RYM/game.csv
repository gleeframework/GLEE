"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet the asking price. Would it be possible to negotiate a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is still a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still not able to meet the price at $1400000. I'm willing to consider $1350000 as a potential compromise. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1375000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal and make this happen!",1375000.0,Alice,5,
