"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product here that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident this product can bring you significant returns. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High initial offer:** Starting high gives me room to negotiate down while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting the potential returns for Bob creates incentive for him to consider my offer seriously. 
* **Limited opportunity:** Creating a sense of urgency could encourage Bob to accept or at least counteroffer quickly. 
* **Reserve price:**  I'm aware I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so I won't accept anything below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet the asking price. Would it be possible to negotiate a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, indicating potential for a better deal.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 10 rounds total, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Value of the product:** I believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000, so there's still room to negotiate.

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is still a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiating down:** My counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while maintaining my leverage. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to meet me halfway. 
* **Compromise language:**  Using phrases like ""compromise"" and ""find a solution"" makes the negotiation sound more collaborative and increases the likelihood of a deal. 
* **Strategic pricing:**  $1,400,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, creating a clear compromise point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still not able to meet the price at $1400000. I'm willing to consider $1350000 as a potential compromise. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still higher than what I'd receive from John. 
* **Negotiation progress:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has increased his offer.
* **Potential for better deal:** There's still room for Bob to move up, and I'm willing to explore those possibilities. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This shows good faith and demonstrates a willingness to compromise, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Reiterating value:** I continue to remind Bob of the product's worth to encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency:**  By using phrases like ""finalize this deal"" and ""make this happen,"" I add a sense of urgency to encourage a quick decision.
