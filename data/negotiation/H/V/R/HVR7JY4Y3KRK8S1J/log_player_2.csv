Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I've got to make a profit. I can do $14,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see that $13,000 is a good compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $13,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's unlikely you'll get a much better deal from Alice, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
