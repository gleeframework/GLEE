"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice's offer of $135 is within your budget. It's a better deal than buying from John."
