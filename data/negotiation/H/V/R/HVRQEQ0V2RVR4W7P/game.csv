"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get out of it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1200000 is significantly lower than the value I'm placing on this product.  To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the potential this product holds while also acknowledging your budget considerations. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get out of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
