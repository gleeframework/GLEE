"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming for a high initial price to see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm countering with $1,650,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable counteroffer and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round.  I still have time and I'm not desperate to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm countering with $1,500,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price, considering Bob's previous offer and the fact that we are nearing the midpoint of the negotiation. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price but it's still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm not desperate to sell at this point and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm countering with $1,450,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and be willing to close the deal. We are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it's possible that Bob is getting closer to his maximum willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.

We've reached the end of our negotiation with Bob, and his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is not beneficial to me. John's offer is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so it's the best option for me at this point."
