Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that allows Bob to gain a $150,000 advantage over its perceived value to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

**Important Note:** This assumes I cannot negotiate with John for a higher price. If negotiation with John were possible, my strategy might shift to using his offer as leverage to push Bob closer to my $1,200,000 minimum."
