"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is getting closer, but  I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",10000.0,Alice,5,
