"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the game. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below it. I'm not willing to sell at a loss, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $10,000. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. This keeps the negotiations moving while staying above my minimum value.  I'm hopeful Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me closer to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is finally above my minimum value of $10,000. While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and ensures a sale.  There's also a possibility that Bob will not improve his offer further, so it's a good strategy to take the deal."
