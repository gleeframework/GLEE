"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which reflects a significant discount on the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This offer reflects my budget constraints while acknowledging the value of your product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still too far from what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, I'm getting close to my limit.  Would you consider $990,000?  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're reaching your limit, but $990,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,005,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1005000.0,Alice,7,
