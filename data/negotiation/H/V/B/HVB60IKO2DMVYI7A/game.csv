"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the value I'm willing to pay, I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a fair price that allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  To make this a deal, I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This offer reflects the product's true worth and potential.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
