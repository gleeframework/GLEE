"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $9,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's closer to my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but gives Bob room to bargain. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to close the deal quickly, but also maximize my profit. By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially push him to offer a higher counteroffer. I also have the option of going to John if Bob rejects my offer, so I'm not locked into a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay a significantly higher price.  

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially push him higher. I have 8 more rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,200 is a good price, it's not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to go down to $8,800. This gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,200). 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a good deal for both of us. 
* **Building Momentum:** I'm staying firm on my desire to earn more, but also showing flexibility to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

**Strategy:**

My aim is to continue negotiating and inch closer to my goal while keeping Bob engaged. By showing a willingness to compromise, I hope to avoid him walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8,800 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,400? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:** $8,400 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's tempting to close the deal, I believe there's more room for negotiation.
* **John is a Safety Net:** I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $9,000. The goal is to get the best possible price without risking the deal by pushing too hard."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet at $8,600? That's closer to your offer, and it gives me a little more to work with. Let me know if that's something you can agree on."", ""product_price"": 8600} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise by moving slightly closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Fairness:** $8,600 is a fair midpoint between my previous offer ($8,800) and Bob's latest offer ($8,400).
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

I believe $8,600 is a reasonable price that allows me to make a decent profit while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. My goal is to close the deal this round while staying above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is a decent price, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm still determined to see if I can get a higher offer, and I still have 4 more rounds to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

I will continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $9,000. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $9,000. With John as a backup buyer, I have the flexibility to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for the best price, and I appreciate that. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,700, which is a fair compromise considering where we both started. It's a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8700} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm offering a smaller compromise than before, only moving $200 down from my previous offer. This shows I'm still serious about getting a good price, but I'm also willing to make a final concession. 
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm highlighting the fairness of the offer, emphasizing that it's a good deal for both of us.
* **Call to Action:** I'm explicitly asking Bob to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency. 

**Strategy:**

I believe $8,700 is a good balance between maximizing my profit and closing the deal. It's likely the last concession I'm willing to make.  By emphasizing fairness and the urgency of closing, I hope to push Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,700. I'm willing to go up to $8,600, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to two rounds left, and the negotiations are getting increasingly difficult.  
* **Still Below Target:** $8,600 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **John is a Safer Bet:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids the risk of Bob continuing to haggle. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get a better price, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and losing out on a sale is too high.  Selling to John is the most logical and profitable choice at this point."
