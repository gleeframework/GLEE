"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I highlight the value the product holds for him, making the offer more tempting.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message invites Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick and profitable deal while leaving room for Bob to feel like he got a good price. This will hopefully prevent him from rejecting outright and encourage a counteroffer that I can then work with.  If he rejects my offer, I can adjust my next offer based on his counteroffer and keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and is also less than my initial offer.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay more than $8,000, suggesting there's room for further negotiation.
* **Strategic negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to potentially secure a better price.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $12,000, showing I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:** I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway him toward my offer.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm using an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer again. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our desired prices. By showing flexibility while maintaining a firm stance, I hope to reach a mutually acceptable price and close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,000. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $15,000 I can get from John.
* **Time is running out:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic about my offers to maximize my profit. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob's persistence in negotiating suggests he might be willing to pay more if I push further.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $10,000, trying to close the gap while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm raising my offer to $10,500, indicating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin. 
* **Finding a middle ground:** This offer represents a midpoint between my last offer and Bob's, suggesting a genuine attempt to reach an agreement.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" Bob would be getting, appealing to his desire for a good price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our expectations and bring us closer to a mutually acceptable price. With only five rounds remaining, I need to show flexibility while remaining assertive in achieving a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget with each offer.  Let's aim for $10,250.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my limits.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited time:** We're down to four rounds left, and I need to be strategic to ensure I maximize my profit.
* **Potential for a better offer:** Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests he might be willing to pay more if I hold firm.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $10,250, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try $10,350. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to continue moving toward a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** I'm increasing my offer by a small amount ($100), showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. This avoids a significant jump that might scare Bob away.
* **Framing as compromise:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to push for a price closer to my desired range while remaining open to reaching a mutually acceptable agreement. With three rounds remaining, I need to balance firmness with flexibility to secure a good price."
