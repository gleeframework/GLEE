"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There are rounds to go, so Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, and is still within Bob's budget.  It's a starting point for further negotiations, and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still not ideal. He has rounds remaining and can likely negotiate further. Bob should continue trying to reach a price closer to his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,000. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm in his negotiation strategy. He's showing a willingness to compromise by offering a price in the middle between his previous offer and Alice's offer, making it more likely for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best possible deal and save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is a good offer, he can potentially negotiate further and reach a price closer to his budget. With 5 rounds remaining, he has time to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget with each offer.  Let's aim for $10,250.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my limits.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to slowly reduce the price while staying within his budget. Offering $10,250 shows a commitment to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. This approach could lead to a successful negotiation with a few more rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try $10,350. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to continue moving toward a deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,350 is closer to Bob's target, it's still slightly above his budget.  With only 3 rounds remaining, the likelihood of negotiating down to his $8,000 target is low.  The risk of continuing the negotiation is that Alice might not budge further, and Bob will be left with no deal.  To avoid this risk, and secure the product for his maximum budget, Bob should buy it from John."
