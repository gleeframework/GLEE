Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and to ensure a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, and I won't accept less than $1,200,000. The offer of $1,150,000 splits the difference and creates a strong incentive for Bob to accept. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays involved with John, even if the price is slightly lower.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob while retaining the safety net of John's offer."
