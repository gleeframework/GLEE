"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is within your budget, it's still quite a high price. You want to save as much money as possible, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can also consider the possibility that Alice may be willing to negotiate further if you reject her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. You're offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially profitable for her, given that her minimum acceptable price is $800,000. This counteroffer shows that you're serious about buying the product but are also trying to get the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your ideal price, and it's getting closer to John's offer. It's worth continuing the negotiation, as there's still potential for a better deal with Alice. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but she's still holding firm on a price that's too high. This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to her last offer but staying within your desired price range. It shows that you're serious about the product but not willing to overpay. The goal is to find a middle ground that works for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, and we are running out of rounds. It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John. There's a chance that Alice might be willing to budge further, especially if she wants to close the deal. Rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Alice's last offer is still very close to John's price.  This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, but it's still well within your budget and could potentially be accepted by Alice.  It shows that you are willing to meet her halfway, but you're still trying to get the best deal possible. This could be the final offer before going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now just $5,000 less than John's price.  We're running out of rounds and the potential for further negotiation is slim.  It's not worth risking a deal falling through with Alice and potentially ending up with nothing.  Buying from John ensures that you get the product within your budget, even if it's not the ideal price."
