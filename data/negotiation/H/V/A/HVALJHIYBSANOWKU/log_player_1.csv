"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
