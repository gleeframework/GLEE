# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair starting point given its potential worth to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both her value and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. It's worth seeing if she'll go lower before accepting or resorting to John's offer."

Alice has set a firm floor at $1,100,000. While I could try to haggle a little more, the difference is getting small enough that it's probably not worth the risk of her backing out. $1,125,000 is a reasonable price, especially compared to John's offer."
