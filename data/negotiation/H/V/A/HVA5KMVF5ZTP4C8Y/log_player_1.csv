Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident this is still a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $105 is a good compromise, and I'm getting closer to my desired price point.  It's also significantly better than selling to John for $80."
