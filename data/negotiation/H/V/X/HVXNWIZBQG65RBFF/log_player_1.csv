Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping me well above my minimum price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing me at least $80. This allows me to confidently aim higher with Bob."
