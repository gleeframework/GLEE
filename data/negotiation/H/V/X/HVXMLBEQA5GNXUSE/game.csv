,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $125. How about we meet at $115? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go back to $125, but I'm willing to meet you at $118. That's as close as I can get to your original offer of $120.",118.0,Bob,6,
