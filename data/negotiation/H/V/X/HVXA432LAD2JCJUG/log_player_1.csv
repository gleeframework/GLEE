"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Could you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your price point, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $115? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about $112? I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest one. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum price point, I still think I can get a slightly better deal. I'm also holding out hope that Bob might realize the value of the product and be willing to go higher.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $113. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 113}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad you're willing to come down in price. However, I'm still not quite there yet. How about $109? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $109 is getting a bit too close to my minimum, I'm determined to see if I can get a better deal. It's possible that Bob will realize that he's not getting a good deal if he keeps rejecting my offers.  I'm not going to sell to John yet.  I'm confident that I can close a deal with Bob in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $109 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $111? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 111}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not comfortable with $111. How about $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a better deal with Bob, it's getting to the point where I'm not confident I can get a deal that's worth it to me.  John is a reliable buyer and I can guarantee myself a fair price."
