"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living, and $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit. $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
