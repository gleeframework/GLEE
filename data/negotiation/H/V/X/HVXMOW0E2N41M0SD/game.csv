"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,10500.0
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,500? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $10,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Could you do $9,500?  I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500 just yet. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. How about we try $10,000? It's a great price for a product like this, and I think you'll find it's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept it just yet. I've been thinking, and I'm willing to meet you at $10,250. It's a bit higher than my previous offers, but I think it's a fair price for this product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",10250.0,Alice,7,,
