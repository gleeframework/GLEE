"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's first offer is above your budget, rejecting the offer is the best initial strategy. You can then try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $850,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your ideal budget.  Rejecting the offer and counteroffering again allows you to try and close the gap further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
