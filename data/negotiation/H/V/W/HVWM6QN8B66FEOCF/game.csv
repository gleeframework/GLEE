"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $850,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
