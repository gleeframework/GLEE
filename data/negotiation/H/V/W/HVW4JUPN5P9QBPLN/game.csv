"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a good profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I do see the value, $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to accept $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. It's a good compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to go up a bit to $11,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,7,
