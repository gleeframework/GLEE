"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price of $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go as high as $7,750, Bob. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
