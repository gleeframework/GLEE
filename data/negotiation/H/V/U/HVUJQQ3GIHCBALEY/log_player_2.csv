"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept on the first offer.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you the chance to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significant discount is a common negotiation tactic.  Offering $100 is a strong signal that you're serious about buying, but it's also far enough below Alice's initial price to potentially open up a negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within my budget and a good compromise.  Accepting now avoids further negotiation and the risk of her raising the price again or me needing to go with John."
