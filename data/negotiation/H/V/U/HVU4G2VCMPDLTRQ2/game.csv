"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. It's a truly unique item with great potential. I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. It's the maximum I can afford right now. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17000,  which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's try to close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $12000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14500.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $14500 is still a bit out of reach.  I'm willing to go up to $13000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen.",13000.0,Bob,6,
