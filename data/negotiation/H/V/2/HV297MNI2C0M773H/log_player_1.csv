Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you're in a strong position. Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation and still ensures a profit above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, framing it as a premium investment worthy of the higher price. 
* **Exclusivity:**  By calling it an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you create a sense of scarcity and urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're willing to risk Bob rejecting the initial offer. If you want to secure a sale with Bob for certain, a price closer to $1,200,000 would be more appropriate."
