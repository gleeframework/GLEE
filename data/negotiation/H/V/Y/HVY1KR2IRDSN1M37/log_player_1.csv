Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you have a safety net. This allows you to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a price of $10,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also firmly positions the product as having a high value in your mind.
* **Clear Expectations:** The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach avoids lengthy back-and-forth negotiations, which can be time-consuming and potentially decrease the perceived value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is prone to haggling, a slightly lower starting price might be more strategic.
* **Market Context:** This assumes you have no information about how Bob might perceive the product's value beyond $8,000. If you had additional market insights, you could adjust your approach."
