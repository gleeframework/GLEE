"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but lower than the maximum I could potentially get from John ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to negotiate towards a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Positive Messaging:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable,  it's clear he's interested in the product. I can likely negotiate a higher price in the next round. 
* **Not selling to John yet:** Selling to John for $150 would be a safe option, but I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. That's a good price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $175 to $130. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us with this price. 
* **Urgency:** I'm suggesting we ""close the deal"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Maintaining My Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's meet in the middle at $115. I'm sure we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $115 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is still too low, it's a slight improvement from his previous offer, and there's still potential for a better deal.
* **Not selling to John yet:**  I'd prefer to continue negotiations with Bob, but I'm approaching the point where selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. How about $125? That's closer to your offer and still a fair price for the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down to $125, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:** I'm suggesting we ""make this happen"" to incentivize Bob to finalize the deal.
* **Balancing Risk:**  This offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to take a slight risk because selling to John for $150 is always an option if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close this deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is running out:** We're approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds, and I need to ensure I get a price that's fair to me. 
* **John is a backup:**  I'm willing to take a slight risk by rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm confident I can get a better price, or I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $122? It's only $2 more than your offer, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal now!"", ""product_price"": 122} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Compromise:** I'm making a small concession, only raising my price by $2 from Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum.
* **Finality:** I'm using phrases like ""halfway"" and ""close this deal now"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Focusing on Fairness:** I'm reminding Bob that $122 is a ""fair compromise"" to help him see the value in accepting.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, so this offer is a final push to reach a deal before I have to consider selling to John."
