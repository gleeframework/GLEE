"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. That's a good price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's meet in the middle at $115. I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. How about $125? That's closer to your offer and still a fair price for the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close this deal. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $122? It's only $2 more than your offer, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal now!",122.0,Alice,7,
