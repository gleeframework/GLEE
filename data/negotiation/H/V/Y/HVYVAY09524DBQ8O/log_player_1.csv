Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I think it would be a valuable asset to you, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's enticing but still profitable for her.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $14,500 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price. 

**Why this strategy is strong:**

* **High starting point:** It anchors the negotiation closer to Alice's desired price.
* **Potential for agreement:** The offer is still within a reasonable range for Bob to consider.
* **No risk of losing the sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John at her minimum price."
