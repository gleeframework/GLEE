Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $175."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $150, we don't want to sell it for less than our minimum ($150).  Offering it for $175 attempts to maximize profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects our offer, we don't lose out.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** The $175 offer leaves a little room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, getting us closer to his perceived value while still exceeding our minimum."
