Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $10,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $9,500. It's a compromise that's closer to my minimum price, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle again!

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I need the price to come down a bit more. Would you consider $8,000? That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $9,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

```

Alice is unlikely to go below $9,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 than risk Alice not budging and missing out on a better deal."
