"I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $10,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $9,500. It's a compromise that's closer to my minimum price, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle again!",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need the price to come down a bit more. Would you consider $8,000? That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $9,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,7,
