"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This price is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
