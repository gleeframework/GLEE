Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it allows room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more.  I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I get a fair price for the product."
