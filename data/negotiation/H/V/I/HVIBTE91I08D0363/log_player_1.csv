{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm framing the offer as a starting point, implying flexibility. 

This approach balances maximizing my potential earnings with keeping the negotiation open and engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which is my maximum limit. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:**  While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell at this point. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  There's still a chance Bob might be willing to pay more. By rejecting his offer, I can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I'm keeping the negotiation open, which gives me a chance to improve my position. 

I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and potential benefits to you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not caving:**  I'm offering a compromise by dropping the price, but I'm still above Bob's initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and its potential benefits to him, hoping to justify the higher price.
* **Fairness and compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise and suggesting a meeting in the middle. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while giving me a better chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm going to stick with my initial offer of $10000.  It's my maximum budget, and I'm hoping you'll reconsider. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is firm on his $10,000 offer, and I've already lowered my price significantly. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort without any guarantee of a higher price.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

While I'd prefer to get more for the product, it's not worth risking a lower price or wasting time on a negotiation that's likely to be unproductive."
