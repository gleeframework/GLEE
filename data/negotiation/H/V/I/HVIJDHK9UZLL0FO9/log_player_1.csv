Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell at that price, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still offers you a substantial profit, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I've considered it, and I'd like to propose $900,000. This brings us closer to a mutually acceptable price while still allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $900,000 is a good price for me, considering the time constraints of the negotiation and the risk of losing a deal completely.  I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
