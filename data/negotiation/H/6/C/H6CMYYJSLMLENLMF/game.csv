"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I see the potential value in this product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,000 though.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to go with $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
