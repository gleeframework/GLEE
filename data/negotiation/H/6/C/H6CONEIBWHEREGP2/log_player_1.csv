"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. This gives me room to negotiate and also sets the tone for me as the seller with the power in this situation. I'm also including a friendly message to make the negotiation feel more personal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $95.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm lowering the price to $95, which is still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing that it's a fair price for both of us to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $90.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I've already lowered my price twice, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to go any higher.  Instead of continuing to negotiate, I'm going to take the guaranteed $100 from John. It's a better outcome for me than continuing to bargain with Bob."
