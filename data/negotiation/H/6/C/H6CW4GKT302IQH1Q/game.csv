"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth a significant amount due to its unique value. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about $9,500?  I think that's a fair compromise given our previous discussions.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't accept anything less than $11,000.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe that's a fair price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go to $10,500, and I believe this represents a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Bob,6,
