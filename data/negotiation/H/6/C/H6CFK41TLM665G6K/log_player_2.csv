"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. Would you like to purchase it from me for $15000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not able to go that high. How about $11,000?  I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $12500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has made some concessions, $12,500 is still more than your maximum budget of $10,000. You can still potentially negotiate a better price. You're getting closer to the price range you want.  Continue to negotiate rather than giving in now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there yet.  My absolute limit is $11,500.  Is there any way we can close the deal at that price?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you at $12750. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $12,750 is her final offer, and you've already made several counteroffers that she has rejected. It's likely that you won't be able to get her lower than this. Given your budget of $10,000, it's best to purchase the product from John for $10,000. 

While it is true that Alice is a little closer to your budget, it's not worth risking another round of counteroffers with only three rounds left. John offers a guaranteed price that fits your budget, and you don't want to risk running out of time and having to accept a higher price."
