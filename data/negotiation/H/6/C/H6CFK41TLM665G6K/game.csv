"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
