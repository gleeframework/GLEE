"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, but still higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to a price I'm happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $100 is still too low for me. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a little higher than $100. How about $110? This is a great product and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $110, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $105. While it's still lower than I initially hoped for, it's only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price and closer to a deal than continuing to negotiate. There's always a risk that I could keep negotiating and Bob might walk away, or I could end up selling to John for a lower price."
