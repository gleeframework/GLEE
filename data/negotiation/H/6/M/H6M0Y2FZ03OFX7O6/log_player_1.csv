"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you reaching out.  However, $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it, as that's what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to budge above his perceived value of the product ($120).  Since my minimum acceptable price is also $120, there's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob. I'm better off taking the guaranteed $120 from John."
