"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits it can bring.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for your maximum price. You have no leverage in this situation. Rejecting the offer allows you to buy from John at the same price, but it leaves open the possibility of Alice lowering her price if she wants to close the deal."
