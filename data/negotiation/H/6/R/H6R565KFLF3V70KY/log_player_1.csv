"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price. While I'd love to get closer to my true valuation, I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway right off the bat. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, and also allows me to quickly move on to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't give away the product for such a significant loss. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, showing my willingness to compromise.  It's also a good starting point for further negotiation, as it's closer to Bob's offer than my initial one. This should hopefully lead to a quicker conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it's still too far below my valuation. I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm not going to accept anything significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a smaller step down from my previous offer, showing that I'm coming closer to Bob's valuation. It's also a good halfway point between our current offers, and hopefully, we can reach a compromise quickly. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reconsider my position and perhaps explore selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable.  I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, but I'm running out of time. If I don't get a better offer soon, I'll likely go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm offering $1,025,000. This is a smaller decrease from my previous offer and shows my continued willingness to negotiate. It's also closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding on to a good portion of my desired value. This is my last offer before considering John's deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut my losses.  Bob isn't getting close to my minimum price, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to accept John's offer and get a guaranteed $1,200,000 than to risk ending up with a much lower amount from Bob."
