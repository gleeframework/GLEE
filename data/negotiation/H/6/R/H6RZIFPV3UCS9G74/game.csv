"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what I value it at and still leaves you with a substantial profit margin. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This still gives you a good deal and allows me to recover some of my costs.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not able to go as low as $7,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This would give you a good deal while allowing me to recover a reasonable portion of my costs.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
