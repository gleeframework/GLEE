Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his valuation is $1,000,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers adds a level of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, this offer still secures a much higher profit than the $800,000 backup offer from John."
