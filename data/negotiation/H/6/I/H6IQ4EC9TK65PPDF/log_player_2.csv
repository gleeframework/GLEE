"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Since you have a backup option with John, it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would still be a good profit for you, and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit below my minimum. Let's compromise - I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000.  This would still give you a significant value, and allows me to stay above my minimum. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a good price for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will refuse and Bob might end up paying $1,200,000 to John. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price and avoids unnecessary risk."
