"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would still be a good profit for you, and allows me to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit below my minimum. Let's compromise - I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000.  This would still give you a significant value, and allows me to stay above my minimum. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
