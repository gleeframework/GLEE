"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $950,000 is not a good option. Buying from John for $800,000 is a safe option, but Bob wants to save as much money as possible. So, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum price as possible. A starting counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and might incentivize her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still higher than his ideal price. He has more rounds to negotiate and can try to lower the price further.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, hoping to find a middle ground with Alice. $750,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer of $820,000 is close to Bob's maximum budget, it's still not ideal. He has several rounds left and can attempt to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000} 
```

Bob is getting closer to his maximum limit. He's increasing his offer again, but this time by a smaller margin, showing his seriousness in closing the deal. $780,000 is a strong counteroffer, indicating that he's willing to pay a significant price but still wants to save as much as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $800,000 is now at Bob's maximum limit.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product while staying within his budget.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, and he could end up buying from John at the same price, losing valuable negotiation time."
