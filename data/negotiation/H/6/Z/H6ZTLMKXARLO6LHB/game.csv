"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $14,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying.  How about we settle on $15,500?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $15,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $16,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16250.0,Alice,5,
