"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below her product valuation, it's still more than you want to pay. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure a better deal with John and save $150,000."
