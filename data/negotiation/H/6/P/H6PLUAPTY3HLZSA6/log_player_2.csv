# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?
