"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I know you've been looking for, and I'm confident it would significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000 
* **Alice's value:** $1,200,000

You can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer."
