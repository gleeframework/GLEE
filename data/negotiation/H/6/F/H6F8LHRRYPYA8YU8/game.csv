"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is a respectable offer, the value this product brings to the table is significantly higher. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth and our mutual benefit.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
