"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $12000? I'm confident it's a fair price considering what I'm looking for.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500 to make this work.  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,
