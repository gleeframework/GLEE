"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $175.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $140 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155?  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you could still potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $155 is still a little out of my price range.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 150}
