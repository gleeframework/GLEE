"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price.  $920,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $935,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,
