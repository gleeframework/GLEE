{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is still below my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to make the price seem more reasonable. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've achieved a good outcome and can move on to the sale.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* **If negotiations stall:** I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does indicate that he's interested in the product. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **Counteroffering strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that's more advantageous to me. This will either lead to a successful negotiation or give me the opportunity to sell to John at a higher price.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value while still being realistic and negotiable.
* **Evaluate Bob's response:**  I will carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer and determine whether to accept, reject, or continue negotiating.
* **Sell to John if necessary:** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall or lead to an unacceptable offer, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to secure my minimum desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $950,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is still fair considering the product's potential, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiations. 

**Next steps:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer, we can finalize the deal at $1,050,000. This is a decent outcome for me, as it's close to my target price.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will assess the situation carefully. Depending on his response and my urgency to sell, I may either:
    * **Make another counteroffer:** If I believe we can reach an agreement, I'll make a final counteroffer, potentially closer to his offer.
    * **Sell to John:** If negotiations seem futile, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still slightly beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us to finalize the deal. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's maximum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is his absolute maximum, meaning there is little room for further negotiation. 
* **Achieving a good outcome:** While $1,000,000 is not my ideal price, it is still within my acceptable range.  It would be a loss of $200,000 compared to selling to John, but it would allow for a faster sale and potentially save me time and effort in further negotiations.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations could potentially lead to a higher offer from Bob, but it also risks losing the deal entirely or delaying the sale.  Accepting Bob's offer is a more conservative approach that guarantees a sale at a decent price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalize the sale:**  I will accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale, ensuring all necessary documentation and payment arrangements are in place.
* **No further negotiation:** I will not engage in any further negotiation with Bob, as his maximum offer has been reached.
* **Opportunity cost:** I will consider the opportunity cost of accepting Bob's offer versus selling to John. While it's less than my ideal price, it's still a decent outcome, and the time and effort saved could be valuable."
