"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $950,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is still fair considering the product's potential, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
