"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it provides.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'd love to accommodate your budget, we need to maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500. This price still allows us to cover our costs and ensure the quality of our product, while being more flexible than the original offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $9,750? That would make it possible for me to purchase today.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're finding common ground, Bob. After considering your proposal, I think a fair compromise would be to set the product price at $10,000. This still ensures a reasonable profit margin for us while remaining within your budget constraints. I hope this works for you, and look forward to your acceptance.",10000.0,Alice,5,
