Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit too high for me, I was thinking more along the lines of $90

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, how about we try $92?

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to $100, Bob is unlikely to offer much more. Accepting his offer of $92 is better than risking him walking away and only getting $100 from John."
