"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay a good price, since the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a good deal.  I believe Bob is motivated to buy, and this price should be within his range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $95 is a good deal and  I'm worried that if I keep rejecting offers, I might lose Bob altogether and end up selling to John for a lower price."
