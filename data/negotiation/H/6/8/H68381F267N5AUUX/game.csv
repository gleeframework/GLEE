"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $1,600,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price recognizes the product's worth while still being a good deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the value of this product is substantial, and I can't go as low as $1,100,000. My final offer is $1,175,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's more than fair considering what you're getting.  Let me know your decision.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,175,000 to me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
