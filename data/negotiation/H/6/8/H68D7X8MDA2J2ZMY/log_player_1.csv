Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing you have John as a backup to buy the product for $1,000,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys it from you for his maximum price.
* **Negotiation Power:** You have some leverage as you have a guaranteed buyer. However, aiming too high could make Bob walk away.

**Offer Strategy**

The key is to find a price that entices Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation could be a good strategy.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Profitable for You:** You're making a significant profit of $150,000 over your minimum.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  Bob still gets a good deal, saving $50,000 from his maximum valuation and securing a valuable product.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** Business negotiations are fluid. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and any additional information he might reveal."
