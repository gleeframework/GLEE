Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $1,000,000, but I'm not quite willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What are your thoughts?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than her previous offer, but still above my desired price range. I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get her closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to be clear that this is my final concession. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can both walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $1,075,000 is her final concession.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to $1,050,000,  I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John at $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
