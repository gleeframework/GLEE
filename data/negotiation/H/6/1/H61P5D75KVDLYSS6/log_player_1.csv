Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He's likely to negotiate, but it gives you room to move.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You still have a good margin of profit, even if Bob accepts.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price based on Bob's response. 

If Bob rejects, you'll still get your minimum price from John."
