"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant profit for you considering my value. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your value of the product while still providing a significant profit for me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above what I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant amount for me and still provides a good profit for you. I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us if we continue to negotiate in good faith.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. If this offer is still not acceptable to you, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to John for $1,500,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
