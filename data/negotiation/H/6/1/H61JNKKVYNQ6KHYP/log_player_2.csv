# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. If this offer is still not acceptable to you, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to John for $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still above my budget.  At this point, I'm better off buying from John for $800,000, even though it's not the ideal price.  It's a much better deal than anything Alice is offering."
