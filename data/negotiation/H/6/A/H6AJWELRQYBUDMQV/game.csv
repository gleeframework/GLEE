,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, and I think that's a good compromise.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $110. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $112. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",112.0,Alice,5,
