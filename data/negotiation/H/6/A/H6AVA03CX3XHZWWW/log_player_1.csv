{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate. At the same time, it's significantly less than my minimum value, ensuring a profit. 

This is just a starting point. I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the need to either maximize profit or reach a deal before selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $8500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but it's closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping a margin above my minimum value. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8750? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to keep negotiating in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,875.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```

I'm making a small counteroffer,  increasing my price slightly from the previous round. This shows flexibility while still attempting to secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8500? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I've already made several concessions.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it seems like we've reached a stalemate.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a sale altogether, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000 to guarantee a good return on my product."
