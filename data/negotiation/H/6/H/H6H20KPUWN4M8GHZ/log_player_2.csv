Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $120 is now at Bob's maximum budget. There is no room for further negotiation, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal to John.  Since John is also offering the product for $120, it makes sense for Bob to purchase it from John to avoid further negotiations and ensure he gets the product."
