"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  You know you can get it for $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that Alice has some value in the product, but you're trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than what you are willing to pay.  You can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, showing that you are willing to negotiate. It also leaves room for Alice to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,600 is close to your maximum price point.  Since you are running out of rounds, it's a good deal and a better option than buying from John for $10,000."
