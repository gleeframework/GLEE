Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* I don't know Bob's perceived value, so I'm taking a chance. If he values the product at or above $2,000,000, he'll accept.
* If he rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I don't lose money.

This strategy balances the risk of losing a higher price with the certainty of a minimum profit."
