Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $1,500,000?** This is a starting point that is higher than your minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a ""round"" number, which can be psychologically appealing.
* **The Importance of Negotiation:** By starting high, I'm setting the stage for potential negotiation. Bob may counter-offer with a lower price, and we can then engage in a back-and-forth to try and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** While John's offer of $1,200,000 provides a safety net, I'm not relying on it. My goal is to get a higher price from Bob if possible."
