"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to acquire this product for a bit less.  I'm ready to pay $950000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1000000? It's a fair price that considers the product's value while still allowing us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll come down to $1025000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value and my minimum price. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
