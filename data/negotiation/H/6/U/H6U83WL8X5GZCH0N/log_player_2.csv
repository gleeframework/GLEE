"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, it's worth seeing if you can get a better price. Her message tries to inflate the perceived value to you.  You have room to negotiate down from $12,000 or resort to buying from John at $15,000."
