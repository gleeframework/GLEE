"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,000 is a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit over my budget. How about $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $11,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
