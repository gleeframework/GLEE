Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a reasonable compromise between my minimum value of $120 and Bob's perceived value of $80. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product for Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a win-win scenario where I get a good price and Bob feels like he's getting a fair deal.
* By starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value, I leave room for negotiation.
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer.
* If negotiations stall, I have the option of selling to John, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider selling it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  While I understand Bob's budget, accepting $80 would be a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of us. 

**Next steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my minimum value, but still potentially appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm counteroffering with $95, which is $15 higher than Bob's offer but $25 lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but emphasize the product's value. I'm proposing a ""middle ground"" to encourage agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing act:** I'm trying to find a price that is acceptable to both of us, maximizing my profit while still keeping the negotiation open.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone helps keep the negotiation productive.
* **Option to sell to John:** I'm still aware of my option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the product's value, I believe $80 would be a fair price for both of us. Could we aim for that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:** Bob is sticking to his $80 offer, which is significantly below my minimum value of $120.  
* **No further negotiation value:**  It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge, and further negotiation is unlikely to change his mind. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and eliminates any risk of further losses.

**Strategy:**

* **Avoiding losses:**  By selling to John, I guarantee myself a profit and avoid the risk of accepting a price below my minimum value.
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation with Bob would be time-consuming and might not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
