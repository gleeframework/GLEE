Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is my bottom line. This product is highly sought after, and I'm confident in its value. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000, but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still not convinced. I would like to propose a price of $10,500. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $10,500 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has the potential for a higher price, but also risks Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value:**  Every round spent negotiating is time you could be selling to someone else or finding new opportunities. 

While you could potentially get more from Bob, $10,500 represents a good balance of profit and risk mitigation at this stage in the negotiation."
