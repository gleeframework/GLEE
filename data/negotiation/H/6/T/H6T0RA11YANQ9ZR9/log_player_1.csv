Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have the time and resources to handle potential negotiations with Bob. If you prioritize a quick and guaranteed sale, offering it directly to John at $1,200,000 is the safest approach."
