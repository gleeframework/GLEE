Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to reasonable offers."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting at $150, you can gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects it, you know he might be very price-sensitive. If he counters, you can work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a buyer at $120. This means you don't have to desperately sell to Bob and can afford to be a bit more firm in your pricing. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your own judgment during the negotiation."
