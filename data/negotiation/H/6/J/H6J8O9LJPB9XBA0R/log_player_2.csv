"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to reasonable offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $150 is significantly more than your $80 limit and far more than you need to pay. 
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $80, which meets your budget.

Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for negotiation or allows you to proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
