Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message aims to be confident in the product's value without seeming overly aggressive or greedy.  

This approach balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for securing a much higher profit than the guaranteed sale to John."
