"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your budget. There's a lot of room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, reflecting a significant discount, but still acknowledging its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is a strong starting point, significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message highlights your interest while clearly stating your budget constraint. It also offers a specific reason for the counteroffer. 
* **Room to Move:**  There's still room for Alice to counter with a higher price, which will give you the chance to make further adjustments."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget. While it's a step in the right direction, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer, potentially closer to your desired price.  Keep in mind, you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $800,000, so you don't need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still stretched. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Negotiation:**  We're pushing for a more reasonable price, showing Alice that we're serious about the product but also firm on our budget. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, suggesting we are trying to reach a compromise.
* **Staying Within Your Range:**  This offer remains below your maximum budget, providing room for further negotiations if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to your business, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired range. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving. You can counter with a slightly higher offer, potentially bridging the gap. Remember, you have a backup option with John, so you're not pressured into a hasty decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,025,000 is getting closer,  I'm still working within a tight budget. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you can see it as a step towards a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing Alice that you're willing to negotiate but are also sticking to your budget.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** The message emphasizes that this offer represents a significant compromise for you, making Alice more likely to consider it.
* **Maintaining a Realistic Goal:** This counteroffer remains within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is still not satisfied."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $975000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is still above your budget, and this is the seventh round. You have only three rounds left. At this point, it's better to secure the product from John at $800,000.  While there is a chance Alice might lower her price further, the risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
