"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate you considering me. However, $95 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $90, which is still better than John's price of $100. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal and the risk of Alice rejecting another offer and forcing Bob to buy from John is high.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a decent price."
