"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite low considering what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This reflects the product's true value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. How about we compromise at $8,200? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Would you consider $8,600? That's a significant compromise on my end.",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm getting closer to your offer, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $8,400? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget.",8400.0,Bob,6,
