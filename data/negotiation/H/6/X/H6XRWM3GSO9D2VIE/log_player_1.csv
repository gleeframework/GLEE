Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is clearly very interested and is moving closer to my acceptable range. Accepting his offer at $11,500 provides a $1,500 profit and avoids the risk of pushing him away completely."
