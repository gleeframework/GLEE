"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob, and understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find a solution that works for us both, $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.",11500.0,Bob,4,
