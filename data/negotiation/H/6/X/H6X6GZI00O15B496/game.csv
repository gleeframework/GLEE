"Alice, I understand you're looking for a bit more, but $11,200 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference at $10,800? I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to compromise. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,400? It's a small increase from your last offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price.",11400.0,Alice,5,
