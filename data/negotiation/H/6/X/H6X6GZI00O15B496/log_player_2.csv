Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,200? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

Bob is still looking to save money, and $11,200 is closer to his goal, but he can still try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to compromise. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,400? It's a small increase from your last offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400

Bob has already rejected Alice's offer of $11,400, which is getting closer to his target but still above his desired price.  The negotiation is starting to drag on, and the value of the product to Bob is only $12,000. It's now more efficient for him to buy the product from John for $12,000, avoiding further rounds of negotiation with Alice."
