"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,100,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for it. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,250,000 for the product. I'm confident you'll see the value in it and be willing to pay a premium.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
