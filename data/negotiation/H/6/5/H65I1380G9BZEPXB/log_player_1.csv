{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a good starting point to leave room for negotiation while still securing a profit. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you considering my product. $10,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm open to a compromise. How about $11,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I think I can do better. How about $11,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to take this deal to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing a sale altogether. While I could counteroffer again, there's a chance Bob might walk away and I'd be left with the less favorable option of selling to John."
