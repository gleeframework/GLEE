"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than the value I believe this product holds.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell for $1,050,000. This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about $975,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and keeps us moving towards a deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate that. However, $975,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
