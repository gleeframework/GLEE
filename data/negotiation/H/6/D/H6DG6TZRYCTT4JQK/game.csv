"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer reflects the significant value this product brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
