# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth much more to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, Alice's message hints that she's willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price and save even more money."
