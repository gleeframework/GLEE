Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
