"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high but is still below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me.  How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk he'll walk away entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
