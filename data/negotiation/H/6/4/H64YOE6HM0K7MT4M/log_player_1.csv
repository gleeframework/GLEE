Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your estimation.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're firm on the product's value, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable point, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is more than Bob is currently offering and ensures I don't waste more time negotiating."
