Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will value the product at $120, so he might be willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm confident that Bob values the product at $120 and is willing to pay more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm countering with $95. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good price.  I'm hoping this will be a fair price for both of us and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. It's better for me to secure the guaranteed $80 from John rather than potentially ending up with a lower price or a drawn-out negotiation."
