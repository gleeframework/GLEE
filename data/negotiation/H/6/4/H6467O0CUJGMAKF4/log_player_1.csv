Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $120, so he's likely to consider this a good deal.
* **It opens the door to negotiation:** This is a good starting point for a back-and-forth to see what you can ultimately agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is closer to your desired price and still a good deal for him, considering he values the product at $120. Accepting his offer is the best option in this scenario."
