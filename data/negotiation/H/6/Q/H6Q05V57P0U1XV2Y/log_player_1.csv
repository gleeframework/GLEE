"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first.  I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $200 for it."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I am only able to pay up to $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's maximum offer is equal to John's offer. It's unlikely Bob will go higher, and further negotiation risks getting stuck below $150. Accepting John's offer ensures I get the best possible price without unnecessary back-and-forth."
