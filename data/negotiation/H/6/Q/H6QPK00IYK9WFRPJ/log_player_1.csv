"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $15,000 to start negotiations.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer, as I'm happy to purchase from John if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled this is his final offer and he has an alternative buyer. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get much closer to our $12,000 walk-away price. Accepting John's offer ensures we get our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
