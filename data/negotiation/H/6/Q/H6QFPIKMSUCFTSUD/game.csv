"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair, considering its value to me and the potential savings for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
