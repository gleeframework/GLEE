# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than the $10,000 he can get from John.  Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,600 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, Bob should choose to buy from John and save $600."
