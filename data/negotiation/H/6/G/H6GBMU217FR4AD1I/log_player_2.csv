"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot, and I'm willing to make a great deal with you. I'm offering it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept the offer right away. Since you have a fallback option (buying from John), it's best to try and negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down from $150 to $135, which is within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying the full $150 to John.  Accepting her offer is the best option to secure the product at a good price."
