"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $7,750?

You have three options:

It's not worth haggling further. Alice is very slowly coming down, and it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly better than John's offer."
