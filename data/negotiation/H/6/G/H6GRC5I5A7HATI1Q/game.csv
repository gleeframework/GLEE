"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $7,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Alice,5,
