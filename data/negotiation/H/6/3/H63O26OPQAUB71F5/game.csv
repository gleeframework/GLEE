"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well below what the product is worth to you. Let's close the deal!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still finding $105 a bit high.  Would you consider $95?  That feels like a good compromise to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise.  I'm confident this is the best deal we can make, so let's finalize it!",100.0,Alice,5,
