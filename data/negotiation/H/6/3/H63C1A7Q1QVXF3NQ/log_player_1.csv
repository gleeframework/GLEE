Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After considering the value of the product, I'm willing to sell it to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $999,000}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since $850,000 is lower than my initial offer, I'm not thrilled about it. However, it's still a decent price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale. Considering the value of the product to me, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to get closer to my initial price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which is the price I was initially willing to accept. Better to take the guaranteed sale at the higher price than to continue negotiating with Bob."
