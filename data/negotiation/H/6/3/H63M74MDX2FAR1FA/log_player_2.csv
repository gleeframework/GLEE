{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The offer from Alice is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate further.  You have room to lower the price with Alice, potentially saving a lot of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a bold counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000

Alice has moved a little, but it's still worthwhile to see if we can get the price down further.  We're still far from John's price."

We're increasing our counteroffer slightly, showing Alice that we're serious about a deal but still trying to get a good price. This shows that we're willing to negotiate but not willing to go too high yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it would be ideal to get the price down further, Alice's offer is getting close to our target, and we've already been through several rounds of negotiation.  Accepting this offer will save us a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
