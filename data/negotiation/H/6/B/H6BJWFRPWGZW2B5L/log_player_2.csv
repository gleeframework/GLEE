Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you have a fallback option with John for $12,000, rejecting Alice's offer of $15,000 is the best choice. You can then make a counteroffer to Alice and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay from John.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a better price."
