I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$11,000 is below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows a willingness to negotiate and hopefully helps us find a middle ground."
