"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but not so high that it seems unreasonable right away. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but also maintains my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is just above my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting it would secure a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  it's important to balance potential gain with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
