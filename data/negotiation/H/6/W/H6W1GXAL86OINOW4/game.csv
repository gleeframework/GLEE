"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $11,000 is tempting, but I'd really like to see if we can get a bit closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering its value to you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
