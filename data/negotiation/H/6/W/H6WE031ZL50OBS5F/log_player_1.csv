{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if needed, but also demonstrates that I'm serious about selling the product.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer is still a good deal for me, but I'm not desperate. I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the next round."

While $1,080,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm determined to get as close to my initial offer as possible. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting lower, and we are running out of time. I'm not willing to drop my price any further, and I'm worried that Bob will continue to lowball me. With only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a good deal is too high.  It's time to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
