"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer is high enough to encourage Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation:**  I have 10 rounds, so there's still plenty of time to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure my minimum price by selling to John. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that's still higher than Bob's but shows flexibility. I'm using the ""value to me"" argument to justify my price point.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and focusing on reaching an agreement.
* **Leaving Room for More Negotiation:** $950,000 still leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired target.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  With 6 rounds left, I believe there's still room to push for a higher price.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can still secure a much higher price by selling to John. This gives me the confidence to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $925,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Move Closer:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency without Pressure:** I'm suggesting a deal to move things forward, but not creating a sense of urgency or pressure. This helps avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $925,000. I'm thinking $915,000 is a fair price for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While $915,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, there's still some room for improvement.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  I have 4 rounds left.  This gives me time to continue negotiating.
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure a much higher price by selling to John. This provides leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting close.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $920,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 920000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm counter-offering with a price that is exactly in between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a strong desire to reach an agreement.
* **Appealing to Shared Value:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" that considers the value to both of us, emphasizing the win-win nature of the deal.
* **Urgency Without Pressure:**  I'm using phrases like ""close the deal"" and ""let's meet in the middle"" to create a sense of urgency, but without applying pressure. This encourages Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $920,000. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but no higher. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We're in round 8, with only two rounds remaining.
* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's still below my desired target.
* **John's Offer is More Advantageous:**  By selling to John for $1,200,000, I can secure a much better price than I could achieve with Bob.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks not reaching an agreement, leading to a lost sale.

Selling to John guarantees a significant profit and minimizes the risk of a failed negotiation."
