# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself in the long run. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $600000 is below my minimum expectation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering the product for $850000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to recover a significant portion of the product's value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice's offer is still above my budget. Even though it's closer to my maximum, I'm comfortable paying John's $800,000 price and avoid further negotiation."
