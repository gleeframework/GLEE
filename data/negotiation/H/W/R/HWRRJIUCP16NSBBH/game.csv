"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,750?  That feels like a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $9,000 is the highest I'm comfortable going. If you're unable to do that, I might need to explore other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $9,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,7,
