"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I think it's still a good deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another seller.",12000.0,Bob,4,
