"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. My offer is $900,000. This is a fair price that respects your value for the product while ensuring I receive a favorable outcome. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
