"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects a significant discount, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my finances.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to go down to $930,000.  This represents a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's aim for a win-win situation.",930000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on funds. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I need to be at $915,000 or lower to make it work. Can you consider one more concession?",915000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference: $922,500.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. I'm confident we can close this deal.",922500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider one last concession?",915000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for you.  However, $915,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to be at $920,000 to make this work. It's the best I can do, and it's still a great deal for you.  If you're not able to go that high, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.",920000.0,Alice,9,
