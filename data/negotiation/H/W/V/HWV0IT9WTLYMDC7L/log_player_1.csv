"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I don't want to be too aggressive and risk him rejecting my offer outright. 
* **Being friendly:** Using a friendly tone helps to build rapport and encourage Bob to negotiate. 
* **Setting a baseline:** If Bob rejects my offer, I have a starting point for future counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum, $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.
* **I want to see if I can push for a higher price:** I have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer gives me more leverage in the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects a significant discount, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $950,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the ""significant discount"" emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to discussion:** I end with a statement that encourages further negotiation, keeping the door open for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **I have time to negotiate further:** With 6 rounds left, I have ample opportunity to try and reach a price closer to my target.
* **John is a strong backup:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I know I can sell to John for a significantly higher price if needed."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to go down to $930,000.  This represents a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's aim for a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession to show I'm willing to negotiate, but staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting compromise:** Emphasize the ""fair compromise"" and the ""win-win situation"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Creating urgency:**  Suggesting that we aim for a ""win-win situation"" subtly implies that if we don't reach an agreement, we may not be able to move forward. 
* **Staying above minimum:** $930,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob feels he's getting a good deal, while I'm still getting a price closer to my target.
* With each round, I'm making smaller concessions to signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* The threat of selling to John for a higher price remains a strong bargaining chip."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on funds. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I need to be at $915,000 or lower to make it work. Can you consider one more concession? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $915,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is progressing:**  Even though Bob is pushing for a lower price, he's showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise. 
* **Time is on my side:**  With 4 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating and potentially push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John remains an option:**  If Bob doesn't meet my price, I have a guaranteed sale to John for a significantly higher amount.

**Strategy:**

* I'll continue to make small concessions, but I won't drop below my minimum.
* I'll try to leverage the fact that I have John as a backup buyer to encourage Bob to make a more favorable offer."

* I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to make another small concession in the next round if needed.
* I'm still keeping John as a backup option, but I'm optimistic that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for you.  However, $915,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to be at $920,000 to make this work. It's the best I can do, and it's still a great deal for you.  If you're not able to go that high, I'll have to move forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 920000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:**  I'm emphasizing this is my final offer to create urgency and potential pressure on Bob.
* **Maintaining minimum:** $920,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Threat of selling to John:**  I'm reminding Bob of the alternative buyer, emphasizing the risk of losing the deal.

* I'm hoping Bob will recognize that my minimum is $920,000 and accept my offer. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to John to ensure I get at least my minimum acceptable price."
