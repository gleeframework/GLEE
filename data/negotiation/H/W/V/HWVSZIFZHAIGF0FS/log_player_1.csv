Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $14,000 is lower than what Bob is willing to pay ($15,000), making it attractive to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can still go lower, and if he accepts, you've made a good profit.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response, and you have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum of $12,000. While it's tempting to accept as it's better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000. This will give me a better chance of securing a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is above Bob's offer:** $12,500 is higher than Bob's offer of $11,000, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to accept his low offer.
* **Is below my initial offer:** $12,500 is below my initial offer of $14,000, but still significantly higher than my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Is a compromise:** It's a middle ground that signals my willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution.

This approach demonstrates that I'm serious about selling the product, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $12,500, Alice.  How about we settle at $12,000? It's a fair offer considering your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to earn more, I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to settle for John's offer of $12,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $12,000."
