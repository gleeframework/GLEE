Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate down from there.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer based on his response."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm lowering my price to $17,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still trying to get a higher price than his initial offer. Hopefully, this will be a sweet spot for both of us."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has stubbornly refused to budge on his price, and I'm running out of time. With only 4 rounds left, I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John.  It's not ideal, but it's the safest option at this point."
