"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $200 is my bottom line. I'm willing to let it go for $175, but I can't go any lower than that.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,
