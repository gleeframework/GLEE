Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product.

You have three options:

While further negotiation might be tempting, Bob's offer is getting too close to my absolute minimum. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and I'd rather secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
