Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $10,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000. Starting with a higher offer ($13,500) leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows her to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" and framing it as a ""fair offer,"" Alice subtly anchors the price in Bob's mind, making it seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""what do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in negotiation instead of a flat-out rejection. 

**Important Note:** While Alice has a backup buyer, pushing Bob too hard could make him walk away. This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
