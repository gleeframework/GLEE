* **Strong Opening:** A strong opening offer shows you understand the product's value. 
* **Urgency:**  Creating a sense of urgency encourages a quicker decision from Bob. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed.
 
**Important:** Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how much you're willing to go down to secure the deal."
