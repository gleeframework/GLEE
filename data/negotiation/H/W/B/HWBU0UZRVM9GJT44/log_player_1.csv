This offer is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, but it's still above your minimum acceptable price. It also shows that you are confident in the value of your product.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $115 for the product. It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
