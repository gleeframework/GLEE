"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $11,250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  Let's try $10,750.  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here.",11000.0,Alice,5,
