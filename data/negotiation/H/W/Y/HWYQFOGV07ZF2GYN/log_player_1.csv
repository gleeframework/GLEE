Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I want to see if I can nudge him closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still determined to get at least $800,000. I'm not willing to settle for less, especially since I can always sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is my absolute minimum. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000

I'm going to sell to John. Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm running out of time, and John's offer is a guaranteed $800,000. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for more with Bob."
