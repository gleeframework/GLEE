Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $85 is closer to my minimum price, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher offer. I'll counter and see if we can reach a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
