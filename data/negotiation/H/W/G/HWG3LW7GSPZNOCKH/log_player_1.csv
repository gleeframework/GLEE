Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but below my minimum value of $120.  This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'm hoping I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $100. This is still below my minimum value but closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer, while still allowing me some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my desired value than Bob's previous offers, it's still below my minimum value. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $120, so I'm going to sell it to him."
