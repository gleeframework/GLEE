"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($2,200,000 vs. $1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a final price closer to your desired range. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the high initial price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language (""proposing,"" ""starting point"")  signals your willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns more closely with the value I perceive in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than your target. You have room to negotiate and try to bring the price closer to your desired range. Selling to John right now would meet your minimum price but leave potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider a price of $1,800,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving significantly closer to Bob's offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain High Value Perception:** The language emphasizes the product's value, justifying the higher price point. 
* **Set New Anchor:** This counteroffer aims to establish a new anchor closer to your desired range, encouraging Bob to move closer to your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
