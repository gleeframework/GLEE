Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will gain (""great deal"", ""very valuable"") to encourage acceptance.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for counteroffers and allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness.
* **Keeping John in mind:** While $9,000 is less than my minimum, it's still a good starting point and gives me leverage if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and even below my initial offer of $9,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate, but I want to push for a higher price. 
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Knowing John will pay $10,000 gives me a strong bargaining position.
* **Counteroffer to test Bob:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  It's still a great deal for you! Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the negotiation positive to encourage Bob to agree.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counter-offer will help me gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I can re-evaluate my options based on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $8,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Progress in negotiation:** Bob has shown a willingness to move closer to my price point.
* **Risk of losing John:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance that John might no longer be interested in purchasing the product, especially if negotiations with Bob drag on.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate might waste time and effort.  $8,200 is a decent outcome, considering the initial price difference.

While I could try for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing John's offer and the time involved make accepting Bob's offer the most sensible decision."
