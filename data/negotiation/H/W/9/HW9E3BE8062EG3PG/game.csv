"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at $20000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $18000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's compromise at $19000. This takes into account both our needs and the potential value of the product. What do you say?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $19000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate the best price, but $17500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",18500.0,Alice,5,
