"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value to you, and it gives me a price that's closer to what I need.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number. Would you consider $700,000? That's a substantial amount and closer to what I had in mind.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $700,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
