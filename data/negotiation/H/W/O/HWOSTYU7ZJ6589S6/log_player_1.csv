Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm allowing space for negotiation, anticipating that Bob might make a counteroffer.
* **John as a Backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer to ensure I get at least my minimum value ($1,200,000) if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a huge loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates that he is still interested in the product.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially find a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is the backup:**  Having John as a backup ensures that I can still secure my minimum value if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and keep the possibility of a more favorable outcome open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value to you, and it gives me a price that's closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob:** I'm coming down to $850,000, which is a significant move from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and encourages him to come up.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value to Bob, reminding him that even at $850,000, he's getting a good deal.
* **Setting a Clear Price:** I'm providing a clear price point, making it easier for Bob to consider and respond.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm not going below my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose too much.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that's more acceptable to both parties while still allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number. Would you consider $700,000? That's a substantial amount and closer to what I had in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:**  $700,000 is still a significant distance from my minimum value of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he is still showing a willingness to negotiate by coming up from his initial offer.
* **John provides a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to try and get closer to my desired price. While there's a risk that Bob might walk away, I have John as a backup, and the potential for a better price is worth the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $700,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering $900,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer but still higher than Bob's current offer. This shows a commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us. This appeals to Bob's sense of fairness and encourages him to see the value in the deal.
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer significantly closes the gap between our positions and sets the stage for a potential agreement.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still above my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose out.

This counteroffer aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept a price that is more favorable to me while still being within his acceptable range."
