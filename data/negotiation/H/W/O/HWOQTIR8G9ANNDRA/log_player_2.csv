"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  You can try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John immediately would be pointless, as you're trying to save money and Alice hasn't given you any reason to believe she'll be unwilling to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating, while still leaving room for compromise. It's a reasonable starting point given my maximum budget and the fact that Alice's initial offer was at the top of my range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my ideal target. There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue exploring potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise while still pushing for a better price. It's a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000.  This is a good price, considering my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting my next offer and me being forced to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings.  It's a good deal, and it's time to secure the product."
