"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm not able to go that high right now.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  It's a good compromise that allows us to both get a fair deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,050,000?  It's closer to your last offer, and I think we can make this work.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is already a good price, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1060000.0,Alice,7,
