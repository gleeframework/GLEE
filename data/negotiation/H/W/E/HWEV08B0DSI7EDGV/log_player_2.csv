# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its worth, but also allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Please consider this offer carefully, as it represents a rare opportunity.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
