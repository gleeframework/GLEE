"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  I believe it holds tremendous value for you, potentially even more than I initially realized. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value.  Let's start with a price of $900,000.  This would still be a good profit for you, and it's a reasonable starting point for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable offer, I believe it undervalues the true potential of this product. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $1,000,000? This reflects the product's worth while still providing you a substantial return on your investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a deal, and it's a price I believe is fair considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
