"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  I believe it holds tremendous value for you, potentially even more than I initially realized. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, you want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value.  Let's start with a price of $900,000.  This would still be a good profit for you, and it's a reasonable starting point for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.  It's also well below your maximum price point.
* **Justifying the price:** The message highlights the ""actual value"" of the product, subtly suggesting it's worth less than Alice's stated price.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes that the proposed price would still be profitable for Alice, framing it as a win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable offer, I believe it undervalues the true potential of this product. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $1,000,000? This reflects the product's worth while still providing you a substantial return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum, it's still above your desired price point.  You can still potentially negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a deal, and it's a price I believe is fair considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by increasing the offer, but not by too much. It signals a desire to reach a deal without giving away too much.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the value of the product while reaffirming that $950,000 is a fair price.
* **Demonstrating Commitment:** The message emphasizes your commitment to finding a deal, suggesting that you are serious about making the purchase."
