Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.
* **Potential Acceptance:** While $80 is Bob's perceived value, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the offer as highly valuable or time-sensitive. 

**Important Note:**  It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer knowing his own valuation. However, without further information about Bob's negotiation style or potential needs, this is the offer that maximizes my potential profit."
