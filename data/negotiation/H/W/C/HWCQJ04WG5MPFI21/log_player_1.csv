Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts on this offer."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're in a strong position to aim higher with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer is significantly higher than your minimum, allowing you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potential for a higher profit margin. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You earn a significant profit beyond your minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You can counter-offer at a slightly lower price or proceed with selling to John, ensuring you still reach your $1,000,000 goal."
