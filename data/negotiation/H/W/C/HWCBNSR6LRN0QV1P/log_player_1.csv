Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $130 is higher than Bob's $100 valuation, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum of $150, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for potential back-and-forth to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $120 is tempting, I need to be closer to $135 to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above Bob's value:**  $135 is still higher than Bob's $120 offer, but closer to his perceived value than my initial offer.
* **Moving closer to my target:**  This offer is a compromise and gets me closer to my desired $150. 
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm still open to further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $135 is a bit too high for me. How about $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is still below my ideal price, it's only $5 away from my last offer.  It's also a reasonable compromise and gets me a decent profit.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether and having to sell to John for $150, which would be less profitable."
