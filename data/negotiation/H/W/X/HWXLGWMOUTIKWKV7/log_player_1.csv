"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build a positive rapport.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, making the offer seem more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have multiple rounds left and believe I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $9,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it allows us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm narrowing the gap between our positions, but still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the value the product holds for Bob to make the price seem more justifiable.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing that we can both be satisfied with the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away completely, leaving me with only John's offer of $12,000.
* **Time is a Factor:** With only 6 rounds left, it's better to secure a deal now rather than risk going through further rounds of negotiation and possibly ending up with the same price from John."
