"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's profitable for you.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you an idea of his level of interest and potential for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $150 matches the price John is willing to pay. While there might be a slight chance of getting a slightly higher price from Bob, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. Accepting John's offer ensures you get your minimum acceptable price without further delay."
