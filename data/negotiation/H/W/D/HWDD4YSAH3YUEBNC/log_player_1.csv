I'm starting with a price of $95. It's a bit above what the product is worth to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a little extra to get it. If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

$70 is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85.  This is still a fair price for me, and hopefully close enough to Bob's desired price that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $78 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal.  It's a better deal than what Bob offered in the previous round, but it's not enough to make me want to continue negotiating. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $80, I'll sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
