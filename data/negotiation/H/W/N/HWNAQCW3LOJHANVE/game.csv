"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $12,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move on to John if you're not willing to accept it.",9500.0,Bob,4,
