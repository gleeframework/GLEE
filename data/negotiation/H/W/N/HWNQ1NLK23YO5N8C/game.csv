"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its inherent value. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the market value of this type of product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This would allow us both to close the deal and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,150,000 is my ideal target, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to close the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,090,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.  I believe this price fairly compensates for the true value of the product. Let me know your decision.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
