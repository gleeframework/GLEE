Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob hesitates. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle somewhere above your minimum. 
* **Understand Value:**  You know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so starting significantly higher allows you to gauge his true interest and potentially capture some of the value he places on it. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't need to sell the product immediately. There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, and you'll get $10,000 from John. If you need the money quickly, a lower, more immediately appealing offer to Bob might be wiser."
