Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, a slightly lower price than $120 leaves a small buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob.
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering it for $119 makes it highly likely Bob will accept, as he gains $1 in value.  This is preferable to the guaranteed $100 from John."
