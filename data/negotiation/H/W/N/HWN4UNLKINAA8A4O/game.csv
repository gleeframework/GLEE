"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,250,000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
