"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than both her value and my upper limit. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening, but it's still above her product's value to her. This aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving space for Alice to counter, allowing us to hopefully meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $11,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  I'm willing to be patient, as I still have plenty of rounds left before I need to consider John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer aims to find a compromise that's fair to both of us. It's the exact midpoint between our previous offers.
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering Alice her product's exact value, I'm gauging her willingness to accept a smaller profit margin. 
* **Alternative Still Available:** I'm comfortable holding firm at this price for now, knowing I can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
