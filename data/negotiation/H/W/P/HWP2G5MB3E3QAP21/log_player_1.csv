Round 2

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and it's worth trying to get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

$75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still a little too low. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
