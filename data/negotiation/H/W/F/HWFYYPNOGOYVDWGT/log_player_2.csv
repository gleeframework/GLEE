Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. Considering the product's value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to compromise again. I'll offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,800. Since you have a guaranteed option with John for $10,000, it makes more sense to buy from John and save the extra $800."
