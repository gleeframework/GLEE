"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $8,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $11,000 is better, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle again at $9,500? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. Considering the product's value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to compromise again. I'll offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10800.0,Alice,5,
