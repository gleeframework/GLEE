I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still holding firm to my minimum requirement. I hope this demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a profit margin."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not confident we'll reach a deal that meets my requirements.  To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'll sell the product to John."
