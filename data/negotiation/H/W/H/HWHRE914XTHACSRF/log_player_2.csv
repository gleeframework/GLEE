While $1,175,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Bob should continue negotiating to try and secure a price closer to $1,050,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While $1,150,000 is still above his ideal price, it's a good deal considering:

* He's already negotiated a significant price reduction from Alice's initial offer.
* He's only $50,000 away from his ideal price.
* Buying from John would cost him $1,500,000, significantly more than Alice's offer.

Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or he'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids unnecessary risk."
