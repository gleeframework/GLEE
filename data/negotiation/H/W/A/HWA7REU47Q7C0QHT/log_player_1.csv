Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing John is a guaranteed $150. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message implies the product is worth more than $140, potentially swaying Bob to accept.

**Why not other prices?**

* **$150 or higher:** Bob likely won't buy it for more than its value to him ($100). 
* **Significantly lower (e.g., $110-120):** This leaves potential profit on the table if Bob would have accepted a higher price."
