Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business and could greatly contribute to your success. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. While I understand its significance, my budget allows me to only consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. Would it be possible to adjust your offer to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our target and even below what we know he values the product at. We have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between your proposed price and the true value of this product is substantial. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't accept such a low offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to accept an offer higher than $900,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground that respects both our positions? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob increased his offer, we're still leaving a lot of potential profit on the table. We'll continue negotiating, but we need to push him harder towards our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect your budget constraints. Let's make this work - how about we settle on $975,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and acknowledges your budget, while still reflecting the true value of this product."",
