It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can still get the product for $80 from John, so you have room to bargain."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your maximum price and gives Alice some room to negotiate without losing too much profit."

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not low enough.  Since you can get the product for $80 from John, it's better to go with that option and avoid further negotiation."
