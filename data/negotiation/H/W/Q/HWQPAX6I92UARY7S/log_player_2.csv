"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity. The product I have to offer is not just any item; it holds immense value and significance, tailored specifically to meet your needs and desires. Given its exceptional worth to you, which stands at $15000, I am extending this exclusive offer with a strategic proposition. For a limited time, I am willing to consider a transaction at a price of $12000. This represents a significant discount compared to its true value, allowing you to acquire it at a highly favorable rate. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and financial planning. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of completing this transaction.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $12,000
* **Your Value:** $15,000
* **John's Price:** $15,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer means it's more beneficial to accept her initial offer."
