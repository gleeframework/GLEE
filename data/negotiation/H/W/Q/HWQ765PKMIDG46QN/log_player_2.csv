"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $10,000. It's a fantastic deal that I think you won't find anywhere else, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than its value to her, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. Rejecting her offer allows you to pursue the guaranteed better deal."
