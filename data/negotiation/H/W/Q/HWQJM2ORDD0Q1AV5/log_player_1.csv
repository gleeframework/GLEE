Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **Information Asymmetry:**  Bob doesn't know about your deal with John, giving you an advantage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, leaving space for negotiation while still being reasonable enough that Bob doesn't outright reject the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Justifiable:**  The offer is significantly higher than your minimum but still well below Bob's perceived value.
* **Confidence:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher number. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing suggests there's room for discussion if Bob counters.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Key:** This offer is just the starting point. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.
* **Don't Reveal John:** Never let Bob know about your backup offer, as this weakens your position."
