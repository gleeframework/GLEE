Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $150 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $149 is just below your guaranteed sale price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. It creates the perception of a deal while maximizing your potential profit. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $149. He might try to negotiate, or he might outright reject the offer. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of exceeding your minimum sale price."
