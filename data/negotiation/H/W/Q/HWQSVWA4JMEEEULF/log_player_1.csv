Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it is more than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I am serious about selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $70?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85?  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $78?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $78 is closer to my minimum, it's still below. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However,  $78 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $82?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82}
