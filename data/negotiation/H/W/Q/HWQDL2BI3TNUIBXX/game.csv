"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, my budget is limited to $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to find a deal we can both agree on.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your consideration, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I must respectfully decline the $1,900,000 offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000, which I believe is closer to the value you're seeking while still respecting my financial limits.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
