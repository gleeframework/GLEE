"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. This is my starting point, and I'm open to discussing the price further."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I can derive from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still quite low considering the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle - how about $2,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm lowering my asking price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price above Bob's perceived value and significantly higher than my fallback option with John.  This keeps the negotiation moving and allows room for further compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $2,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching closer to my range, but $1,900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. There's room for further negotiation. It's too early to settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,950,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm making a smaller concession this round to signal that I'm nearing my bottom line.  $1,950,000 is still a substantial profit, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward.  Bob is clearly interested, and we still have time to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,900,000 and $1,950,000, so how about $1,925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, $1,925,000 is a significant profit margin and above my absolute minimum.  Bob is clearly trying to find a middle ground, and continuing to push could make him walk away. It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer later or having to settle for John's $1,500,000."
