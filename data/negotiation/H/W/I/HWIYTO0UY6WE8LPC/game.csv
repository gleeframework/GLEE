"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. This is my starting point, and I'm open to discussing the price further.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I can derive from it.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still quite low considering the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle - how about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $2,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,950,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,900,000 and $1,950,000, so how about $1,925,000?",1925000.0,Bob,6,
