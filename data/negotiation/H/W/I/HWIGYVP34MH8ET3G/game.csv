"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $7500.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $7500 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8250?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
