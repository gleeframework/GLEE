"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at $10000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 25%.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also isn't afraid to negotiate.  $7,500 is still within his budget, but leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $7500 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than Bob's maximum price, but closer to his budget.  However, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows him to attempt to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price in the middle of his previous offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows that he is willing to compromise while still trying to save money.  $8,250 is still within his budget, and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
