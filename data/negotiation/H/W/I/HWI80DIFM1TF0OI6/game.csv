"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,350,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,325,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
