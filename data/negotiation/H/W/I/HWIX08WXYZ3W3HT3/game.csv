"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its incredible potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What do you think?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is way beyond my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial investment for both of us, and I believe this price reflects the product's potential for a win-win situation.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $900,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering John is willing to sell it to me for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
