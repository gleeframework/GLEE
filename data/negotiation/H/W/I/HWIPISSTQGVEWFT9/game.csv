"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a significantly lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $800,000 is your absolute limit, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at this price. However, I need to make a profit, and $800,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. My counteroffer is $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,7,
