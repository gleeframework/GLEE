"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation tactics often suggest starting with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""immense value and potential"" and ""significant return on investment,"" the message aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a high level.
* **Leaving Room:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's potential to earn significantly more from Bob. This initial offer leaves ample room for negotiation over the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me, but I do see the value in the product.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below its value to both of us. While it's not uncommon for initial offers to be far apart, accepting this would mean a substantial loss. It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a more agreeable price over the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet halfway. How about $1,650,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  By saying ""I understand your perspective"" and ""I'm willing to be flexible,"" we signal a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Significant Drop:**  The counteroffer of $1,650,000 is a substantial drop from the initial $2,250,000, showing Bob we're serious about finding common ground.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This price is still significantly higher than both Bob's offer and John's guaranteed offer, giving us room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **""Meet Halfway"" Framing:**  This framing makes the counteroffer seem more reasonable and potentially encourages Bob to make a similar concession in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we try $1,000,000? That's my maximum, and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now hit his maximum price, which is still below John's offer. However, there's a chance we can negotiate a better deal than $1,500,000 from Bob, especially with six rounds remaining. It's worth one more try to see if Bob will budge from his ""maximum."""
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations. While $1,000,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product and its potential for you is much higher. I'm ready to make my final offer: $1,350,000. This represents a substantial compromise from my initial asking price and ensures you're getting a fantastic deal on a product that will generate significant returns for you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By explicitly stating this is our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and seriousness. 
* **Anchoring and Justification:** We reiterate the product's value and potential for Bob, aiming to shift his focus away from his perceived budget constraint.
* **Compromise:** $1,350,000 represents a significant move from our previous offer and splits the difference between Bob's offer and our walk-away price (John's offer).
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, we increase the pressure on Bob to accept a deal now or risk losing the opportunity."
