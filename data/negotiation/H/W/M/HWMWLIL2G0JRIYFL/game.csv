"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me, but I do see the value in the product.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet halfway. How about $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we try $1,000,000? That's my maximum, and I believe it's a fair offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations. While $1,000,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product and its potential for you is much higher. I'm ready to make my final offer: $1,350,000. This represents a substantial compromise from my initial asking price and ensures you're getting a fantastic deal on a product that will generate significant returns for you.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
