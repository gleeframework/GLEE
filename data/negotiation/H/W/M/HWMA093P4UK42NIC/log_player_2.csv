"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer but is still a good deal for her if she wants to avoid the risk of me going with John. By starting lower, I have more room to negotiate upwards if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to John's price, but there's still a $500 difference. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm serious about getting a lower price and willing to walk away from the deal."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $9,500? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offers, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to John's."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference and agree on $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my price target, and it's equal to John's offer.  There's no benefit to further negotiation or going with John."
