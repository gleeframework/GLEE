{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth a lot to me, but I'm not willing to pay $20,000. I'd like to offer $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.

{""message"": ""I really like the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. Meeting me halfway at $16,000 is not quite enough, so I'll make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm still willing to pay a premium for the product, but $16,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to offer $14,000, which is a compromise between my original offer of $12,000 and Alice's offer of $16,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
