"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. It's a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation. It's also high enough that I'm still earning a profit.  I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm ready to negotiate if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't accept $9,500. It's still well below my minimum value of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,500. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also serious about getting a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is stubborn and won't budge. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but if he doesn't show any willingness to meet me halfway, I'm ready to sell to John and get my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $10,000. This is a significant concession, but I still believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Bob needs to show some willingness to meet me halfway, or I'll have to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob isn't willing to compromise, and I'm running out of time. This is getting frustrating.  I'm going to sell to John and get the price I deserve. I've made multiple concessions, but Bob is being unreasonable. It's time to move on."
