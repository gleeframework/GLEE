Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident this is a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a mutually beneficial deal. This approach aims to encourage Bob to accept and avoid unnecessary back-and-forth. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a quick negotiation, as I can always sell to John for my desired price. 

By starting with a reasonable offer, I hope to secure a quick sale at a price that is closer to my ideal value than Bob's initial assessment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value. Selling to John right now guarantees me my minimum, but I'm hoping to get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that is exactly in between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the mutually beneficial aspect of the deal to encourage Bob to accept. I'm also using a positive and optimistic tone to create a sense of urgency and avoid further negotiation.

This counteroffer is a calculated move. I'm not willing to accept Bob's initial offer, but I'm also not keen on the risk of losing a potential sale and then having to sell to John at a lower price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting dangerously close to his initial valuation of $1,000,000. This indicates that further negotiation will likely result in an even lower offer, potentially jeopardizing my goal of reaching at least $1,500,000.

It's time to cut my losses and move on to a guaranteed sale with John. While it's not ideal to sell for my minimum, it's a more sensible choice than continuing to negotiate with Bob, who seems determined to push the price down further."
