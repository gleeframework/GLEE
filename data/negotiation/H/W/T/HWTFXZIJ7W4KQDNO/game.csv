"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me there?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. Can you consider that?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $88.50?  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",88.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $88.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $86, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",86.0,Bob,6,
