Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair compromise.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It makes the most sense to take the sure thing."
