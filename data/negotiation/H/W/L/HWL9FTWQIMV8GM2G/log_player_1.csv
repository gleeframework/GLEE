Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We are still significantly below the value of the product and what John is offering.  We need to nudge Bob closer to our range."

Bob is still incrementing his offers in relatively small amounts. It's time to increase the pressure and make him aware that we have other options if we don't reach a satisfactory agreement soon."

After that, I'll need to move forward with the other interested party."",
