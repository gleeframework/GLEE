"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe has significant value for your business. My initial price is $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the opportunity it presents for you. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant investment for me.  I believe this price is fair considering the value I place on the product and the opportunity it presents.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. Let's continue the conversation and see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle. This price allows you to make a decent profit while giving me a chance to acquire the product. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is still below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $925,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  It seems we're getting closer, and I believe with a little more compromise we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a significant amount for me.  This offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident it allows you to make a substantial profit. I believe a little flexibility on your end will make this deal work for both of us.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $910,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $917,500. This price allows us both to gain something from this deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this agreement.  We're so close to making this happen!",917500.0,Alice,7,
