"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to negotiate. To start, how about we aim for a price slightly above what it's worth to you, at $135? This would ensure both of us are satisfied with the transaction.",135.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $135 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to pay $110 for this product, considering it's worth $120 to you.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, given the value of the product to us, I'd like to propose a price of $120. This aligns closely with its perceived value to you and offers a fair compromise. I believe this could be a beneficial deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This would still leave you with a profit, and it's the highest I can go at this point.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a win-win situation, I am willing to accept $117 for the product. This price allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",117.0,Alice,5,
