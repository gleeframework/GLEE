"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, there's room to counter Alice's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me there, I'll need to explore other options. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is your maximum price, and you're also able to get the product from John at that price.  There's no reason to continue negotiating."
