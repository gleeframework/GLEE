"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me there, I'll need to explore other options. Let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
