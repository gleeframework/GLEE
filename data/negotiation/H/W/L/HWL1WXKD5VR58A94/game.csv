"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.
