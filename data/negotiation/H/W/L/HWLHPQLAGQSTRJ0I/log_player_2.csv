# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $120 is still higher than your target price of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $105?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Alice is willing to compromise, so there's a chance you can get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $115 is still a bit out of my range. Would you consider $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product without going over budget."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $112.50. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've successfully negotiated the price down from $120 to $112.50.  While you would ideally like a lower price, you are within your budget and Alice has stated it's her final offer.  At this point, it makes sense to accept her offer and avoid potentially losing the deal entirely."
