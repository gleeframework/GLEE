"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that gives you a good price and allows me to reach a decent profit. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us. If you're serious about getting this product, I'm confident we can close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
