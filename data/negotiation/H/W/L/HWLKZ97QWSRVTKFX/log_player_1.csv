Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price, and still gives you a substantial profit margin. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's value:**  $12,000 is more than the $8,000 Bob is willing to pay, so it's in his interest to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum:**  It's below your minimum of $15,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects.
* **Positive and persuasive:** The message emphasizes the benefits for both parties, increasing the chances of Bob accepting. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. We'll have to see how Bob reacts and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that gives you a good price and allows me to reach a decent profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough.  I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $10,000 at this point.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

If you're serious about getting this product, I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
