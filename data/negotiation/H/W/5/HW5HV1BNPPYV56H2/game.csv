"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your offer, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit to $950000. This reflects the unique value of the product and its potential for your business. Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $950000. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd like to offer $920000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. While I'm eager to find a solution, $920000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer, so my new offer is $935000.  This price still leaves a good margin for you, and I believe this product will bring significant value to your business.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd like to offer $915000 for the product. Can you consider this revised price?",915000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest and persistence.  $915000 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's split the difference - my final offer is $925000.  This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for the final offer, Alice. I understand that this is your best price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'd like to offer $910000 for the product. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can consider it.",910000.0,Bob,8,
