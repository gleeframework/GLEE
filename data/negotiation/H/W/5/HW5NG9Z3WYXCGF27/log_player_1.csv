While I could push for more, accepting $1,650,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Strong Profit:** It's a significant profit margin above my minimum.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing might yield smaller increments or risk Bob walking.
* **Time Value:** A deal now is better than an uncertain outcome later."
