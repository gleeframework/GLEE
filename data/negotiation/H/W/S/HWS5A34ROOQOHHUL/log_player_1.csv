It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are small compared to the risk of losing the sale.
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob has consistently expressed interest and is clearly trying to make this work. Accepting now capitalizes on his willingness to buy.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate delays the sale and prevents us from pursuing other opportunities. 

While $18,000 was the goal, $17,500 is a strong price, and waiting longer might result in a lower final offer or losing Bob altogether."
