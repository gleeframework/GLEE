Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This price is a starting point that's higher than your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and make Bob feel valued. It also highlights the product's potential benefits.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the need to reach an agreement. It's important to stay open to negotiation, but also to keep in mind your minimum value and the option to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is your minimum value, and you have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay the same amount.  There is no benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob.  While you could attempt to counteroffer, there's no guarantee that Bob will accept, and it risks delaying the sale. 

By selling to John, you secure the sale quickly and ensure you get your desired minimum value."
