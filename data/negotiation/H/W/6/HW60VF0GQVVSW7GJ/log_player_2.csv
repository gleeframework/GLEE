"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a very reasonable price of $115. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $115 is a bit too close to my maximum budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

While $110 is better, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try one more time to get closer to $100."

This offer attempts to split the difference again while signaling this is my last move. If she rejects it, I'll go with John."
