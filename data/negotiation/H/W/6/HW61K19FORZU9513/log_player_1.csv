Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,000 by selling to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $14,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation if he's highly interested.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose anything. I can proceed with selling to John at my desired minimum price."
