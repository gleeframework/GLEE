"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
