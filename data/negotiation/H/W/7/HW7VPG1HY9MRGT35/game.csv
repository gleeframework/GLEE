"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still slightly higher than I'd like to spend.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1050000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a fair price and me to acquire the product within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to have a constructive conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1080000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
