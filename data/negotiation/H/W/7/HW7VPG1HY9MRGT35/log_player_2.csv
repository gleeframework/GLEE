"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. There's no immediate advantage to accepting. By rejecting, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price. If unsuccessful, you can always purchase from John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to try negotiating further to potentially secure a better deal.  If I can't get the price lower, I can always buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still slightly higher than I'd like to spend.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a fair price and me to acquire the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to have a constructive conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1080000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and we're now only $30,000 apart. It's worth accepting her offer at this point. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely, and buying from John would cost more."
