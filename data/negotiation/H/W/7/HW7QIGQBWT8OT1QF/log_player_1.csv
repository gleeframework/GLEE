Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in adjusting your offer. Based on my budgetary considerations, I would like to propose a purchase price of $980,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

``` 

Bob is highly unlikely to move significantly from his current offer. Accepting his offer at $980,000 would mean a loss of $220,000 compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
