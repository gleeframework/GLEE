Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary, but also allows for the possibility of a quick deal at a good price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've made a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth accepting or if I should make a new counteroffer.
* **If Bob's counteroffer is too low:** I'll politely decline and make a new counteroffer closer to my preferred price.
* **If the negotiation stalls:** I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000, ensuring a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's not a good deal for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my desired price range.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to my desired price point, but still lower than my minimum. This will show him I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't accept a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer to Bob, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but still lower than my previous offer. This shows I'm flexible.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product, hinting that $9,500 is a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and respectful tone, hoping to encourage Bob to continue negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Excellent!  I've secured a decent price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer.  
* **If Bob's offer is too low:** I might make another counteroffer, or I might decide to sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my desired price range. While it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's a reasonable compromise. Considering the potential for further negotiation to be time-consuming and uncertain, accepting Bob's offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the sale with Bob and move on to other business opportunities."
