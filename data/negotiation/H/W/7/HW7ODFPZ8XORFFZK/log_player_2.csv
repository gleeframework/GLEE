"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, you can potentially save more by negotiating with Alice. You have a significant margin (your max is $1,200,000, and Alice's minimum is $800,000). It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, but it's still above Alice's minimum price, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject your counteroffer, and you might end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal for you at $950,000, which is within your budget and a significant saving compared to John."
