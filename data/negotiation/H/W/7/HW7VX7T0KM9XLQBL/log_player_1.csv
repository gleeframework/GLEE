"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000.  It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation while still setting a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in your product, $1800000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  To start negotiations, I'd like to offer $800000. This is my maximum budget for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested in the product. There's room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Sell to John is not a good option yet:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I have more rounds to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm countering with a price that's still higher than my minimum but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Maintaining value emphasis:** I'm still highlighting the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Seeking compromise:** My message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground,"" implying a willingness to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.  I'm eager to work with you, but I won't go higher than this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,200,000 I need. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's willingness to go higher than his initial offer suggests he might be willing to negotiate further. 
* **More rounds to explore:** I have more rounds to work with Bob and try to get closer to my desired price. Selling to John now would be a missed opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is directly in between my minimum and Bob's latest offer. This signals my willingness to compromise and reach a deal.
* **Emphasis on value and compromise:**  I reiterate the value of the product while also presenting this price as a fair compromise.
* **Closing the deal:**  The message expresses a desire to close the deal and move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm prepared to offer $1100000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's try to reach a final agreement.  I'm not sure I can go higher than this, but I'm eager to make this deal work.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still $100,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** I have fewer rounds left to negotiate, but I'm not desperate yet. I still have a chance to push for a better price.
* **John is not a good option yet:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, I still have a chance to get a better price from Bob, and a higher price is always desirable."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is just a small step away from your last offer. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, but I can't go lower. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

* **Emphasizing commitment:**  I state my commitment to reaching a deal, implying that I'm serious about making this sale happen.
* **Finality without desperation:**  The message suggests that I'm near my bottom line but not desperate to sell, making it more likely for Bob to meet me halfway."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm prepared to offer $1125000 for the product. This is a very fair price considering our previous offers.  I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. Let's get this done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  We are down to two rounds left.  I need to make a decision quickly but not make a rash choice.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate further, suggesting there's still room for a higher price.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** While John's offer is a guaranteed $1,200,000, I might still be able to get a better price from Bob in the next round.  I have to weigh the risk of losing the deal to John against the potential of a higher price."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  your offer is getting very close.  I'm willing to go down to $1,175,000.  This is a final offer, and it reflects the true value of this product. I believe it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal now. "", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  This message clearly states that this is my final offer. This puts pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Small Compromise:** My offer is only $50,000 higher than Bob's last one, demonstrating a real effort to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify the price, reminding Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing the need to finalize the deal, creating urgency and motivating Bob to accept.

**Important Consideration:** 

* **John's Offer:** With only one round left, John's offer becomes more appealing.  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, selling to John might be the best option. However, there's still a chance to get a better price."
