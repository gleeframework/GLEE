"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than $150 (John's price), there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob's initial counteroffer of $100 is a significant drop from Alice's $120. This shows Bob is serious about negotiation and is willing to compromise.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  $100 is still within Bob's $150 limit, so he's not risking overspending yet. 
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still room for Alice to counter without dropping below her $80 floor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that 120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for 110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer of $120, it's still above Bob's target price and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Staying Within Budget:** Bob is still within his $150 budget, making rejection a safe option.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down a bit further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $110 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** Bob's counteroffer of $105 is a small step closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price.
* **Staying Within Budget:** $105 is still within Bob's $150 limit, ensuring he's not overspending.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This offer puts Bob closer to the middle ground, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting or making a counteroffer that falls within a range both parties can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at 107.50. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $107.5 is very close to Bob's target price of $100, and only slightly above.
* **Good Compromise:** Alice has moved a significant amount from her initial price. 
* **Potential for Counteroffers:**  While Bob could attempt to counter again, it's likely Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting this offer ensures a deal without risking further rounds of negotiation and potentially losing the product to another seller.
* **Time is Money:** As the negotiation continues, Bob risks running out of time and having to buy from John for a higher price."
