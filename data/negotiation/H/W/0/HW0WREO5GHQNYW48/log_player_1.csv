"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys enthusiasm and highlights the product's worth, subtly anchoring the negotiation at a higher price point. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This first offer helps gauge Bob's willingness to pay and sets the stage for subsequent rounds. I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but always keeping my walk-away option (selling to John) in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am currently working with a budget constraint. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His message suggests a budget constraint, which might not be absolute. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm aiming higher while leaving the door open for further discussion. I'm confident I can secure a better deal than my guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have budget considerations, but $1,500,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,650,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Ground, But Holding Firm:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns with a smaller price reduction, but I'm still holding above the halfway point between our last offers ($1,800,000 and $1,500,000). 
* **Finding Common Ground:**  Phrasing like ""meet in the middle"" encourages a collaborative approach and suggests fairness. 
* **Maintaining Value Emphasis:**  The message subtly reminds Bob of the product's unique advantages, reinforcing its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the current market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,550,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's interested.  We are getting closer to my minimum, but I still think I can get a bit more, especially with 6 rounds remaining. The risk of losing him entirely by rejecting and countering is becoming more significant, but for now, I think it's manageable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your persistence. Let's close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Urgency:** I'm now signaling a desire to finalize the deal by using phrases like ""let's close this deal.""
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm highlighting the price reduction from my initial offer to make $1,600,000 seem more appealing. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While I could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing Bob entirely increases. This offer represents a strong profit margin, and accepting a smaller concession at this point seems prudent."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final price of $1,575,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value and Diminishing Returns:**  With only 5 rounds left, the potential gains from further negotiation are shrinking. Accepting now secures a significant profit ($375,000 above my minimum) without risking a stalemate. 
* **Bob's ""Final Price"" Signal:**  Bob's language suggests he may be reaching his upper limit. Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Strong Overall Deal:** Even though it's slightly below my target, $1,575,000 is a very good outcome. It's important to recognize a favorable deal when it's on the table."
