"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify $11,500. Would you be willing to accept $11,000? I feel that would be a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
