It's time to cut bait. Alice has made it clear she won't go down to $80. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a real risk she'll dig in, and you'll end up paying more than John's price anyway.  You've successfully gotten her down quite a bit, but John's guaranteed offer is the best choice now."
