Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This is a good starting point, as it's a significant amount of money for you, while still leaving room for negotiation. It also reflects the fact that Bob values the product higher than you do.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is a good deal, it's still below your initial offer and significantly lower than what Bob values the product at. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a substantial portion of the value you place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is better than selling to John, it's still a significant drop from your initial offer and leaves a lot of value on the table.  We need to see if we can get closer to our goal of $1,350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This counteroffer is another compromise, but it's moving closer to Bob's offer. We're still leaving room for negotiation, but at this point, it's becoming clear that we might not be able to get our full desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While it's not our ideal price, $1,075,000 is significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  At this point, it's likely that Bob won't budge much further, and we risk losing a sale entirely.  It's time to accept the offer and move on."
