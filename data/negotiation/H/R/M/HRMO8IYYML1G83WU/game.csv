"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,000,000. I'm confident that you'll find this price more reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for this product, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  If this isn't acceptable, I will have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
