"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,100,000. How about we meet at $1,075,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference at $1,087,500? This is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about we try $1,075,000 again? I'm willing to stick with this price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
