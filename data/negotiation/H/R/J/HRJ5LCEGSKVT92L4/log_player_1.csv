Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $85 right now. What do you think?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is tempting, I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. How about $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 4
