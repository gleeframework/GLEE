Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a comfortable margin for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.
