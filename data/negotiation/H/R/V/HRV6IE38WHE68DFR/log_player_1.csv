Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive tone encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** This offer is likely to be rejected by Bob, opening the door for counteroffers and potential negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I can still try to get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise.
* **John is a safe alternative:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage during negotiation and ensures I don't settle for a price that is too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is above Bob's offer:** My counteroffer of $8,500 is higher than Bob's offer of $6,500, showing my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $8,500 is a middle ground between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $6,500.
* **Positive tone:**  Using a positive and reasonable tone encourages Bob to consider my offer and potentially reach an agreement.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  I still have John's offer of $12,000 in mind, which gives me room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, and I appreciate you coming down. I could do $7,200. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $7,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I can still try to get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise.
* **John is my safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage during negotiation and ensures I don't settle for a price that is too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  $7,200 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to go up to $7,800?  I'm really trying to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This counteroffer of $7,800 shows I'm willing to compromise further, getting closer to Bob's offer of $7,200.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $7,800 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Positive and persuasive tone:**  The message uses a friendly and persuasive tone, emphasizing my desire to reach an agreement.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  I still have John's offer of $12,000 in mind, which gives me room to negotiate further if necessary."
