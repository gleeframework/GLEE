You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is substantially lower than Alice's starting price. While it might seem aggressive, it leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  It's closer to my target price and still potentially profitable for Alice, especially since she values the product lower than her initial asking price.
* **John as a Backup:** I always have the option to walk away and buy from John at $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not there yet:** Alice lowered her price, which is good, but it's still $500 above what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Alice might be willing to go a bit lower, especially since my last counter-offer was quite low. 
* **John as Leverage:**  I can use John's offer as leverage without revealing it directly.  

I'll aim for a counter-offer closer to $8,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, and I appreciate you coming down. I could do $7,200. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her current offer ($8,500) and my previous offer ($6,500). 
* **Strategic Compromise:**  It shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but not without significant movement on her end as well.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  It keeps me below John's $8,000 price, preserving my alternative option if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  $7,200 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to go up to $7,800?  I'm really trying to make this work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Difference:** Alice's offer is now only $200 more than John's price. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome, and it carries the risk of Alice walking away. 
* **Saving Money:**  While not ideal, $7,800 is still a $200 saving compared to John's offer.

It's time to accept and secure the deal with Alice."
