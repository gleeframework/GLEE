"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This establishes a starting point and allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget. I'm confident the product is worth more than $15,000 to me, so I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe the product holds more value. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price that's fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly, but still staying above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while also demonstrating the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is closer to my desired price and is a significant improvement from his initial offer.  While I could try for more, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and me potentially ending up with John's lower offer is too high.  I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
