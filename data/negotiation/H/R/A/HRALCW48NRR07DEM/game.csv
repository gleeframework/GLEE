"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to offer it to you at a special price of $12,000. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'll sell the product to you for $9,750. This is my best and final offer.",9750.0,Alice,5,
