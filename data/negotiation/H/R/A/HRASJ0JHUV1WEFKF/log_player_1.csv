{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is clearly very interested and we're getting close to his upper limit.  We've made steady progress downward, and holding firm now might push him closer to our desired outcome.  We still have time and the option of John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm holding firm at $967,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 967500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** It's time to signal to Bob that we're reaching our limit. Holding firm on the price shows we're serious and confident in the product's value.
* **Deadline:**  Stating ""final offer"" introduces a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Alternative:** We still have John as a backup, giving us leverage."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your final offer. While I respect your valuation of the product, I am unable to meet you at $967,500. My last counteroffer is $960,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has countered at the same price twice, indicating he's unlikely to go higher. We've reached an impasse.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further negotiation risks losing John's guaranteed offer. Time is a factor, and we have a solid offer in hand.
* **Profit Maximization:** While selling to Bob at his last offer would be profitable, John's offer guarantees the maximum return, meeting our primary goal."
