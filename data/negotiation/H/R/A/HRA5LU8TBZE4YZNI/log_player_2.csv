"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

$1,500,000 is far above Bob's budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the potential of this product, $1,500,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. My initial offer is $800,000. I believe this price reflects the fair market value for this type of product, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher than your estimate. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This reflects a compromise while acknowledging the unique benefits this product offers.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a better offer than the initial one, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.

Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, considering the product's unique value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  It's worth pushing for a lower price before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to this deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,050,000. This is a compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  It reflects the true value of this product, and I'm confident you won't find a better opportunity elsewhere.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob is running out of rounds and Alice is unwilling to budge further.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John at $800,000, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially miss out on the opportunity."
